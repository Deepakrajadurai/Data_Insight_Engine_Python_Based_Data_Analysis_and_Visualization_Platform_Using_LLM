In 2023, around 72 billion euros were spent on \n\nthe energy-efficient renovation of residential, public, and com­\n\nmercial buildings, about 12 billion more than in 2021. Never­\n\ntheless, investments declined by over six percent in price-ad­\n\njusted terms, as construction prices rose sharply during this \n\ntime as well. To reach climate targets, however, significantly \n\nmore real investments in energy-efficient building renova­\n\ntion are needed, as are framework conditions in Germany \n\nand Europe. Investment aid for energy-efficient renovation \n\nmeasures also plays an important role. The German Federal \n\nGovernment increased funding for these measures for 2024 to \n\n16.7 billion euros. However, policymakers will need to provide \n\neven more funding in the future due to rising financing and \n\nconstruction costs if they actually want to increase the rate of \n\nenergy-efficient building renovation.\n\nIn its most recent report, the Council of Experts on Climate \n\nChange warned that much more progress needs to happen \n\nin the building sector than has occurred to date to reach the \n\ngreenhouse gas reduction targets in Germany.1 Reducing \n\nheating energy consumption in the building stock is one \n\nway to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For \n\nover a decade, there have been calls to improve the energy \n\ncondition of the building stock by increasing building enve­\n\nlope insulation (walls, windows, roof) and installing more \n\nefficient heating systems.2\n\nEnergy-efficient renovation is difficult to \n\nmeasure, but there are suitable indicators\n\nIt is difficult to evaluate the extent to which energy-efficient \n\nrenovation measures have actually improved the energy con­\n\ndition of the building stock over the past years. Detailed stud­\n\nies on this topic are extremely complex and only available for \n\nspecific years.3 Studies based on smaller samples can only \n\ndetermine rough trends in the development of energy-effi­\n\ncient building renovation over a few years. Moreover, they are \n\nlimited to the existing residential building stock. According \n\nto the available data, the annual energy-efficient renovation \n\nrate, which is the share of a building’s surface area that has \n\nundergone energy-efficient renovation in a certain year, has \n\nhardly changed since 2000 and is estimated to be less than \n\none percent for 2017.4\n\nAn alternative approach for measuring energy-efficient ren­\n\novation is based on the amount of money invested in this \n\ntype of renovation instead of focusing on physical indicators. \n\n1\t\n\nExpert Council on Climate Change, Review of Projection Data: Compliance with climate target \n\nfor 2021 to 2030 not confirmed.

However, it \n\nis not possible to determine the specific additional amount \n\nspent on improving energy efficiency that results, for exam­\n\nple, from installing a triple-glazed window compared to a \n\ndouble-glazed one. Nevertheless, it is possible to determine \n\nBox\n\nDetermining investments in energy-efficient building \n\nrenovation\n\nInvestments in energy-efficient building renovation are estimat­\n\ned by combining aggregate statistical official evaluations from \n\nthe DIW Construction Volume that have been broken down with \n\nextrapolated survey results from the construction service pro­\n\nvider Heinze GmbH’s Modernization Volume (Figure). The DIW \n\nConstruction Volume contains the total of all services that are \n\ninvolved in the construction or maintenance of buildings and \n\nstructures. In this respect, the Construction Volume goes beyond \n\nthe construction investment figures of the Federal Statistical Office \n\nbecause their figures do not take into account consumable con­\n\nstruction services, which are primarily repairs that do not increase \n\nin value (i.e., maintenance services provided by the main construc­\n\ntion and finishing trades). Unlike in the official statistics, the DIW \n\nConstruction Volume differentiates between construction services \n\non the existing building stock and on new buildings.\n\nExisting measures, or rather the volume of existing construction \n\nmeasures, are estimated from a macro perspective by looking at \n\nthe differences between total construction output according to \n\nconstruction statistics and new construction output derived from \n\nconstruction activity statistics.1 This has the advantage of allowing \n\nconsistent comparisons over time. However, the model calcula­\n\ntions using the difference approach lack structural information.\n\nTo identify such structural information, the results from the model \n\ncalculations based on official statistics are considered. These are \n\nthen compared with extrapolations of modernization volumes \n\nbased on surveys. The extrapolation results are based on spe­\n\ncial analyses on the years 2014, 2018, 2020, and 2022 by Heinze \n\nGmbH.2\n\nIn Heinze GmbH’s studies, the modernization volume is calculated \n\nby linking secondary statistical market data with survey results \n\nfrom target groups relevant to the modernization market. The \n\nmain source of housing market data is a survey of representatively \n\nselected tenant and owner households. In addition, commercial \n\nhousing developers are surveyed. The results for non-residen­\n\ntial construction are based on evaluations of questionnaires on \n\nmodernization measures run by architects. In addition, surveys of \n\ntradespeople are used. Using these sources, the existing meas­\n\nures can be differentiated by sector. Insulation measures (roofs, \n\nfacades, etc.); replacement of windows and exterior doors; and the \n\n1\t\n\nMartin Gornig, Claus Michelsen, and Hannah Révész, “Strukturdaten zur Produktion und Bes­\n\nchäftigung im Baugewerbe.

Struk­\n\ntur der Investitionstätigkeit in den Wohnungs- und Nichtwohnungsbeständen,” BBSR-Online-Pub­\n\nlikation 80 (2024) (in German; available online).\n\nrenewal of heating, air conditioning, and ventilation systems are \n\nconsidered components of energy-efficient renovation.\n\nStructural information on the importance of the above sectors from \n\na micro approach is consistently integrated into DIW construction \n\nvolume calculation. A prerequisite for this is that the results of \n\nthe two methods correspond with each other. This applies to the \n\nquantitative total result as well as the specific definition of con­\n\nstruction services. Thus, investment construction services are the \n\nfocus of the Heinze GmbH survey results. Due to its connection to \n\nthe architect survey, this applies to non-residential construction \n\nespecially. In the case of residential construction, on the other \n\nhand, work performed by the occupant, including neighborhood \n\nassistance and undeclared work, is not valued, unlike in the \n\nConstruction Volume.\n\nThe structural information gleaned from the Heinze GmbH surveys \n\nis therefore not directly related to the Construction Volume as a \n\nwhole, but only to the investment part. A model calculation to sep­\n\narate construction services into investment and non-investment \n\nmeasures is required to integrate the values from the structural \n\ninformation from Heinze. For this purpose, DIW Berlin specifically \n\nevaluated the structural information on repair measures from the \n\nHeinze surveys and made corresponding extrapolations for the \n\naverage maintenance measures. The measures were differentiated \n\nover time by linking them to the development of gross fixed assets \n\nin structural engineering, for which DIW Berlin developed special \n\nmodel calculations.3\n\n3\t Susanne Hotze et al., “Struktur der Bestandsinvestitionen 2014.

These gross costs are much higher than \n\nthe additional spending specifically related to energy-effi­\n\ncient renovation. Previous studies on residential construction \n\nsuggest that the investment costs are twice as high as the \n\nspecific additional spending.5\n\nThe total amount invested in energy-efficient building ren­\n\novation is estimated by breaking down aggregate statistical \n\nofficial evaluations that are a part of the DIW Construction \n\nVolume and by extrapolating survey results from the \n\nModernization Volume of the construction service provider \n\nHeinze GmbH (Box). The Federal Institute for Research \n\non Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial Development \n\n(Bundesinstitut für Bau-, Stadt- und Raumforschung, BBSR6) \n\nand the Federal Environment Agency (Umweltbundesamt, \n\nUBA7) regularly publish these results, which are based on the \n\nDIW Construction Volume and the Heinze Modernization \n\nVolume, on the investment volume in the energy-efficient \n\nrenovation of residential and non-residential buildings.\n\nFurthermore, this Weekly Report presents a differentiated eval­\n\nuation of three energy-efficient renovation sectors: roof/wall \n\ninsulation, window/door replacements, and heating/air con­\n\nditioning system renewal.8 In addition, the real development \n\nof investments in energy-efficient renovation are presented \n\nhere to account for the strong price increases of recent years. \n\nA mix of price indicators are used to measure deflation, as \n\nthe official price statistics do not directly reflect the individual \n\nenergy-efficient renovation sectors. Roof/wall insulation, win­\n\ndows/doors, and heating/air conditioning are thus assigned to \n\nprice indices for suitable product areas and economic classes.\n\nRoof/wall insulation stagnating following growth\n\nA significant share of expenditure on energy-efficient ren­\n\novation is spent on improving the insulation of the build­\n\ning envelope. At current prices, over 16 billion euros were \n\ninvested in insulating roofs, basement ceilings, and facades \n\nof residential buildings in 2023. Once again, roughly six bil­\n\nlion euros were spent on insulating commercial and public \n\nnon-residential buildings (Figure 1).\n\nThe nominal amount invested in insulation, especially of \n\nresidential buildings, increased significantly over the past \n\nyears. For example, the amount invested in the insulation \n\nof residential facades and roofs in 2023 was nearly twice as \n\nhigh as in 2018. However, when considering the enormous \n\nprice increases since 2021, the real value of investments in \n\nthe insulation of residential buildings did not increase in \n\n2022 or 2023.\n\n5\t Institut der deutschen Wirtschaft, Energetische Modernisierung des Gebäudebestandes: Her­\n\nausforderungen für private Eigentümer.

Spending on building insula­\n\ntion in the commercial and public sectors rose again from \n\n2019. However, only in 2020 were the nominal increases \n\nsufficient enough to reach the real investment level of 2013. \n\nInvestments in the insulation of non-residential buildings, \n\nin contrast, were only around 80 percent of the initial level \n\nin 2024.\n\nWindow and exterior door replacements trending \n\ndownward\n\nThe amount spent on window and exterior door replacements \n\nin residential buildings has barely changed over many years \n\n(Figure 2). For example, around 13.5 billion euros were spent \n\non window and exterior door replacements from 2017 to 2020. \n\nOnly recently has spending increased noticeably. However, \n\nthe nominal increases were considerably lower than the \n\nhigh price increases due to the extremely high costs of glass \n\nproduction. Accordingly, real investments in window/exte­\n\nrior door replacements in the past three years have declined \n\nsharply: In 2023, the real investment level was nearly 25 per­\n\ncent lower than it was in 2013.\n\nIn price-adjusted terms, investments in the replacement \n\nof windows and exterior doors of commercial and public \n\nnon-residential buildings declined even more markedly dur­\n\ning the observation period. In 2023, real investments were \n\n30 percent lower than in 2013. In nominal terms, about five \n\nbillion euros have been spent on window and exterior door \n\nreplacements by commercial and public building owners \n\nin 2024.\n\nRenewed growth in heating system renewal since \n\n2020\n\nCompared to energy-efficient retrofitting of building enve­\n\nlopes via insulation or the replacement of windows and exte­\n\nrior doors, spending on heating system renewal has expe­\n\nrienced stronger growth (Figure 3). Spending on heating \n\nsystem renewal in the residential housing stock has nearly \n\ndoubled in nominal terms over the last 10 years. Although \n\nheating construction prices rose even more sharply than \n\nprices for energy-saving measures on the building enve­\n\nlope, the increases in spending were enough to maintain a \n\nhigh level of real investments in the renewal of heating sys­\n\ntems in residential buildings. It is assumed that households \n\nare also investing in new gas heating systems before they \n\nbecome subject to strict regulations. However, investments \n\nnarrowly missed reaching the peak value of real investments \n\nfrom 2017 in 2023.\n\nInvestments in heating and air conditioning (AC) technol­\n\nogy for non-residential buildings have been on an upward \n\ntrend for many years. From 2011 to 2017, spending on heat­\n\ning and AC technology increased from roughly six to nearly \n\nnine billion euros. Moreover, because the increase in spend­\n\ning outpaced price increases in this sector, real investments \n\nrose as well. Compared to 2017, however, commercial and \n\npublic building owners’ spending has declined consider­\n\nably. As heating and AC technology prices experienced a \n\nstrong increase at the same time, real investments declined \n\nby nearly 30 percent compared to 2013.\n\nFigure 3\n\nInvestments in the renewal of heating and air conditioning \n\nsystems\n\nIn billions of euros at current prices, as an index of price-adjusted \n\nvalues, 2013 = 100\n\n50\n\n70\n\n90\n\n110\n\n130\n\n150\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\nReal index\n\nBillions of euros\n\nReal index non-residential \n\nconstruction\n\nReal index residential \n\nconstruction\n\n118.4\n\n73.2\n\n106.0\n\nResidential construction\n\nNon-residential construction\n\n109.2\n\nSources: DIW Berlin Construction Volume; Heinze GmbH Modernization Volume; authors’ calculations.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nThe development of real investments in heating and air conditioning systems differs \n\ngreatly between residential and non-residential buildings.\n\nFigure 4\n\nDevelopment of real investments in energy-efficient renovation \n\nof residential buildings, in existing building stock, and newly \n\nconstructed buildings \n\nIndex 2013 = 100\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\n120\n\n130\n\n140\n\n150\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\nEnergy-efﬁcient \n\nrenovation\n\nNew construction volume \n\nExisting stock without \n\nenergy-efﬁcient renovations\n\nSources: DIW Berlin Construction Volume; Heinze GmbH Modernization Volume; authors’ calculations.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nOverall, real investments in the energy-efficient renovation of residential buildings \n\nwere marginally higher in 2024 compared to 2014.\n\n282\n\nDIW Weekly Report 46/2024\n\nENERGY-EFFICIENT RENOVATION\n\nThere are diverse reasons for this investment restraint.9 For \n\nmany years, comparatively low oil and gas prices, which \n\nreduced pressure to undertake energy-efficient renovation, \n\nwere a significant factor. Due to the climb in energy prices \n\nsince 2021, saving energy has increased in importance as a \n\nreason for modernizing owner-occupied or rented residential \n\nbuildings (Figure 5).10 While only nine percent of investors \n\ncited energy savings as a reason for modernizing buildings \n\nin 2020, the figure had risen to 16 percent in 2022.\n\nThe parallel sharp rise in financing costs and construction \n\nprices is likely why the change in reasons for modernizing \n\nhas not been reflected in a real increase in investments in \n\nenergy-efficient renovation of residential buildings. In addi­\n\ntion, the survey on modernization reasons shows that even \n\nin 2022, increasing comfort and maintaining value were still \n\nseen as more important investment reasons, with response \n\nrates of 23 percent and 20 percent, respectively.\n\nEnergy-related renovation in commercial and \n\npublic structural engineering continuing its \n\ndownward slide\n\nCombining the results for investments in the individual \n\nsectors of energy-efficient public and commercial building \n\nrenovation results in a concerning picture. In 2023, nearly \n\n20 billion euros were spent on the energy-efficient renova­\n\ntion of non-residential buildings, around 25 percent more \n\nthan in 2013. However, as prices for construction work rose \n\nby over 50 percent during the same period, one quarter less \n\nis being invested in the energy-efficient renovation of pub­\n\nlic and commercial buildings in real terms compared to \n\n10 years ago (Figure 6).\n\nInvestment activity in energy-efficient renovation developed \n\nmarkedly worse than in other sectors of public and commer­\n\ncial structural engineering. In particular, the construction of \n\nnew buildings increased considerably. In 2023, investments in \n\nnew construction were about 25 percent higher than in 2013 in \n\nprice-adjusted terms despite the current weak phase.

The decline \n\nwas thus noticeably lower than in energy-efficient renovation.\n\nFor many years, public and commercial investors were hesi­\n\ntant to renovate buildings to improve energy efficiency, likely \n\ndue to comparatively low oil and gas prices. In addition, the \n\nstructural change in the non-residential housing stock is \n\noccurring more strongly in new construction than in residen­\n\ntial construction. Currently, it should also be noted that pub­\n\nlic authorities in particular are tied to nominal investment \n\n9\t Martin Gornig und Katrin Klarhöfer, “Investments in energy-efficient building renovation are \n\non a downward slide,” DIW Weekly Report no. 32/33 (2023): 225-232 (available online).\n\n10\t Katrin Klarhöfer, Christopher Kramp, and Christian Tiller, “Bestandsinvestitionen 2022.

However, when considering price increases, real invest­\n\nments in 2023 were barely higher than in 2013 (Figure 4). The \n\nfirst low point of real investments in energy-efficient reno­\n\nvation of residential buildings was in 2015 and was followed \n\nby a significant recovery in real investment activity. It had \n\nreached its previous peak value in 2021, when the annual total \n\ninvestment amount was about eight percent greater than the \n\nbase year value. However, the considerable price increases in \n\n2022 and 2023 almost canceled out the real growth in invest­\n\nments entirely.\n\nInvestments in the energy-efficient renovation of buildings \n\nthus developed markedly worse than in other areas of resi­\n\ndential construction. Construction of new housing in particu­\n\nlar experienced strong growth until 2020. Despite the current \n\nweak phase, investments in new construction were around \n\n11 percent higher in price-adjusted terms in 2023 than in 2013. \n\nOther measures on existing buildings, such as the moderniza­\n\ntion of sanitary facilities or general maintenance, also resulted \n\nin real growth over the entire period. In price-adjusted terms, \n\nsuch spending was 15 percent higher in 2023 than in 2013.\n\nFigure 5\n\nReasons for modernizing residential buildings\n\nShares in percent\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n2014\n\n2018\n\n2020\n\n2022\n\nSaving energy\n\nMaintaining value\n\nImproving comfort\n\nNeed for senior-friendly housing\n\nHealth considerations\n\nEnvironmental reasons\n\nNote: This information was provided by property owners who live in their own property as well as owners who rent \n\nout their property.\n\nSources: Heinze GmbH; authors’ calculations.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nWhile saving energy is still not the most important reason for modernizing, it has \n\nincreased in significance recently.\n\n283\n\nDIW Weekly Report 46/2024\n\nENERGY-EFFICIENT RENOVATION\n\nbudgets and have only been able to partially adjust their \n\nbudget estimates to the sharp rise in construction prices.\n\nConclusion: Trend reversal in energy-efficient \n\nbuilding renovation urgently needed\n\nThere is no doubt that the energy efficiency of the building \n\nstock needs urgent improvement. In light of the weak real \n\ninvestment activity in recent years, energy-efficient reno­\n\nvation of the existing building stock must be quadrupled. \n\nBinding minimum standards and renovation targets must \n\nbe set to reverse the trend in renovation activities.11 The long-\n\nterm expected development of energy prices is a decisive fac­\n\ntor for the willingness to invest in energy-efficient renovation. \n\nPolitical decisions on carbon pricing play a key role here irre­\n\nspective of fluctuating raw materials prices. A reliably fore­\n\nseeable path of further energy cost increases is essential for \n\ncreating investment incentives to reach the climate targets.\n\nFurthermore, there must be appropriate funding conditions \n\nto achieve a noticeable increase in investments in the ener­\n\ngy-efficient renovation of existing buildings. At the end of \n\n2023, the German Federal Government reorganized the fund­\n\ning measures in the building sector as part of the Climate \n\nAction Program. The Federal Funding for Efficient Buildings \n\nprogram is the main approach to energy-efficient improve­\n\nments in the building stock.12 Since the beginning of 2024, \n\nthe Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau and the Federal Office of \n\nEconomics and Export Control (Bundesamt für Wirtschaft und \n\nAusfuhrkontrolle) have made newly structured funding pro­\n\ngrams available for the energy-efficient renovation of resi­\n\ndential and non-residential buildings.\n\nThe new focus of the funding programs has been accompa­\n\nnied by a sharp increase in funding for energy-efficient ren­\n\novation. Funds in the amount of 16.7 billion euros for 2024 \n\nhave been earmarked in the Klima- und Transformationsfonds \n\nfor Federal Funding of Efficient Buildings.13 This represents \n\nan increase of almost 50 percent compared to the funding for \n\n2023.14 Compared to the long-term average, the subsidies are \n\n11\t Sophie M.

The increase in nominal funding is \n\noffset by higher construction and financing costs in particu­\n\nlar. Interest charges are likely to be almost three times higher \n\ncompared to the end of the 2010s, even after the European \n\nCentral Bank’s further interest rate cuts. Construction costs \n\nhave risen by an average of more than 40 percent in the same \n\nperiod. If policymakers really want to provide a strong impe­\n\ntus for energy-efficient renovation activities in existing resi­\n\ndential buildings, they must be prepared to invest significantly \n\nhigher amounts of funding in the coming years.\n\nWhen designing the subsidy programs, care should be taken \n\nto ensure that the approved measures can be implemented \n\nin a flexible manner.

In 2023, around 72 billion euros were spen on \n\nthe energy-efficien renovation of residential, public, and com­\n\nmercial buildings, abou 12 billion more han in 2021. Never­\n\ntheless, investments declined by over six percen in price-ad­\n\njusted erms, as construction prices rose sharply during his \n\ntime as well. To reach climate argets, however, significantly \n\nmore real investments in energy-efficien building renova­\n\ntion are needed, as are framework conditions in Germany \n\nand Europe. Investmen aid for energy-efficien renovation \n\nmeasures also plays an importan role. The German Federal \n\nGovernmen increased funding for hese measures for 2024 o \n\n16.7 billion euros. However, policymakers will need o provide \n\neven more funding in he future due o rising financing and \n\nconstruction costs if hey actually wan o increase he rate of \n\nenergy-efficien building renovation.\n\nIn its mos recen report, he Council of Experts on Climate \n\nChange warned ha much more progress needs o happen \n\nin he building sector han has occurred o date o reach he \n\ngreenhouse gas reduction argets in Germany.1 Reducing \n\nheating energy consumption in he building stock is one \n\nway o significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For \n\nover a decade, here have been calls o improve he energy \n\ncondition of he building stock by increasing building enve­\n\nlope insulation (walls, windows, roof) and installing more \n\nefficien heating systems.2\n\nEnergy-efficien renovation is difficul o \n\nmeasure, bu here are suitable indicators\n\nI is difficul o evaluate he exten o which energy-efficien \n\nrenovation measures have actually improved he energy con­\n\ndition of he building stock over he pas years. Detailed stud­\n\nies on his opic are extremely complex and only available for \n\nspecific years.3 Studies based on smaller samples can only \n\ndetermine rough rends in he developmen of energy-effi­\n\ncien building renovation over a few years. Moreover, hey are \n\nlimited o he existing residential building stock. According \n\nto he available data, he annual energy-efficien renovation \n\nrate, which is he share of a building’s surface area ha has \n\nundergone energy-efficien renovation in a certain year, has \n\nhardly changed since 2000 and is estimated o be less han \n\none percen for 2017.4\n\nAn alternative approach for measuring energy-efficien ren­\n\novation is based on he amoun of money invested in his \n\ntype of renovation instead of focusing on physical indicators. \n\n1\t\n\nExper Council on Climate Change, Review of Projection Data: Compliance with climate arge \n\nfor 2021 o 2030 no confirmed.

The DIW \n\nConstruction Volume contains he otal of all services ha are \n\ninvolved in he construction or maintenance of buildings and \n\nstructures. In his respect, he Construction Volume goes beyond \n\nthe construction investmen figures of he Federal Statistical Office \n\nbecause heir figures do no ake into accoun consumable con­\n\nstruction services, which are primarily repairs ha do no increase \n\nin value (i.e., maintenance services provided by he main construc­\n\ntion and finishing rades). Unlike in he official statistics, he DIW \n\nConstruction Volume differentiates between construction services \n\non he existing building stock and on new buildings.\n\nExisting measures, or rather he volume of existing construction \n\nmeasures, are estimated from a macro perspective by looking a \n\nthe differences between otal construction outpu according o \n\nconstruction statistics and new construction outpu derived from \n\nconstruction activity statistics.1 This has he advantage of allowing \n\nconsisten comparisons over ime. However, he model calcula­\n\ntions using he difference approach lack structural information.\n\nTo identify such structural information, he results from he model \n\ncalculations based on official statistics are considered. These are \n\nthen compared with extrapolations of modernization volumes \n\nbased on surveys. The extrapolation results are based on spe­\n\ncial analyses on he years 2014, 2018, 2020, and 2022 by Heinze \n\nGmbH.2\n\nIn Heinze GmbH’s studies, he modernization volume is calculated \n\nby linking secondary statistical marke data with survey results \n\nfrom arge groups relevan o he modernization market. The \n\nmain source of housing marke data is a survey of representatively \n\nselected enan and owner households. In addition, commercial \n\nhousing developers are surveyed. The results for non-residen­\n\ntial construction are based on evaluations of questionnaires on \n\nmodernization measures run by architects. In addition, surveys of \n\ntradespeople are used. Using hese sources, he existing meas­\n\nures can be differentiated by sector.

Spending on building insula­\n\ntion in he commercial and public sectors rose again from \n\n2019. However, only in 2020 were he nominal increases \n\nsufficien enough o reach he real investmen level of 2013. \n\nInvestments in he insulation of non-residential buildings, \n\nin contrast, were only around 80 percen of he initial level \n\nin 2024.\n\nWindow and exterior door replacements rending \n\ndownward\n\nThe amoun spen on window and exterior door replacements \n\nin residential buildings has barely changed over many years \n\n(Figure 2). For example, around 13.5 billion euros were spen \n\non window and exterior door replacements from 2017 o 2020. \n\nOnly recently has spending increased noticeably. However, \n\nthe nominal increases were considerably lower han he \n\nhigh price increases due o he extremely high costs of glass \n\nproduction. Accordingly, real investments in window/exte­\n\nrior door replacements in he pas hree years have declined \n\nsharply: In 2023, he real investmen level was nearly 25 per­\n\ncen lower han i was in 2013.\n\nIn price-adjusted erms, investments in he replacemen \n\nof windows and exterior doors of commercial and public \n\nnon-residential buildings declined even more markedly dur­\n\ning he observation period. In 2023, real investments were \n\n30 percen lower han in 2013. In nominal erms, abou five \n\nbillion euros have been spen on window and exterior door \n\nreplacements by commercial and public building owners \n\nin 2024.\n\nRenewed growth in heating system renewal since \n\n2020\n\nCompared o energy-efficien retrofi ing of building enve­\n\nlopes via insulation or he replacemen of windows and exte­\n\nrior doors, spending on heating system renewal has expe­\n\nrienced stronger growth (Figure 3). Spending on heating \n\nsystem renewal in he residential housing stock has nearly \n\ndoubled in nominal erms over he las 10 years. Although \n\nheating construction prices rose even more sharply han \n\nprices for energy-saving measures on he building enve­\n\nlope, he increases in spending were enough o maintain a \n\nhigh level of real investments in he renewal of heating sys­\n\ntems in residential buildings. I is assumed ha households \n\nare also investing in new gas heating systems before hey \n\nbecome subjec o stric regulations. However, investments \n\nnarrowly missed reaching he peak value of real investments \n\nfrom 2017 in 2023.\n\nInvestments in heating and air conditioning (AC) echnol­\n\nogy for non-residential buildings have been on an upward \n\ntrend for many years. From 2011 o 2017, spending on heat­\n\ning and AC echnology increased from roughly six o nearly \n\nnine billion euros. Moreover, because he increase in spend­\n\ning outpaced price increases in his sector, real investments \n\nrose as well. Compared o 2017, however, commercial and \n\npublic building owners’ spending has declined consider­\n\nably. As heating and AC echnology prices experienced a \n\nstrong increase a he same ime, real investments declined \n\nby nearly 30 percen compared o 2013.\n\nFigure 3\n\nInvestments in he renewal of heating and air conditioning \n\nsystems\n\nIn billions of euros a curren prices, as an index of price-adjusted \n\nvalues, 2013 = 100\n\n50\n\n70\n\n90\n\n110\n\n130\n\n150\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\nReal index\n\nBillions of euros\n\nReal index non-residential \n\nconstruction\n\nReal index residential \n\nconstruction\n\n118.4\n\n73.2\n\n106.0\n\nResidential construction\n\nNon-residential construction\n\n109.2\n\nSources: DIW Berlin Construction Volume; Heinze GmbH Modernization Volume; authors’ calculations.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nThe developmen of real investments in heating and air conditioning systems differs \n\ngreatly between residential and non-residential buildings.\n\nFigure 4\n\nDevelopmen of real investments in energy-efficien renovation \n\nof residential buildings, in existing building stock, and newly \n\nconstructed buildings \n\nIndex 2013 = 100\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\n120\n\n130\n\n140\n\n150\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\nEnergy-efﬁcien \n\nrenovation\n\nNew construction volume \n\nExisting stock withou \n\nenergy-efﬁcien renovations\n\nSources: DIW Berlin Construction Volume; Heinze GmbH Modernization Volume; authors’ calculations.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nOverall, real investments in he energy-efficien renovation of residential buildings \n\nwere marginally higher in 2024 compared o 2014.\n\n282\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 46/2024\n\nENERGY-EFFICIENT RENOVATION\n\nThere are diverse reasons for his investmen restraint.9 For \n\nmany years, comparatively low oil and gas prices, which \n\nreduced pressure o undertake energy-efficien renovation, \n\nwere a significan factor. Due o he climb in energy prices \n\nsince 2021, saving energy has increased in importance as a \n\nreason for modernizing owner-occupied or rented residential \n\nbuildings (Figure 5).10 While only nine percen of investors \n\ncited energy savings as a reason for modernizing buildings \n\nin 2020, he figure had risen o 16 percen in 2022.\n\nThe parallel sharp rise in financing costs and construction \n\nprices is likely why he change in reasons for modernizing \n\nhas no been reflected in a real increase in investments in \n\nenergy-efficien renovation of residential buildings. In addi­\n\ntion, he survey on modernization reasons shows ha even \n\nin 2022, increasing comfor and maintaining value were still \n\nseen as more importan investmen reasons, with response \n\nrates of 23 percen and 20 percent, respectively.\n\nEnergy-related renovation in commercial and \n\npublic structural engineering continuing its \n\ndownward slide\n\nCombining he results for investments in he individual \n\nsectors of energy-efficien public and commercial building \n\nrenovation results in a concerning picture. In 2023, nearly \n\n20 billion euros were spen on he energy-efficien renova­\n\ntion of non-residential buildings, around 25 percen more \n\nthan in 2013. However, as prices for construction work rose \n\nby over 50 percen during he same period, one quarter less \n\nis being invested in he energy-efficien renovation of pub­\n\nlic and commercial buildings in real erms compared o \n\n10 years ago (Figure 6).\n\nInvestmen activity in energy-efficien renovation developed \n\nmarkedly worse han in other sectors of public and commer­\n\ncial structural engineering. In particular, he construction of \n\nnew buildings increased considerably. In 2023, investments in \n\nnew construction were abou 25 percen higher han in 2013 in \n\nprice-adjusted erms despite he curren weak phase. Measures \n\nother han energy-efficiency measures on existing buildings \n\nalso suffered real losses. In price-adjusted erms, spending \n\nwas 17 percen lower in 2023 compared o 2013. The decline \n\nwas hus noticeably lower han in energy-efficien renovation.\n\nFor many years, public and commercial investors were hesi­\n\ntan o renovate buildings o improve energy efficiency, likely \n\ndue o comparatively low oil and gas prices. In addition, he \n\nstructural change in he non-residential housing stock is \n\noccurring more strongly in new construction han in residen­\n\ntial construction. Currently, i should also be noted ha pub­\n\nlic authorities in particular are ied o nominal investmen \n\n9\t Martin Gornig und Katrin Klarhöfer, “Investments in energy-efficien building renovation are \n\non a downward slide,” DIW Weekly Repor no. 32/33 (2023): 225-232 (available online).\n\n10\t Katrin Klarhöfer, Christopher Kramp, and Christian Tiller, “Bestandsinvestitionen 2022.

However, when considering price increases, real invest­\n\nments in 2023 were barely higher han in 2013 (Figure 4). The \n\nfirs low poin of real investments in energy-efficien reno­\n\nvation of residential buildings was in 2015 and was followed \n\nby a significan recovery in real investmen activity. I had \n\nreached its previous peak value in 2021, when he annual otal \n\ninvestmen amoun was abou eigh percen greater han he \n\nbase year value. However, he considerable price increases in \n\n2022 and 2023 almos canceled ou he real growth in invest­\n\nments entirely.\n\nInvestments in he energy-efficien renovation of buildings \n\nthus developed markedly worse han in other areas of resi­\n\ndential construction. Construction of new housing in particu­\n\nlar experienced strong growth until 2020. Despite he curren \n\nweak phase, investments in new construction were around \n\n11 percen higher in price-adjusted erms in 2023 han in 2013. \n\nOther measures on existing buildings, such as he moderniza­\n\ntion of sanitary facilities or general maintenance, also resulted \n\nin real growth over he entire period. In price-adjusted erms, \n\nsuch spending was 15 percen higher in 2023 han in 2013.\n\nFigure 5\n\nReasons for modernizing residential buildings\n\nShares in percent\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n2014\n\n2018\n\n2020\n\n2022\n\nSaving energy\n\nMaintaining value\n\nImproving comfort\n\nNeed for senior-friendly housing\n\nHealth considerations\n\nEnvironmental reasons\n\nNote: This information was provided by property owners who live in heir own property as well as owners who ren \n\nou heir property.\n\nSources: Heinze GmbH; authors’ calculations.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nWhile saving energy is still no he mos importan reason for modernizing, i has \n\nincreased in significance recently.\n\n283\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 46/2024\n\nENERGY-EFFICIENT RENOVATION\n\nbudgets and have only been able o partially adjus heir \n\nbudge estimates o he sharp rise in construction prices.\n\nConclusion: Trend reversal in energy-efficien \n\nbuilding renovation urgently needed\n\nThere is no doub ha he energy efficiency of he building \n\nstock needs urgen improvement. In ligh of he weak real \n\ninvestmen activity in recen years, energy-efficien reno­\n\nvation of he existing building stock mus be quadrupled. \n\nBinding minimum standards and renovation argets mus \n\nbe se o reverse he rend in renovation activities.11 The long-\n\nterm expected developmen of energy prices is a decisive fac­\n\ntor for he willingness o inves in energy-efficien renovation. \n\nPolitical decisions on carbon pricing play a key role here irre­\n\nspective of fluctuating raw materials prices. A reliably fore­\n\nseeable path of further energy cos increases is essential for \n\ncreating investmen incentives o reach he climate argets.\n\nFurthermore, here mus be appropriate funding conditions \n\nto achieve a noticeable increase in investments in he ener­\n\ngy-efficien renovation of existing buildings. A he end of \n\n2023, he German Federal Governmen reorganized he fund­\n\ning measures in he building sector as par of he Climate \n\nAction Program. The Federal Funding for Efficien Buildings \n\nprogram is he main approach o energy-efficien improve­\n\nments in he building stock.12 Since he beginning of 2024, \n\nthe Kreditanstal für Wiederaufbau and he Federal Office of \n\nEconomics and Expor Control (Bundesam für Wirtschaf und \n\nAusfuhrkontrolle) have made newly structured funding pro­\n\ngrams available for he energy-efficien renovation of resi­\n\ndential and non-residential buildings.\n\nThe new focus of he funding programs has been accompa­\n\nnied by a sharp increase in funding for energy-efficien ren­\n\novation. Funds in he amoun of 16.7 billion euros for 2024 \n\nhave been earmarked in he Klima- und Transformationsfonds \n\nfor Federal Funding of Efficien Buildings.13 This represents \n\nan increase of almos 50 percen compared o he funding for \n\n2023.14 Compared o he long-term average, he subsidies are \n\n11\t Sophie M.

The increase in nominal funding is \n\noffse by higher construction and financing costs in particu­\n\nlar.
