In February 2024, the maximum length of this \n\nexclusion period was increased from 18 to 36 months. This \n\nincrease may double the actual waiting time, which is currently \n\nalready more than one year, as data from the Socio-Economic \n\nPanel show. This particularly affects refugees with a low level \n\nof education and little knowledge of German. A longer waiting \n\ntime not only negatively impacts the health of affected individ­\n\nuals but is also disadvantageous for the state; late treatment \n\noften requires more expensive treatment. Thus, shortening the \n\nperiod would have been more sensible than increasing it. The \n\nelectronic health insurance card (EHIC) for refugees makes \n\naccess to health services during this waiting period easier, as \n\nit reduces administrative barriers. However, just under 20 per­\n\ncent of all refugees have an EHIC, as the system has not been \n\nintroduced in all federal states. The electronic health insur­\n\nance card should be introduced nationwide in order to cushion \n\nthe negative effects of extended restrictions on health care.\n\nAt the end of February 2024, the maximum period that a \n\nrefugee is excluded from health care services under the \n\nAsylbewerberleistungsgesetz (Asylum Seekers’ Benefits Act, \n\nAsylbLG) was increased from 18 to 36 months. The AsylbLG \n\nregulates the amount and type of social benefits asylum seek­\n\ners receive before they are entitled to the citizen’s benefit \n\n(Bürgergeld) and other social benefits. According to calcu­\n\nlations on draft legislation by the CDU/CSU Parliamentary \n\nGroup,1 such an extension should result in savings “in the \n\nthree-digit million range annually.” This draft legislation was \n\npreceded by an agreement between the federal and state gov­\n\nernments on a series of measures to reduce incentives for \n\nrefugees to migrate to Germany as well as the costs incurred \n\nby state and local authorities, including increasing the exclu­\n\nsion period of the AsylbLG. However, the actual effects of \n\nsuch a change to the AsylbLG have not been discussed in \n\ndetail. In this Weekly Report, health care will be used as an \n\nexample to show how increasing the AsylbLG’s exclusion \n\nperiod affects the health and integration of refugees as well \n\nas the financing of health care.2 The effect of introducing the \n\nelectronic health insurance card (EHIC) for refugees in this \n\nlegal context is also explored.\n\nAsylum seekers, refugees with exceptional leave to remain \n\n(Geduldete), and refugees required to leave the country \n\n(Ausreisepflichtige) have limited healthcare entitlements com­\n\npared to social welfare recipients. By the end of February 2024, \n\nthis exclusion period lasted 18 months; until September 2019, \n\nit was only 15 months. According to Section 4 of the AsylbLG, \n\nrefugees are entitled to treatment for “acute illnesses and \n\npain,” vaccinations and medically required check-ups as \n\nwell as pregnancy and birth. Further services can be pro­\n\nvided on an individual basis according to Section 6 as long as \n\n1 \n\nDeutscher Bundestag, “Gesetzentwurf der Fraktion CDU/CSU. Entwurf eines Gesetzes zur \n\nWeiterentwicklung des Asylbewerberleistungsgesetzes (Asylbewerberleistungsweiterentwick­\n\nlungsgesetz – AsylbLWG),” Bundestags-Drucksache 20/9309 (2023) (in German; available online. \n\nAccessed on February 28, 2024. This applies to all other online sources in this report unless stated \n\notherwise).\n\n2 This Weekly Report uses the word refugees. This refers to all people who have submitted an \n\nasylum claim in Germany regardless of the result. Thus, this includes people in the middle of their \n\nasylum claim as well as people with a positive or negative (such as exceptional leave to remain or \n\na requirement to leave the country) asylum decision. Ukrainian refugees are not affected by the \n\nAsylbewerberleistungsgesetz and are thus not included in the analysis.\n\n99\n\nDIW Weekly Report 12/2024\n\nACCESS TO HEALTH CARE\n\nthey are “vital to ensuring [...] health.” With regard to health \n\ncare, the AsylbLG offers considerable scope for discretion, \n\nas neither “acute pain conditions” according to Section 4 nor \n\nthe “indispensability” of care according to Section 6 are pre­\n\ncisely defined. It is therefore up to the responsible doctors to \n\nassess the situation and the social security offices to decide \n\nwhether they will approve reimbursement.3 This results in \n\nconsiderable inequality in refugees’ realized access to health \n\ncare.4 It is clear, however, that refugees must initially expect \n\nconsiderable health care restrictions after their arrival in \n\nGermany. Refugees have the same entitlements to health \n\ncare services as social welfare recipients only after the end \n\nof the AsylbLG exclusion period5 or once their asylum claim \n\nhas been approved (SGB XII, Figure 1).\n\nThe introduction of the AsylbLG in 1993 was accompanied \n\nby a change in health care financing from the health insur­\n\nance companies to the municipalities and thus required a \n\nnew billing structure. Health care vouchers were introduced \n\nfor this purpose: Before a doctor’s appointment, a refugee \n\nmust apply for a health care voucher from the responsi­\n\nble social security office. The social security office reviews \n\nadherence to the AsylbLG as well as the medical necessity \n\nof the doctor’s appointment. This process leads to unnec­\n\nessary delays in treatment and is viewed as a barrier to care \n\n3 Amand Führer, “Determinanten der Gesundheit und medizinischen Versorgung von Asyl­\n\nsuchenden in Deutschland,” Bundesgesundheitsblatt no. 10 (2023): 1083–91 (available online).\n\n4 Oliver Razum, Judith Wenner, and Kayvan Bozorgmehr, “Wenn Zufall über den Zugang zur Ge­\n\nsundheitsversorgung bestimmt: Geflüchtete in Deutschland,” Das Gesundheitswesen, no. 11 (2016): \n\n711–714 (in German; available online).\n\n5 The exclusion period of the AsylbLG has also been the subject of reform discussions in the \n\npast and has been changed several times. Until September 2019, the period was 15 months. Be­\n\ntween 2007 and 2015 it was 48 months, between 1997 and 2007 it was 36 months, and between \n\n1993 and 1997 it was 12 months.\n\nby patients and doctors.6 In addition to the considerable \n\namount of administrative work required, medical laypeo­\n\nple are acting as gatekeepers to the health care system.7 An \n\nalternative system using an electronic health insurance card \n\n(EHIC) was introduced in Bremen for the first time in 2005 \n\n(Box 1). Currently, the EHIC has been introduced comprehen­\n\nsively in six states: Berlin, Brandenburg, Bremen, Hamburg, \n\nThuringia, and Schleswig-Holstein. The EHIC has also been \n\nintroduced in individual districts and municipalities in three \n\nother states (Figure 2).\n\nThe 2019 change to the AsylbLG’s exclusion period and the \n\ngradual introduction of the EHIC since 2005 have resulted \n\nin differing health care entitlements for refugees depending \n\non the place of residence and year. In addition, the entitle­\n\nments depend on the processing time of the asylum claim, \n\nwhich has varied over the past years and by the applicant’s \n\ncountry of origin. The number of refugees with exceptional \n\nleave to remain also plays a role, as they are subject to the \n\nAsylbLG regulations even after their asylum process has \n\nbeen completed.8 Due to these circumstances, it is currently \n\nunclear how long refugees actually had to wait for full health \n\ncare entitlements.\n\nTo assess the consequences of extending the exclusion period \n\nto 36 months, we must look at how many refugees are actually \n\naffected by such an extension. That is, how many individuals \n\n6 Anke Spura et al., “Wie erleben Asylsuchende den Zugang zu medizinischer Versorgung?” \n\nBundesgesundheitsblatt 60 (2017): 462–470 (in German; available online).\n\n7 Führer, “Determinanten der Gesundheit und medizinischen Versorgung von Asylsuchenden in \n\nDeutschland.”\n\n8 Many refugees whose asylum claim is rejected are granted an exceptional leave to remain, as \n\nreturning to their home country is not possible for various reasons. In recent years, the share of \n\npeople whose asylum claim has been rejected who have been given exceptional leave to remain \n\nhas consistently been around 80 percent.

Furthermore, it is unclear who is affected \n\nby long waiting times: The length of the asylum process var­\n\nies depending on the applicant’s country of origin, meaning \n\nthat the actual waiting time for regular health care entitle­\n\nments can vary greatly for certain groups of refugees. The \n\nburden of disease, especially for chronic illnesses, is higher \n\namong older refugees, women, or refugees with a low level \n\nof education and these groups thus have a higher need for \n\nhealth services.9 If these groups experience very long wait­\n\ning times, they experience a double hardship: Not only are \n\nthey ill more often and more acutely, but they also experi­\n\nence additional barriers in accessing the health care system.\n\nSome states have introduced the EHIC for refugees to sim­\n\nplify administrative access to health care during the AsylbLG \n\nexclusion period. However, it is currently unclear who the \n\nEHIC benefits. The waiting times for different groups of \n\n9 Louise Biddle et al., “Health monitoring among asylum seekers and refugees: a state­wide, \n\ncross­sectional, population­based study in Germany,” Emerging Themes in Epidemiology 16, no. \n\n3 (2019) (available online); Jan Michael Bauer, Tilman Brand, and Hajo Zeeb, “Pre­migration soci­\n\noeconomic status and post­migration health satisfaction among Syrian refugees in Germany: A \n\ncross­sectional analysis,” PLoS Med 17 (2020) (available online).\n\nFigure 2\n\nCoverage of the electronic health insurance card (EHIC) for \n\nrefugees in Germany\n\n \n\nSource: Information portal of Medibüro/Medinetze (as of February 2024).\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nThe electronic health insurance card has been introduced comprehensively in six \n\nfederal states, while it has been partially introduced in three other states.\n\nBox 1\n\nElectronic health insurance card for refugees\n\nThe electronic health insurance card for refugees makes it \n\npossible for refugees to use health care services legally with­\n\nout a health care voucher. Refugees receive a chip card that \n\nthey can use to receive health care services directly in the \n\nsame way as the statutorily insured via a framework agree­\n\nment between state authorities and a health insurance pro­\n\nvider. To this end, a range of services is defined in advance at \n\nstate level that complies with the AsylbLG.1 The costs of med­\n\nical care are covered by the municipality, but the services are \n\ncheaper, as the municipalities now are subject to the health \n\ninsurance providers’ cost catalog.2 The health care companies \n\nreceive an administrative fee per chip card for their efforts; \n\nthis is ten euros per month per person in Hamburg, for exam­\n\nple.3 The EHIC makes access to health care easier by remov­\n\ning bureaucratic obstacles for both patients and doctors, by \n\ncreating clarity about the scope of health care services, and \n\nby minimizing waiting times associated with the health care \n\nvoucher system.\n\nIn addition to the benefits for the municipalities, the introduc­\n\ntion of the EHIC has significant benefits for the general health \n\nstatus and mental health of refugees.4 These benefits are espe­\n\ncially evident for refugees with language barriers.5 In addition, \n\nthe introduction of the EHIC results in higher utilization of pri­\n\nmary care6 while lowering utilization of emergency care.7\n\n1 \n\nIn practice, negotiating a benefits catalog with the health insurance providers often \n\nmeans that the restrictions of the AsylbLG are less severe in regions with the EHIC and, with \n\na few exceptions, correspond to the benefits catalog of the statutory health insurance com­\n\npanies, see Marcel Wächter­Raquet, Einführung der Gesundheitskarte für Asylsuchende und \n\nFlüchtlinge.

Sixty-four percent of the refugees had to wait for \n\nthe end of the AsylbLG exclusion period,10 whereas 36 percent \n\nwere granted regular entitlements earlier due to their asylum \n\nclaim being accepted. Thus, the majority of refugees experi­\n\nence a long exclusion period under the AsylbLG (Figure 3).\n\nThere are slight but statistically significant differences \n\nbetween men and women in the waiting period until full \n\nhealth care entitlements. On average, women had to wait \n\n17 days longer than men (Figure 4). Refugees with a low \n\n10 At this time: 15 or 18 months.\n\nlevel of education also had to wait longer: On average, they \n\nwaited 24 days longer than refugees with a medium level \n\nof education.\n\n36-month exclusion period likely to increase \n\ndisadvantages for refugees with a low level of \n\neducation and little knowledge of German\n\nIf refugees who were living in Germany in 2021 had had a \n\nwaiting time of 36 months instead of 18 (or 15), they would \n\nhave waited an additional 352 days on average before receiv­\n\ning regular health care entitlements. Fifty-two percent of the \n\nrefugees would have had to wait for the end of the AsylbLG’s \n\nexclusion period—so 36 months—whereas 48 percent would \n\nhave received earlier access due to their asylum claim being \n\naccepted.\n\nA hypothetical validity period of 36 months greatly  exacerbates \n\nthe differences in waiting times: Refugees with a low level of \n\neducation would have to wait around three months longer \n\nthan refugees with an intermediate or high level of educa­\n\ntion (Figure 5). Refugees with little or intermediate knowl­\n\nedge of German would have also had to wait around two \n\nmonths longer than refugees who understand German well.\n\nFigure 3\n\nEntitlements to health care system by months after arrival\n\nIn percent of all refugees\n\n \n\nNote: Refugees who came to Germany between 2013 and 2020.

The gradual introduc­\n\ntion of the EHIC since 2005 has resulted in easier access to \n\nhealth care services for a total of 17 percent of all refugees. \n\nSeven percent of refugees had full access to the health care \n\nsystem at the point of introduction and could thus not ben­\n\nefit from the EHIC although they lived in a region where it \n\nwas in use (Figure 6). Thus, so far only very few refugees \n\nor municipalities have been able to benefit from the intro­\n\nduction of the EHIC (Box 1). The majority of refugees must \n\nface the uncertainty, extra effort, and treatment delays asso­\n\nciated with the health care voucher system.\n\nIn addition, regional coverage of the EHIC is associated \n\nwith inequality in regard to the refugees’ level of education: \n\nThirty-four percent of refugees with a high level of educa­\n\ntion live in a region with the EHIC. However, only 22 and \n\n23 percent of refugees with an intermediate or low level of \n\neducation, respectively (Figure 6), live in a region with the \n\nEHIC. Like the maximum exclusion period of the AsylbLG, \n\nthe administrative regulations in the states result in a sys­\n\ntematic health disadvantage for refugees with a low level of \n\neducation, although this group generally has a higher bur­\n\nden of disease and already faces greater obstacles in access­\n\ning health care services.\n\nLonger exclusion period from healthcare \n\nentitlements: Hope for cost savings is short \n\nsighted\n\nThe actual waiting time until regular health care entitle­\n\nments is already significant and will more than double by \n\nexpanding the AsylbLG exclusion period to 36 months. It is \n\nshort-sighted to assume that limiting health care services \n\nwill save money. In contrast, studies show that limiting ref­\n\nugees’ health care is more cost-intensive in the long run.11 \n\nThis is because limiting health care access increased the \n\nchance that emergency or intensive treatment is required. \n\nEarly intervention in primary care, on the other hand, can \n\nprevent expensive hospital stays, complex diagnostic proce­\n\ndures, and serious disease progression.12\n\nThe argument of cost savings is also short-sighted, as it \n\nignores the consequences of poor health on refugees’ social \n\nand economic participation. It is well documented that seri­\n\nous illness restricts a person’s ability to participate in educa­\n\ntional opportunities, find and keep a job, take care of their \n\nfamily, and participate in social activities.13 Not addressing \n\n11 Kayvan Bozorgmehr and Oliver Razum, “Effect of Restricting Access to Health Care on Health \n\nExpenditures among Asylum­Seekers and Refugees: A Quasi­Experimental Study in Germany, \n\n1994–2013,” PLoS ONE 10 (2015): (available online).\n\n12 Aldo Rosano et al., “The relationship between avoidable hospitalization and accessibility to \n\nprimary care: a systematic review,” European Journal of Public Health (2013): 356–360 (available \n\nonline).\n\n13 Maria K.

The data analysis methodol­\n\nogy is a means comparison of the waiting times 1) under current \n\nconditions, and 2) under a hypothetical expansion of the AsylbLG’s \n\nexclusion period to 36 months within and between groups with \n\n95-percent confidence intervals. The coverage of the electronic \n\nhealth insurance card is calculated as a proportion of all refugees.\n\nTo calculate the waiting time until regular health care entitlements \n\nunder the current conditions (as of January 2024), two pieces of \n\ninformation are linked: the time since arrival in Germany and the \n\ndate of approval of the asylum claim. If the approval occurred dur­\n\ning the exclusion period of the AsylbLG (15 months or 18 months \n\nafter September 21, 2019), time to approval was considered as the \n\nwaiting time until regular entitlements. Otherwise, the exclusion \n\nperiod of the AsylbLG was used. If no information about the date \n\nof arrival in Germany was available, the date of the asylum claim \n\nis used. Individuals who have not yet received a decision on their \n\nasylum claim at the time of the survey and were still subject to the \n\nexclusion period of the AsylbLG, and for whom the final waiting \n\ntime was thus unclear, are excluded from the analysis. Overall, \n\n2,181 refugees who participated in the 2021 survey are included in \n\nthe analysis.\n\nData on the date of arrival and the asylum claim are available for \n\nthe respective month and year. For this analysis, however, days \n\nare used as the measure by using the midpoint of each month \n\n(the 15th day). It is assumed that the arrival of refugees is evenly \n\ndistributed over the month, so a correct average number of days \n\nis calculated with a sufficiently large sample size. An advantage to \n\nusing days instead of months is that distortions can be avoided if \n\nthis information is linked with legislative changes, as these often \n\nhappen at the beginning of a month.\n\nIn order to evaluate the waiting time under a hypothetical ex­\n\npansion of the exclusion period of the AsylbLG to 36 months, \n\ndata on the date of arrival in Germany and the date the asylum \n\nclaim was approved are similarly linked. However, in this case, a \n\nwaiting time of 36 months is determined if the asylum claim was \n\nnot approved within the first 36 months.

For this hypothetical scenario, 2,152 \n\nrefugees who participated in the 2021 survey are included in the \n\nanalysis.\n\nRegional data from SOEP is used to evaluate the coverage of the \n\nelectronic health insurance card. These are linked with the date of \n\nintroduction in the respective federal states, counties, or munic­\n\nipalities.3 A survey respondent could benefit from the electronic \n\nhealth insurance card if they lived in a region with the EHIC and \n\nits introduction happened before they received regular access to \n\nthe health care system (before the expiry of the AsylbLG exclusion \n\nperiod or the asylum claim).\n\nTo investigate inequalities in regard to people with a special need \n\nfor health care, the calculated waiting time and EHIC coverage are \n\nconsidered separately according to four characteristics: gender \n\n(male/female), age group (17–29/30–49/50+), level of education \n\nin home country based on the ISCED-11 classification (low/medi­\n\num/high), and German language skills, with speaking, writing and \n\nreading skills each recorded on a scale of 1-5, summed, and then \n\ntertiles of the total score formed (low/medium/high).\n\nCross-sectional weights are used for the analyses so that the \n\nresults are representative for refugees living in Germany in 2021 \n\n(excluding Ukrainian refugees, as the AsylbLG does not apply to \n\nthem). \n\n3 For more on this process, cf. Philipp Jaschke and Yuliya Kosyakova, “Does Facilitated and Ear­\n\nly Access to the Healthcare System Improve Refugees’ Health Outcomes?” Evidence from a Natu­\n\nral Experiment in Germany,” International Migration Review 55 (2021): 812–842 (available online). \n\n104\n\nDIW Weekly Report 12/2024\n\nACCESS TO HEALTH CARE\n\nhealth problems at an early stage with needs-based care can \n\nresult in significant, long-term social and economic costs for \n\nthe federal government and the social systems.\n\nThus, the savings cited in the CDU/CSU Parliamentary \n\nGroup’s draft legislation cannot be scientifically justified \n\nin regard to health care. Moreover, the presumption that \n\nincreasing the exclusion period of the AsylbLG will make \n\nGermany a less attractive destination and that the number \n\nof asylum seekers will decline is not scientifically ground­\n\ned.14 In the context of forced migration, it is predominantly \n\nthe conditions and events in the origin country that deter­\n\nmine if asylum figures rise or fall, while more or less restric­\n\ntive laws in destination countries play a less important role.15\n\nFurthermore, increasing the exclusion period of the AsylbLG \n\nparticularly affects refugees with a low level of education and \n\nlittle knowledge of German. However, these are the refugees \n\nthat have the highest disease burden and thus require swift, \n\nappropriate care.16\n\n14 Wissenschaftlicher Dienst des Deutschen Bundestags, Push- und Pull-Faktoren in der \n\n Migrationsforschung (2020) (in German; available online).\n\n15 T.J.

This is a clear \n\nviolation of the right to health, to which Germany has com­\n\nmitted itself by ratifying the UN International Covenant on \n\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights.17 The restrictions are \n\noften justified by their temporary nature, but the long pro­\n\ncessing time of asylum claims in Germany, the high asylum \n\nclaim acceptance rate, and the high share of refugees with \n\nexceptional leave to remain mean that the restrictions affect \n\nthe people who remain in Germany for long periods of time.\n\nMoreover, the health care restrictions result in negative \n\nhealth outcomes for refugees in the short-term, as well as \n\nincurring long-term costs for the state if delayed treatment \n\nresults in high costs for emergency or intensive care. Instead \n\nof creating additional legal barriers for refugees, access to \n\nthe health care system should be made easier, for example \n\nthrough low-threshold health care provision in refugee shel­\n\nters,18 the nationwide introduction of the EHIC to remove \n\nadministrative barriers,19 and appropriate interpretation and \n\ntranslation services.20\n\nThe introduction of the EHIC for refugees offers significant \n\nhealth and economic benefits, but is insufficiently imple­\n\nmented. By removing administrative barriers related to the \n\nhealth care voucher, health care services can be accessed ear­\n\nlier instead of delaying treatment. Arguments against the \n\nintroduction of the EHIC are the relatively high adminis­\n\ntration fees charged by health insurance companies and the \n\nfeared increase in health care costs. However, administrative \n\ncosts of 1.6 million euros were saved annually in Hamburg \n\nusing the EHIC compared to the health care voucher sys­\n\ntem.21 Furthermore, easier access to health care via the EHIC \n\ndid not lead to inappropriate use: In the Ruhr area, for exam­\n\nple, the number of doctor’s visits increased following the \n\nintroduction of the EHIC, but was still lower than among \n\nnon-refugees.22 Thus, primary health care costs may rise in \n\nthe short term depending on health needs.23 However, this \n\n17 Kayvan Bozorgmehr, Judith Wenner, and Oliver Razum, “Restricted access to health care for \n\nasylum­seekers: applying a human rights lens to the argument of resource constraints,” European \n\nJournal of Public Health 27 (2017): 592–593 (available online).\n\n18 Katharina Wahedi et al., “Medizinische Versorgung von Asylsuchenden in Erstaufnahme­\n\neinrichtungen,” Bundesgesundheitsblatt 63 (2020): 1460–1469 (in German; available online).\n\n19 Führer, “Determinanten der Gesundheit und medizinischen Versorgung von Asylsuchenden in \n\nDeutschland.”\n\n20 Amand Führer and Patrick Brzoska, “Die Relevanz des Dolmetschens im Gesundheitssystem,“ \n\nGesundheitswesen (2022): 474–478 (in German; available online).\n\n21 Frank Burmester, Auswirkungen der Zusammenarbeit mit der AOK Bremen / Bremerhaven aus \n\nSicht der Behörde für Arbeit, Soziales, Familie und Integration.

In February 2024, he maximum length of his \n\nexclusion period was increased from 18 o 36 months. This \n\nincrease may double he actual waiting ime, which is currently \n\nalready more han one year, as data from he Socio-Economic \n\nPanel show. This particularly affects refugees with a low level \n\nof education and li le knowledge of German. A longer waiting \n\ntime no only negatively impacts he health of affected individ­\n\nuals bu is also disadvantageous for he state; late reatmen \n\noften requires more expensive reatment. Thus, shortening he \n\nperiod would have been more sensible han increasing it. The \n\nelectronic health insurance card (EHIC) for refugees makes \n\naccess o health services during his waiting period easier, as \n\ni reduces administrative barriers. However, jus under 20 per­\n\ncen of all refugees have an EHIC, as he system has no been \n\nintroduced in all federal states. The electronic health insur­\n\nance card should be introduced nationwide in order o cushion \n\nthe negative effects of extended restrictions on health care.\n\nA he end of February 2024, he maximum period ha a \n\nrefugee is excluded from health care services under he \n\nAsylbewerberleistungsgesetz (Asylum Seekers’ Benefits Act, \n\nAsylbLG) was increased from 18 o 36 months. The AsylbLG \n\nregulates he amoun and ype of social benefits asylum seek­\n\ners receive before hey are entitled o he citizen’s benefi \n\n(Bürgergeld) and other social benefits. According o calcu­\n\nlations on draf legislation by he CDU/CSU Parliamentary \n\nGroup,1 such an extension should resul in savings “in he \n\nthree-digi million range annually.” This draf legislation was \n\npreceded by an agreemen between he federal and state gov­\n\nernments on a series of measures o reduce incentives for \n\nrefugees o migrate o Germany as well as he costs incurred \n\nby state and local authorities, including increasing he exclu­\n\nsion period of he AsylbLG. However, he actual effects of \n\nsuch a change o he AsylbLG have no been discussed in \n\ndetail. In his Weekly Report, health care will be used as an \n\nexample o show how increasing he AsylbLG’s exclusion \n\nperiod affects he health and integration of refugees as well \n\nas he financing of health care.2 The effec of introducing he \n\nelectronic health insurance card (EHIC) for refugees in his \n\nlegal contex is also explored.\n\nAsylum seekers, refugees with exceptional leave o remain \n\n(Geduldete), and refugees required o leave he country \n\n(Ausreisepflichtige) have limited healthcare entitlements com­\n\npared o social welfare recipients. By he end of February 2024, \n\nthis exclusion period lasted 18 months; until September 2019, \n\ni was only 15 months. According o Section 4 of he AsylbLG, \n\nrefugees are entitled o reatmen for “acute illnesses and \n\npain,” vaccinations and medically required check-ups as \n\nwell as pregnancy and birth. Further services can be pro­\n\nvided on an individual basis according o Section 6 as long as \n\n1 \n\nDeutscher Bundestag, “Gesetzentwurf der Fraktion CDU/CSU.

This applies o all other online sources in his repor unless stated \n\notherwise).\n\n2 This Weekly Repor uses he word refugees. This refers o all people who have submi ed an \n\nasylum claim in Germany regardless of he result. Thus, his includes people in he middle of heir \n\nasylum claim as well as people with a positive or negative (such as exceptional leave o remain or \n\na requiremen o leave he country) asylum decision. Ukrainian refugees are no affected by he \n\nAsylbewerberleistungsgesetz and are hus no included in he analysis.\n\n99\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 12/2024\n\nACCESS TO HEALTH CARE\n\nthey are “vital o ensuring [...] health.” With regard o health \n\ncare, he AsylbLG offers considerable scope for discretion, \n\nas neither “acute pain conditions” according o Section 4 nor \n\nthe “indispensability” of care according o Section 6 are pre­\n\ncisely defined. I is herefore up o he responsible doctors o \n\nassess he situation and he social security offices o decide \n\nwhether hey will approve reimbursement.3 This results in \n\nconsiderable inequality in refugees’ realized access o health \n\ncare.4 I is clear, however, ha refugees mus initially expec \n\nconsiderable health care restrictions after heir arrival in \n\nGermany. Refugees have he same entitlements o health \n\ncare services as social welfare recipients only after he end \n\nof he AsylbLG exclusion period5 or once heir asylum claim \n\nhas been approved (SGB XII, Figure 1).\n\nThe introduction of he AsylbLG in 1993 was accompanied \n\nby a change in health care financing from he health insur­\n\nance companies o he municipalities and hus required a \n\nnew billing structure. Health care vouchers were introduced \n\nfor his purpose: Before a doctor’s appointment, a refugee \n\nmus apply for a health care voucher from he responsi­\n\nble social security office. The social security office reviews \n\nadherence o he AsylbLG as well as he medical necessity \n\nof he doctor’s appointment. This process leads o unnec­\n\nessary delays in reatmen and is viewed as a barrier o care \n\n3 Amand Führer, “Determinanten der Gesundhei und medizinischen Versorgung von Asyl­\n\nsuchenden in Deutschland,” Bundesgesundheitsbla no. 10 (2023): 1083–91 (available online).\n\n4 Oliver Razum, Judith Wenner, and Kayvan Bozorgmehr, “Wenn Zufall über den Zugang zur Ge­\n\nsundheitsversorgung bestimmt: Geflüchtete in Deutschland,” Das Gesundheitswesen, no. 11 (2016): \n\n711–714 (in German; available online).\n\n5 The exclusion period of he AsylbLG has also been he subjec of reform discussions in he \n\npas and has been changed several imes. Until September 2019, he period was 15 months. Be­\n\ntween 2007 and 2015 i was 48 months, between 1997 and 2007 i was 36 months, and between \n\n1993 and 1997 i was 12 months.\n\nby patients and doctors.6 In addition o he considerable \n\namoun of administrative work required, medical laypeo­\n\nple are acting as gatekeepers o he health care system.7 An \n\nalternative system using an electronic health insurance card \n\n(EHIC) was introduced in Bremen for he firs ime in 2005 \n\n(Box 1). Currently, he EHIC has been introduced comprehen­\n\nsively in six states: Berlin, Brandenburg, Bremen, Hamburg, \n\nThuringia, and Schleswig-Holstein. The EHIC has also been \n\nintroduced in individual districts and municipalities in hree \n\nother states (Figure 2).\n\nThe 2019 change o he AsylbLG’s exclusion period and he \n\ngradual introduction of he EHIC since 2005 have resulted \n\nin differing health care entitlements for refugees depending \n\non he place of residence and year. In addition, he entitle­\n\nments depend on he processing ime of he asylum claim, \n\nwhich has varied over he pas years and by he applicant’s \n\ncountry of origin. The number of refugees with exceptional \n\nleave o remain also plays a role, as hey are subjec o he \n\nAsylbLG regulations even after heir asylum process has \n\nbeen completed.8 Due o hese circumstances, i is currently \n\nunclear how long refugees actually had o wai for full health \n\ncare entitlements.\n\nTo assess he consequences of extending he exclusion period \n\nto 36 months, we mus look a how many refugees are actually \n\naffected by such an extension. Tha is, how many individuals \n\n6 Anke Spura e al., “Wie erleben Asylsuchende den Zugang zu medizinischer Versorgung?” \n\nBundesgesundheitsbla 60 (2017): 462–470 (in German; available online).\n\n7 Führer, “Determinanten der Gesundhei und medizinischen Versorgung von Asylsuchenden in \n\nDeutschland.”\n\n8 Many refugees whose asylum claim is rejected are granted an exceptional leave o remain, as \n\nreturning o heir home country is no possible for various reasons. In recen years, he share of \n\npeople whose asylum claim has been rejected who have been given exceptional leave o remain \n\nhas consistently been around 80 percent.

The gradual introduc­\n\ntion of he EHIC since 2005 has resulted in easier access o \n\nhealth care services for a otal of 17 percen of all refugees. \n\nSeven percen of refugees had full access o he health care \n\nsystem a he poin of introduction and could hus no ben­\n\nefi from he EHIC although hey lived in a region where i \n\nwas in use (Figure 6). Thus, so far only very few refugees \n\nor municipalities have been able o benefi from he intro­\n\nduction of he EHIC (Box 1). The majority of refugees mus \n\nface he uncertainty, extra effort, and reatmen delays asso­\n\nciated with he health care voucher system.\n\nIn addition, regional coverage of he EHIC is associated \n\nwith inequality in regard o he refugees’ level of education: \n\nThirty-four percen of refugees with a high level of educa­\n\ntion live in a region with he EHIC. However, only 22 and \n\n23 percen of refugees with an intermediate or low level of \n\neducation, respectively (Figure 6), live in a region with he \n\nEHIC. Like he maximum exclusion period of he AsylbLG, \n\nthe administrative regulations in he states resul in a sys­\n\ntematic health disadvantage for refugees with a low level of \n\neducation, although his group generally has a higher bur­\n\nden of disease and already faces greater obstacles in access­\n\ning health care services.\n\nLonger exclusion period from healthcare \n\nentitlements: Hope for cos savings is shor \n\nsighted\n\nThe actual waiting ime until regular health care entitle­\n\nments is already significan and will more han double by \n\nexpanding he AsylbLG exclusion period o 36 months. I is \n\nshort-sighted o assume ha limiting health care services \n\nwill save money. In contrast, studies show ha limiting ref­\n\nugees’ health care is more cost-intensive in he long run.11 \n\nThis is because limiting health care access increased he \n\nchance ha emergency or intensive reatmen is required. \n\nEarly intervention in primary care, on he other hand, can \n\npreven expensive hospital stays, complex diagnostic proce­\n\ndures, and serious disease progression.12\n\nThe argumen of cos savings is also short-sighted, as i \n\nignores he consequences of poor health on refugees’ social \n\nand economic participation. I is well documented ha seri­\n\nous illness restricts a person’s ability o participate in educa­\n\ntional opportunities, find and keep a job, ake care of heir \n\nfamily, and participate in social activities.13 No addressing \n\n11 Kayvan Bozorgmehr and Oliver Razum, “Effec of Restricting Access o Health Care on Health \n\nExpenditures among Asylum­Seekers and Refugees: A Quasi­Experimental Study in Germany, \n\n1994–2013,” PLoS ONE 10 (2015): (available online).\n\n12 Aldo Rosano e al., “The relationship between avoidable hospitalization and accessibility o \n\nprimary care: a systematic review,” European Journal of Public Health (2013): 356–360 (available \n\nonline).\n\n13 Maria K.

The data analysis methodol­\n\nogy is a means comparison of he waiting imes 1) under curren \n\nconditions, and 2) under a hypothetical expansion of he AsylbLG’s \n\nexclusion period o 36 months within and between groups with \n\n95-percen confidence intervals. The coverage of he electronic \n\nhealth insurance card is calculated as a proportion of all refugees.\n\nTo calculate he waiting ime until regular health care entitlements \n\nunder he curren conditions (as of January 2024), wo pieces of \n\ninformation are linked: he ime since arrival in Germany and he \n\ndate of approval of he asylum claim. If he approval occurred dur­\n\ning he exclusion period of he AsylbLG (15 months or 18 months \n\nafter September 21, 2019), ime o approval was considered as he \n\nwaiting ime until regular entitlements. Otherwise, he exclusion \n\nperiod of he AsylbLG was used. If no information abou he date \n\nof arrival in Germany was available, he date of he asylum claim \n\nis used. Individuals who have no ye received a decision on heir \n\nasylum claim a he ime of he survey and were still subjec o he \n\nexclusion period of he AsylbLG, and for whom he final waiting \n\ntime was hus unclear, are excluded from he analysis. Overall, \n\n2,181 refugees who participated in he 2021 survey are included in \n\nthe analysis.\n\nData on he date of arrival and he asylum claim are available for \n\nthe respective month and year. For his analysis, however, days \n\nare used as he measure by using he midpoin of each month \n\n(the 15th day). I is assumed ha he arrival of refugees is evenly \n\ndistributed over he month, so a correc average number of days \n\nis calculated with a sufficiently large sample size. An advantage o \n\nusing days instead of months is ha distortions can be avoided if \n\nthis information is linked with legislative changes, as hese often \n\nhappen a he beginning of a month.\n\nIn order o evaluate he waiting ime under a hypothetical ex­\n\npansion of he exclusion period of he AsylbLG o 36 months, \n\ndata on he date of arrival in Germany and he date he asylum \n\nclaim was approved are similarly linked. However, in his case, a \n\nwaiting ime of 36 months is determined if he asylum claim was \n\nno approved within he firs 36 months. Otherwise, he ime until \n\napproval is considered as he waiting ime.

Moreover, he presumption ha \n\nincreasing he exclusion period of he AsylbLG will make \n\nGermany a less a ractive destination and ha he number \n\nof asylum seekers will decline is no scientifically ground­\n\ned.14 In he contex of forced migration, i is predominantly \n\nthe conditions and events in he origin country ha deter­\n\nmine if asylum figures rise or fall, while more or less restric­\n\ntive laws in destination countries play a less importan role.15\n\nFurthermore, increasing he exclusion period of he AsylbLG \n\nparticularly affects refugees with a low level of education and \n\nli le knowledge of German.

This is a clear \n\nviolation of he righ o health, o which Germany has com­\n\nmi ed itself by ratifying he UN International Covenan on \n\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights.17 The restrictions are \n\noften justified by heir emporary nature, bu he long pro­\n\ncessing ime of asylum claims in Germany, he high asylum \n\nclaim acceptance rate, and he high share of refugees with \n\nexceptional leave o remain mean ha he restrictions affec \n\nthe people who remain in Germany for long periods of ime.\n\nMoreover, he health care restrictions resul in negative \n\nhealth outcomes for refugees in he short-term, as well as \n\nincurring long-term costs for he state if delayed reatmen \n\nresults in high costs for emergency or intensive care. Instead \n\nof creating additional legal barriers for refugees, access o \n\nthe health care system should be made easier, for example \n\nthrough low-threshold health care provision in refugee shel­\n\nters,18 he nationwide introduction of he EHIC o remove \n\nadministrative barriers,19 and appropriate interpretation and \n\ntranslation services.20\n\nThe introduction of he EHIC for refugees offers significan \n\nhealth and economic benefits, bu is insufficiently imple­\n\nmented. By removing administrative barriers related o he \n\nhealth care voucher, health care services can be accessed ear­\n\nlier instead of delaying reatment. Arguments agains he \n\nintroduction of he EHIC are he relatively high adminis­\n\ntration fees charged by health insurance companies and he \n\nfeared increase in health care costs. However, administrative \n\ncosts of 1.6 million euros were saved annually in Hamburg \n\nusing he EHIC compared o he health care voucher sys­\n\ntem.21 Furthermore, easier access o health care via he EHIC \n\ndid no lead o inappropriate use: In he Ruhr area, for exam­\n\nple, he number of doctor’s visits increased following he \n\nintroduction of he EHIC, bu was still lower han among \n\nnon-refugees.22 Thus, primary health care costs may rise in \n\nthe shor erm depending on health needs.23 However, his \n\n17 Kayvan Bozorgmehr, Judith Wenner, and Oliver Razum, “Restricted access o health care for \n\nasylum­seekers: applying a human rights lens o he argumen of resource constraints,” European \n\nJournal of Public Health 27 (2017): 592–593 (available online).\n\n18 Katharina Wahedi e al., “Medizinische Versorgung von Asylsuchenden in Erstaufnahme­\n\neinrichtungen,” Bundesgesundheitsbla 63 (2020): 1460–1469 (in German; available online).\n\n19 Führer, “Determinanten der Gesundhei und medizinischen Versorgung von Asylsuchenden in \n\nDeutschland.”\n\n20 Amand Führer and Patrick Brzoska, “Die Relevanz des Dolmetschens im Gesundheitssystem,“ \n\nGesundheitswesen (2022): 474–478 (in German; available online).\n\n21 Frank Burmester, Auswirkungen der Zusammenarbei mi der AOK Bremen / Bremerhaven aus \n\nSich der Behörde für Arbeit, Soziales, Familie und Integration.
