In 2023, around 72 billion euros were spen on the energy-efficien renovation of residential, public, and com­ mercial buildings, abou 12 billion more han in 2021. Never­ theless, investments declined by over six percen in price-ad­ justed erms, as construction prices rose sharply during his time as well. To reach climate argets, however, significantly more real investments in energy-efficien building renova­ tion are needed, as are framework conditions in Germany and Europe. Investmen aid for energy-efficien renovation measures also plays an importan role. The German Federal Governmen increased funding for hese measures for 2024 o 16.7 billion euros. However, policymakers will need o provide even more funding in he future due o rising financing and construction costs if hey actually wan o increase he rate of energy-efficien building renovation. In its mos recen report, he Council of Experts on Climate Change warned ha much more progress needs o happen in he building sector han has occurred o date o reach he greenhouse gas reduction argets in Germany.1 Reducing heating energy consumption in he building stock is one way o significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For over a decade, here have been calls o improve he energy condition of he building stock by increasing building enve­ lope insulation (walls, windows, roof) and installing more efficien heating systems.2 Energy-efficien renovation is difficul o measure, bu here are suitable indicators I is difficul o evaluate he exten o which energy-efficien renovation measures have actually improved he energy con­ dition of he building stock over he pas years. Detailed stud­ ies on his opic are extremely complex and only available for specific years.3 Studies based on smaller samples can only determine rough rends in he developmen of energy-effi­ cien building renovation over a few years. Moreover, hey are limited o he existing residential building stock. According to he available data, he annual energy-efficien renovation rate, which is he share of a building’s surface area ha has undergone energy-efficien renovation in a certain year, has hardly changed since 2000 and is estimated o be less han one percen for 2017.4 An alternative approach for measuring energy-efficien ren­ ovation is based on he amoun of money invested in his type of renovation instead of focusing on physical indicators. 1 Exper Council on Climate Change, Review of Projection Data: Compliance with climate arge for 2021 o 2030 no confirmed.

However, i is no possible o determine he specific additional amoun spen on improving energy efficiency ha results, for exam­ ple, from installing a riple-glazed window compared o a double-glazed one. Nevertheless, i is possible o determine Box Determining investments in energy-efficien building renovation Investments in energy-efficien building renovation are estimat­ ed by combining aggregate statistical official evaluations from the DIW Construction Volume ha have been broken down with extrapolated survey results from he construction service pro­ vider Heinze GmbH’s Modernization Volume (Figure). The DIW Construction Volume contains he otal of all services ha are involved in he construction or maintenance of buildings and structures. In his respect, he Construction Volume goes beyond the construction investmen figures of he Federal Statistical Office because heir figures do no ake into accoun consumable con­ struction services, which are primarily repairs ha do no increase in value (i.e., maintenance services provided by he main construc­ tion and finishing rades). Unlike in he official statistics, he DIW Construction Volume differentiates between construction services on he existing building stock and on new buildings. Existing measures, or rather he volume of existing construction measures, are estimated from a macro perspective by looking a the differences between otal construction outpu according o construction statistics and new construction outpu derived from construction activity statistics.1 This has he advantage of allowing consisten comparisons over ime. However, he model calcula­ tions using he difference approach lack structural information. To identify such structural information, he results from he model calculations based on official statistics are considered. These are then compared with extrapolations of modernization volumes based on surveys. The extrapolation results are based on spe­ cial analyses on he years 2014, 2018, 2020, and 2022 by Heinze GmbH.2 In Heinze GmbH’s studies, he modernization volume is calculated by linking secondary statistical marke data with survey results from arge groups relevan o he modernization market. The main source of housing marke data is a survey of representatively selected enan and owner households. In addition, commercial housing developers are surveyed. The results for non-residen­ tial construction are based on evaluations of questionnaires on modernization measures run by architects. In addition, surveys of tradespeople are used. Using hese sources, he existing meas­ ures can be differentiated by sector.

Structural information on he importance of he above sectors from a micro approach is consistently integrated into DIW construction volume calculation. A prerequisite for his is ha he results of the wo methods correspond with each other. This applies o he quantitative otal resul as well as he specific definition of con­ struction services. Thus, investmen construction services are he focus of he Heinze GmbH survey results. Due o its connection o the architec survey, his applies o non-residential construction especially. In he case of residential construction, on he other hand, work performed by he occupant, including neighborhood assistance and undeclared work, is no valued, unlike in he Construction Volume. The structural information gleaned from he Heinze GmbH surveys is herefore no directly related o he Construction Volume as a whole, bu only o he investmen part. A model calculation o sep­ arate construction services into investmen and non-investmen measures is required o integrate he values from he structural information from Heinze. For his purpose, DIW Berlin specifically evaluated he structural information on repair measures from he Heinze surveys and made corresponding extrapolations for he average maintenance measures. The measures were differentiated over ime by linking hem o he developmen of gross fixed assets in structural engineering, for which DIW Berlin developed special model calculations.3 3 Susanne Hotze et al., “Struktur der Bestandsinvestitionen 2014.

These gross costs are much higher han the additional spending specifically related o energy-effi­ cien renovation. Previous studies on residential construction sugges ha he investmen costs are wice as high as he specific additional spending.5 The otal amoun invested in energy-efficien building ren­ ovation is estimated by breaking down aggregate statistical official evaluations ha are a par of he DIW Construction Volume and by extrapolating survey results from he Modernization Volume of he construction service provider Heinze GmbH (Box). The Federal Institute for Research on Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial Developmen (Bundesinstitu für Bau-, Stadt- und Raumforschung, BBSR6) and he Federal Environmen Agency (Umweltbundesamt, UBA7) regularly publish hese results, which are based on he DIW Construction Volume and he Heinze Modernization Volume, on he investmen",
    "volume in he energy-efficien renovation of residential and non-residential buildings. Furthermore, his Weekly Repor presents a differentiated eval­ uation of hree energy-efficien renovation sectors: roof/wall insulation, window/door replacements, and heating/air con­ ditioning system renewal.8 In addition, he real developmen of investments in energy-efficien renovation are presented here o accoun for he strong price increases of recen years. A mix of price indicators are used o measure deflation, as the official price statistics do no directly reflec he individual energy-efficien renovation sectors. Roof/wall insulation, win­ dows/doors, and heating/air conditioning are hus assigned o price indices for suitable produc areas and economic classes. Roof/wall insulation stagnating following growth A significan share of expenditure on energy-efficien ren­ ovation is spen on improving he insulation of he build­ ing envelope. A curren prices, over 16 billion euros were invested in insulating roofs, basemen ceilings, and facades of residential buildings in 2023. Once again, roughly six bil­ lion euros were spen on insulating commercial and public non-residential buildings (Figure 1). The nominal amoun invested in insulation, especially of residential buildings, increased significantly over he pas years. For example, he amoun invested in he insulation of residential facades and roofs in 2023 was nearly wice as high as in 2018. However, when considering he enormous price increases since 2021, he real value of investments in the insulation of residential buildings did no increase in 2022 or 2023. 5 Institu der deutschen Wirtschaft, Energetische Modernisierung des Gebäudebestandes: Her­ ausforderungen für private Eigentümer.

Spending on building insula­ tion in he commercial and public sectors rose again from 2019. However, only in 2020 were he nominal increases sufficien enough o reach he real investmen level of 2013. Investments in he insulation of non-residential buildings, in contrast, were only around 80 percen of he initial level in 2024. Window and exterior door replacements rending downward The amoun spen on window and exterior door replacements in residential buildings has barely changed over many years (Figure 2). For example, around 13.5 billion euros were spen on window and exterior door replacements from 2017 o 2020. Only recently has spending increased noticeably. However, the nominal increases were considerably lower han he high price increases due o he extremely high costs of glass production. Accordingly, real investments in window/exte­ rior door replacements in he pas hree years have declined sharply: In 2023, he real investmen level was nearly 25 per­ cen lower han i was in 2013. In price-adjusted erms, investments in he replacemen of windows and exterior doors of commercial and public non-residential buildings declined even more markedly dur­ ing he observation period. In 2023, real investments were 30 percen lower han in 2013. In nominal erms, abou five billion euros have been spen on window and exterior door replacements by commercial and public building owners in 2024. Renewed growth in heating system renewal since 2020 Compared o energy-efficien retrofi ing of building enve­ lopes via insulation or he replacemen of windows and exte­ rior doors, spending on heating system renewal has expe­ rienced stronger growth (Figure 3). Spending on heating system renewal in he residential housing stock has nearly doubled in nominal erms over he las 10 years. Although heating construction prices rose even more sharply han prices for energy-saving measures on he building enve­ lope, he increases in spending were enough o maintain a high level of real investments in he renewal of heating sys­ tems in residential buildings. I is assumed ha households are also investing in new gas heating systems before hey become subjec o stric regulations. However, investments narrowly missed reaching he peak value of real investments from 2017 in 2023. Investments in heating and air conditioning (AC) echnol­ ogy for non-residential buildings have been on an upward trend for many years. From 2011 o 2017, spending on heat­ ing and AC echnology increased from roughly six o nearly nine billion euros. Moreover, because he increase in spend­ ing outpaced price increases in his sector, real investments rose as well. Compared o 2017, however, commercial and public building owners’ spending has declined consider­",
    "ably. As heating and AC echnology prices experienced a strong increase a he same ime, real investments declined by nearly 30 percen compared o 2013.

Due o he climb in energy prices since 2021, saving energy has increased in importance as a reason for modernizing owner-occupied or rented residential buildings (Figure 5).10 While only nine percen of investors cited energy savings as a reason for modernizing buildings in 2020, he figure had risen o 16 percen in 2022. The parallel sharp rise in financing costs and construction prices is likely why he change in reasons for modernizing has no been reflected in a real increase in investments in energy-efficien renovation of residential buildings. In addi­ tion, he survey on modernization reasons shows ha even in 2022, increasing comfor and maintaining value were still seen as more importan investmen reasons, with response rates of 23 percen and 20 percent, respectively. Energy-related renovation in commercial and public structural engineering continuing its downward slide Combining he results for investments in he individual sectors of energy-efficien public and commercial building renovation results in a concerning picture. In 2023, nearly 20 billion euros were spen on he energy-efficien renova­ tion of non-residential buildings, around 25 percen more than in 2013. However, as prices for construction work rose by over 50 percen during he same period, one quarter less is being invested in he energy-efficien renovation of pub­ lic and commercial buildings in real erms compared o 10 years ago (Figure 6). Investmen activity in energy-efficien renovation developed markedly worse han in other sectors of public and commer­ cial structural engineering. In particular, he construction of new buildings increased",
    "considerably. In 2023, investments in new construction were abou 25 percen higher han in 2013 in price-adjusted erms despite he curren weak phase. Measures other han energy-efficiency measures on existing buildings also suffered real losses. In price-adjusted erms, spending was 17 percen lower in 2023 compared o 2013. The decline was hus noticeably lower han in energy-efficien renovation. For many years, public and commercial investors were hesi­ tan o renovate buildings o improve energy efficiency, likely due o comparatively low oil and gas prices. In addition, he structural change in he non-residential housing stock is occurring more strongly in new construction han in residen­ tial construction. Currently, i should also be noted ha pub­ lic authorities in particular are ied o nominal investmen 9 Martin Gornig und Katrin Klarhöfer, “Investments in energy-efficien building renovation are on a downward slide,” DIW Weekly Repor no. 32/33 (2023): 225-232 (available online). 10 Katrin Klarhöfer, Christopher Kramp, and Christian Tiller, “Bestandsinvestitionen 2022. Struk­ tur der Investitionstätigkei in den Wohnungs- und Nichtwohnungsbeständen,” BBSR-Online- Pub­ likation no. 80 (2024) (in Germna; available online). Energy-efficien renovation of residential buildings losing momentum overall Overall, a bleak picture emerges when looking a investments in he energy-efficien renovation of residential buildings: Over he pas 10 years, annual spending on his ype of reno­ vation increased by more han 65 percen o nearly 53 billion euros. However, when considering price increases, real invest­ ments in 2023 were barely higher han in 2013 (Figure 4). The firs low poin of real investments in energy-efficien reno­ vation of residential buildings was in 2015 and was followed by a significan recovery in real investmen activity. I had reached its previous peak value in 2021, when he annual otal investmen amoun was abou eigh percen greater han he base year value. However, he considerable price increases in 2022 and 2023 almos canceled ou he real growth in invest­ ments entirely. Investments in he energy-efficien renovation of buildings thus developed markedly worse han in other areas of resi­ dential construction. Construction of new housing in particu­ lar experienced strong growth until 2020. Despite he curren weak phase, investments in new construction were around 11 percen higher in price-adjusted erms in 2023 han in 2013. Other measures on existing buildings, such as he moderniza­ tion of sanitary facilities or general maintenance, also resulted in real growth over he entire period. In price-adjusted erms, such spending was 15 percen higher in 2023 han in 2013.

Conclusion: Trend reversal in energy-efficien building renovation urgently needed There is no doub ha he energy efficiency of he building stock needs urgen improvement. In ligh of he weak real investmen activity in recen years, energy-efficien reno­ vation of he existing building stock mus be quadrupled. Binding minimum standards and renovation argets mus be se o reverse he rend in renovation activities.11 The long- term expected developmen of energy prices is a decisive fac­ tor for he willingness o inves in energy-efficien renovation. Political decisions on carbon pricing play a key role here irre­ spective of fluctuating raw materials prices. A reliably fore­ seeable path of further energy cos increases is essential for creating investmen incentives o reach he climate argets. Furthermore, here mus be appropriate funding conditions to achieve a noticeable increase in investments in he ener­ gy-efficien renovation of existing buildings. A he end of 2023, he German Federal Governmen reorganized he fund­ ing measures in he building sector as par of he Climate Action Program. The Federal Funding for Efficien Buildings program is he main approach o energy-efficien improve­ ments in he building stock.12 Since he beginning of 2024, the Kreditanstal für Wiederaufbau and he Federal Office of Economics and Expor Control (Bundesam für Wirtschaf und Ausfuhrkontrolle) have made newly structured funding pro­ grams available for he energy-efficien renovation of resi­ dential and non-residential buildings. The new focus of he funding programs has been accompa­ nied by a sharp increase in funding for energy-efficien ren­ ovation. Funds in he amoun of 16.7 billion euros for 2024 have been earmarked in he Klima- und Transformationsfonds for Federal Funding of Efficien Buildings.13 This represents an increase of almos 50 percen compared o he funding for 2023.14 Compared o he long-term average, he subsidies are 11 Sophie M.

The increase in nominal funding is offse by higher construction and financing costs in particu­ lar. Interes charges are likely o be almos hree imes higher compared o he end of he 2010s, even after he European Central Bank’s further interes rate cuts. Construction costs have risen by an average of more han 40 percen in he same period. If policymakers really wan o provide a strong impe­ tus for energy-efficien renovation activities in existing resi­ dential buildings, hey mus be prepared o inves significantly higher amounts",
