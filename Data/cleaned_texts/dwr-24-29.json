Katharina Spieß, Katharina Wrohlich, and Elena Ziege\n\nABSTRACT\n\nOn average, mothers and fathers in Germany divide paid work \n\nand care work very unequally. Mothers often only work part \n\ntime, which results in further gender inequalities in the labor \n\nmarket. A current analysis of data from the German Family \n\nDemography Panel Study (FReDA) shows that the popula­\n\ntion’s attitudes toward the ideal division of work between \n\ncouples with children under 12 are considerably more egalitar­\n\nian than the actual behavior of couples with young children of \n\ndifferent ages. This discrepancy is due in part to the financial \n\nincentives of the German tax and transfer system for married \n\ncouples, which arise from the interplay between income split­\n\nting (Ehegattensplitting) and the tax treatment of mini-jobs. In \n\naddition, childcare infrastructure is insufficient and a very high \n\ngender pay gap persists in Germany. If policymakers want to \n\ndismantle inequalities in the labor market, the tax and transfer \n\nsystem must be modernized and childcare options expanded \n\nto make a more equal division of paid work and care work \n\nbetween parents more appealing.\n\nIn recent years, labor market gender inequalities have increas­\n\ningly become the focus of public attention and thus also of \n\npolicy discussions. At the same time, there are few meas­\n\nurable advances in tackling these inequalities in Germany. \n\nFor example, the gender pay gap has remained at 18 per­\n\ncent1 for many years and is very high in a European compari­\n\nson.2 Empirical labor market research shows that parenthood \n\nexacerbates labor market gender inequalities considerably. \n\nCountless studies on what is known as the “child penalty” \n\nhave shown that the gender differences in gross hourly wages \n\nand hours worked— and thus gross yearly wages— increase \n\nconsiderably following the birth of a couple’s first child and \n\nremain relatively constant at an older age.3\n\nA major reason for the increase in labor market gender ine­\n\nqualities is due to paid work and care work: Following the \n\nbirth of a couple’s first child, the couple divides paid and care \n\nwork less equally. For example, there are major differences \n\nbetween mothers and fathers when it comes to parental leave. \n\nAlthough the share of fathers taking parental leave has risen \n\nconsiderably over the past 15 years, not least in thanks to the \n\nintroduction of parental benefits (Elterngeld) in 2007, the major­\n\nity still do not take parental leave. Fathers who do take paren­\n\ntal leave take it for significantly shorter periods than mothers.4 \n\nFollowing parental leave, mothers primarily work part time \n\nwhen they reenter the labor market, even if they had worked \n\nfull time previously. This is almost never the case for fathers.5\n\n1\t\n\nCf.

In contrast, couples with older chil­\n\ndren are significantly less likely to opt for the male bread­\n\nwinner model at around only ten percent. These figures \n\nare based on data from the German Family Demography \n\nPanel Study (FReDA), which is representative of the pop­\n\nulation in Germany aged 18 to 50 (Box 1).\n\nAround 12 to 16 percent of all western German couples with \n\nchildren are, depending on the age of the youngest child, \n\nboth employed full time. Parents choose the adult worker \n\nmodel, in which both parents work full time, considerably \n\nmore often than the dual earner/dual carer model, in which \n\nboth parents work part time with around 30 hours a week \n\neach: Only three to five percent of all couples in western \n\nGermany follow this model.\n\nIn eastern Germany the dual earner/dual carer model is \n\nalso not very widespread. There, both parents work full time \n\nmuch more frequently than in the west: More than 40 per­\n\ncent of couples whose youngest child is three or older fol­\n\nlow the adult worker model, more than twice the number of \n\ncouples in western Germany. However, for couples whose \n\nyoungest child is youngest than three, the one-and-a-half-\n\nearner model is most widespread in both the east and west.\n\nPopulation attitudes toward the division of paid \n\nand care work are more egalitarian than reality\n\nCurrent surveys indicate that the one-and-a-half-earner \n\nmodel and the associated unequal division of paid work and \n\ncare work between mothers and fathers is not viewed as ideal \n\nby a significant share of young families. For example, the \n\nGerman Federal Government’s 2023 Report on Fathers cites \n\nsurvey results according to which around half of all fathers \n\nstate that fathers and mothers should ideally each take on \n\nhalf of childcare duties. However, this is only actually the \n\ncase in 21 percent of families. The same survey determined \n\nthat more than 40 percent of the fathers surveyed would like \n\nto take on a larger share of childcare than they actually do.6\n\n6\t Cf. Bundesministerium für Familie, Senioren, Frauen und Jugend, Väterreport 2023: Entwicklun­\n\ngen und Daten zur Vielfalt der Väter in Deutschland (2023) (in German; available online).\n\nUsing the FReDA data, we can analyze in more detail how \n\nmany hours of parental employment, depending on the age \n\nof the youngest child, the population theoretically believes is \n\nideal. All FReDA participants are asked, regardless of whether \n\nor not they have children, about their attitude toward this topic. \n\nParticipants are surveyed about a hypothetical couple whose \n\nyoungest child in the household is two, four, or eight years old.7 \n\nThese attitudes reflect the average social norms that parents \n\nface when deciding on the division of paid work and care work.\n\nAnalyzing data from 2021 reveals that the one-and-a-half-\n\nearner model is most frequently viewed as the ideal division \n\nof labor between parents. More than 40 percent of respond­\n\nents in western Germany think that the one-and-a-half-earner \n\nmodel is the ideal division of paid work for couples with \n\n7\t Cf. also Martin Bujard and Leonie Kleinschrot, \"Wieviel sollten Mütter und Väter arbeiten?

These figures are lower \n\nin the east, where only around one third of the respondents \n\nthink that this arrangement is ideal for couples with a two-\n\nyear-old child. Only 20 percent of the respondents in the east \n\nbelieve this arrangement is ideal for couples with older chil­\n\ndren (four or eight) (Figure 2).\n\nHowever, in both eastern and western Germany, the share of \n\nfamilies actually following the one-and-a-half-earner model \n\nis considerably higher than the share of FReDA respond­\n\nents with and without children who think this model is \n\nideal. While, for example, 63 percent of couples in western \n\nGermany whose youngest child is between six and ten live \n\naccording to the one-and-a-half-earner model, only 42 percent \n\nof western German respondents think this division of work \n\nis ideal for couples with children in this age group. In east­\n\nern Germany, too, significantly more couples with children \n\nchoose the one-and-a-half-earner model than corresponds to \n\nthe attitudes of young and middle-aged adults: Thirty-eight \n\npercent of couples whose youngest child is of primary school \n\nage follow this arrangement, but only 21 percent of eastern \n\nGerman respondents view it as ideal.\n\nRespondents in eastern Germany predominantly consider the \n\nadult worker model with two parents working full-time to be \n\nideal as long as the youngest child is older than three. Sixty-two \n\npercent of eastern German respondents believe that this divi­\n\nsion of work is ideal for couples with an eight-year-old child. \n\nThe share of western German respondents who consider it \n\nas ideal is much lower, at 38 percent. However, the share of \n\ncouples that put the adult worker model into practice is sig­\n\nnificantly smaller in both parts of the country: only 16 percent \n\nand 43 percent in western and eastern Germany, respectively.\n\nYet the largest discrepancy between general attitudes and \n\nactual behaviors can be observed in relation to the dual \n\nearner/dual carer model. This arrangement, in which both \n\nparents work around 30 hours per week, is practiced by three \n\nBox 1\n\nFReDA: German Family Demography Panel Study\n\nThe analyses in this Weekly Report use data from the first wave of \n\nFReDA, the German Family Demography Panel Study1 FReDA is \n\na new panel survey that began in 2021. It is a representative sur­\n\nvey of people living in Germany aged 18 to 50 years old and thus \n\nfocuses on young and middle-aged adults. As part of FReDA, data \n\non partnerships and family life is collected twice a year. An “anchor \n\nperson” in the household as well as their partner are surveyed. \n\nOverall, more than 30,000 interviews were conducted in fall 2023. \n\nFReDA includes questions on numerous demographic, psycholog­\n\nical, economic, and sociological aspects of life. Special attention \n\nis paid to family planning and forms of cohabitation. Depending \n\non the respondents’ family situation, parent-child relationships or \n\nintergenerational relationships are also addressed. The FReDA \n\nsurvey makes it possible to make international comparisons with \n\nnumerous other countries in Europe and worldwide, as every three \n\nyears the questionnaire corresponds to that of the Generations \n\nand Gender Survey (GGS).2 In 2022, the German Family Panel \n\n(pairfam) study was integrated into FReDA and continues on in this \n\nform. So far, data from the first two waves, conducted from 2021 to \n\n2023, are available.\n\nThe analyses are based on statements of the anchor person on \n\ntheir own employment, the employment of their partner, and their \n\nown attitudes toward the employment of parents from the first \n\nwave in 2021. The question about their own employment was “To \n\nwhat extent are you employed? Are you...?” Answer options are:\n\n•\t\n\nEmployed full time\n\n•\t\n\nEmployed part time\n\n1\t\n\nFReDA stands for Family Research and Demographic Analysis.\n\n2\t Cf. the information on the Genations and Gender Survey (GGS) on the website of the Federal \n\nInstitute for Population Research (Bundesinstituts für Bevölkerungsforschung) (in German; availa-\n\nble online).\n\n•\t\n\nMarginally employed, in a mini-job, or a one-euro job\n\nThe question about the partner’s employment is: “Has your partner \n\nperformed paid work in the past weeks?” with the following answer \n\noptions:\n\n•\t\n\nYes, paid work\n\n•\t\n\nYes, paid work, but they are on vacation, parental leave, or \n\nsimilar\n\n•\t\n\nNo, no paid work, but looking for work\n\n•\t\n\nNo, no paid work and not looking for work\n\n•\t\n\nI don’t know\n\nThe question “How many hours does your partner normally work \n\nper week in this job or in this company, including overtime?” is \n\nused for people in paid employment to differentiate between full-\n\ntime and part-time employment. Full-time employment is defined \n\nas working 35 hours or more per week.\n\nTo find out attitudes toward parental employment, the following \n\nquestion was asked: “Consider a family with a mother, father, and \n\ntwo children where the youngest child is two years old. Should the \n\nmother work full time, part time, or not work at all?”\n\nThe question is repeated for the father and in two other scenarios \n\nin which the youngest child is four or eight years old. FReDA is \n\na joint project of the Federal Institute for Population Research \n\n(Bundesinstitut für Bevölkerungsforschung, BiB), GESIS – Leibniz-\n\nInstitut für Sozialwissenschaften, and the University of Cologne. BiB \n\nis responsible for the overall project coordination.\n\n205\n\nDIW Weekly Report 29+30+31/2024\n\nEMPLOYMENT PATTERNS\n\nto six percent of all couples in western and eastern Germany, \n\ndepending on the age of the child. However, it is viewed as \n\nideal by a significant share of respondents: Around 30 per­\n\ncent of respondents in eastern and western Germany think \n\nthat this is the ideal division of paid work for couples whose \n\nyoungest child is two years old. If the youngest child is four \n\nyears old, more than 20 percent still consider it best. In the \n\ncase of an eight-year-old child, 18 percent of respondents in \n\nwestern Germany and 15 percent of respondents in eastern \n\nGermany consider the dual earner/dual carer model as ideal.\n\nOverall, the analysis shows that the share of respondents who \n\nfind an egalitarian division of paid work (either in the adult \n\nworker model or the dual earner/dual carer model) to be ideal \n\nis considerably higher in eastern Germany, regardless of the \n\nage of the youngest child, compared to the share of respond­\n\nents who prefer an unequal division. It is somewhat differ­\n\nent in western Germany, where respondents think the male \n\nbreadwinner model or one-and-a-half-earner model are the \n\nideal arrangement for couples whose youngest child is either \n\ntwo or four years olds. However, if the youngest child is eight \n\nyears old or older, the majority of western German respondents \n\nalso think that an egalitarian division of paid work is ideal.8\n\nTax and transfer system make the one-and-a-half \n\nearner model in particular financially attractive\n\nThere are countless individual reasons why the actual divi­\n\nsion of paid and care work within couples deviates so much \n\nfrom the ideal. There may be working conditions that make it \n\nimpossible to work the desired number of hours or there may \n\nbe structural restrictions, such as a lack of childcare spots. \n\nIn addition, the financial incentives from the tax and trans­\n\nfer system in Germany and the different average wages of \n\nmen and women influence couples’ employment decisions. \n\nTo illustrate these financial incentives, we simulate the net \n\nhousehold income of five different employment combina­\n\ntions for married couples. We assumed average gross hourly \n\nwages for men (25.30 euros) and women (20.80 euros) 9 for \n\nthe simulations (Box 2).\n\nThe simulated models are the male breadwinner model \n\n(father working full time, mother unemployed), two versions \n\nof the one-and-a-half-earner model (father working full time, \n\nmother working either 20 hours or only marginally with six \n\nhours), the adult worker model (both parents working full \n\ntime), and the dual earner/dual carer model (both parents \n\nworking 30 hours a week).\n\n8\t Interestingly, men and women’s attitudes toward paid and care work are very similar, regard­\n\nless of the age of the youngest child. However, a larger share of women prefer the dual earner/\n\ndual carer model compared to men, who tend to prefer the adult worker model.\n\n9\t These values represent the average gross hourly wages of men and women in 2023. Cf. Statis­\n\ntisches Bundesamt, “Gender Pay Gap 2023: Frauen verdienten pro Stunde 18 Prozent weniger als \n\nMänner.”\n\nMonthly net household income is highest when \n\nboth parents work full time\n\nAs expected, the net household income is highest (4,861 euros \n\nper month) in the case of the adult worker model in which \n\nboth parents work full time (Figure 3). The one-and-a-half-\n\nearner model yields the second-highest monthly income \n\n(3,953 euros per month), slightly higher than the income \n\nfrom the dual earner/dual carer model (3,832 euros per \n\nmonth), despite the fact that the parents work the same \n\ntotal number of weekly hours in both. However, because the \n\nassumed gross hourly wage of men is 18 percent higher than \n\nthat of women (the current gender pay gap), the one-and-a-\n\nhalf-earner model yields a higher net income. If the mother \n\nis in employment only marginally for six hours a week, there \n\nis a significantly lower net income of 3,440 per month. As \n\nexpected, the net household income is lowest with the male \n\nbreadwinner model: only 2,941 euros per month.\n\nFigure 2\n\nEmployment arrangements viewed as ideal for couples with \n\nchildren in Germany\n\nIn percent\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\nToddler\n\n(1 to 2 years old)\n\nMale breadwinner model\n\nOne-and-a-half-earner model\n\nAdult worker model\n\nDual earner/dual carer model\n\nOther\n\nMale breadwinner model\n\nOne-and-a-half-earner model\n\nAdult worker model\n\nDual earner/dual carer model\n\nOther\n\nPreschool age\n\n(3 to 5 years old)\n\nPrimary school age\n\n(6 to 10 years old)\n\nEastern Germany\n\nWestern Germany\n\nNotes: In the male breadwinner model, the father works full time and the mother is not employed.

If we divide the net household income by the \n\ntotal number of hours worked by both parents, the income \n\nfrom the one-and-a-half-earner model in which the mother \n\nis marginally employed (six hours a week) is the highest \n\nat 17.30 euros net per hour. This is closely followed by the \n\nmale breadwinner model at 17 euros per hour. In the one-\n\nand-a-half-earner model in which the mother is employed \n\npart time (20 hours per week) or in the dual earner/dual \n\ncarer model, in which both parents work 30 hours per week, \n\nthe net income per hour worked is significantly lower at \n\n15.20 euros and 14.70 euros per hour, respectively. It is the \n\nlowest, 14 euros per hour, when both parents are employed \n\nfull time (Figure 4).\n\nWhen using the adult worker model as a reference model and \n\ncomparing the total work hours of both parents and the net \n\nhousehold income with the other models, it becomes evident: \n\nThe one-and-a-half-earner model with the mother employed in \n\na mini-job (six hours a week) results in the household earning \n\n71 percent of the net income of the reference household, while \n\nonly having to work 57 percent of the total hours worked by the \n\nreference household. For the one-and-a-half-earner model with \n\nthe mother in part time work (20 hours a week), the house­\n\nhold earns 81 percent of the net income with 75 percent of \n\nBox 2\n\nMethodology\n\nWe calculated the net incomes of stylized households for \n\ndifferent employment combinations using the GETTSIM soft­\n\nware. GETTSIM (GErman Taxes and Transfers SIMulator) is a \n\nprogram that was jointly developed by researchers at several \n\nresearch institutes and universities in Germany, including DIW \n\nBerlin.1 The program is an open-source project and freely avail­\n\nable to the public.2\n\nGETTSIM can be used for any household situation, employ­\n\nment situation, and income situation to simulate relevant pa­\n\nrameters of the German tax and transfer system. This includes, \n\nfor example, households’ tax burden, individual social security \n\ncontributions, and transfer payments such as unemployment, \n\nchild benefits, housing benefits, minimum income benefits \n\n(Bürgergeld), and pension entitlements.\n\nIn this Weekly Report, we simulate the income situation of \n\nfive households consisting of a married couple with one child \n\neach with a different parental employment combination. Using \n\nGETTSIM, the social security contributions, tax burden, and \n\ntransfer payments such as child benefits are calculated for \n\nthese households for 2023 to determine the net disposable \n\nincome.

This is due to the \n\ninterplay of Ehegattensplitting (joint taxation of married cou­\n\nples with full income splitting), the tax treatment of income \n\nfrom mini-jobs, and non-contributory dependents’ insur­\n\nance, where spouses can be insured for free on statutory \n\nhealth insurance. Moreover, the gross hourly wage of men, \n\nwhich is 18 percent higher on average, also makes an une­\n\nqual division of paid work more attractive in the short term.\n\nIf policymakers want to combat labor market gender inequal­\n\nities and the unequal division of unpaid care work, reforms \n\nto the tax and transfer system need to be initiated. Proposals \n\nfor reforms to Ehegattensplitting, for example in the form of \n\nde facto income splitting with a transfer amount, have been \n\non the table for some time.13 Alternatives to non-contributory \n\ndependents’ insurance should also be discussed.14 It would \n\n11\t Sophia Schmitz et al., Bundesweite Standards für bedarfsgerechte Angebote, insbesondere \n\nGanztagsangebote, in der Kindertagesbetreuung für Kinder bis zum Schuleintritt.

Katharina Spieß, Katharina Wrohlich, and Elena Ziege\n\nABSTRACT\n\nOn average, mothers and fathers in Germany divide paid work \n\nand care work very unequally. Mothers often only work par \n\ntime, which results in further gender inequalities in he labor \n\nmarket. A curren analysis of data from he German Family \n\nDemography Panel Study (FReDA) shows ha he popula­\n\ntion’s a itudes oward he ideal division of work between \n\ncouples with children under 12 are considerably more egalitar­\n\nian han he actual behavior of couples with young children of \n\ndifferen ages. This discrepancy is due in par o he financial \n\nincentives of he German ax and ransfer system for married \n\ncouples, which arise from he interplay between income split­\n\nting (Ehega enspli ing) and he ax reatmen of mini-jobs. In \n\naddition, childcare infrastructure is insufficien and a very high \n\ngender pay gap persists in Germany. If policymakers wan o \n\ndismantle inequalities in he labor market, he ax and ransfer \n\nsystem mus be modernized and childcare options expanded \n\nto make a more equal division of paid work and care work \n\nbetween parents more appealing.\n\nIn recen years, labor marke gender inequalities have increas­\n\ningly become he focus of public a ention and hus also of \n\npolicy discussions. A he same ime, here are few meas­\n\nurable advances in ackling hese inequalities in Germany. \n\nFor example, he gender pay gap has remained a 18 per­\n\ncent1 for many years and is very high in a European compari­\n\nson.2 Empirical labor marke research shows ha parenthood \n\nexacerbates labor marke gender inequalities considerably. \n\nCountless studies on wha is known as he “child penalty” \n\nhave shown ha he gender differences in gross hourly wages \n\nand hours worked— and hus gross yearly wages— increase \n\nconsiderably following he birth of a couple’s firs child and \n\nremain relatively constan a an older age.3\n\nA major reason for he increase in labor marke gender ine­\n\nqualities is due o paid work and care work: Following he \n\nbirth of a couple’s firs child, he couple divides paid and care \n\nwork less equally. For example, here are major differences \n\nbetween mothers and fathers when i comes o parental leave. \n\nAlthough he share of fathers aking parental leave has risen \n\nconsiderably over he pas 15 years, no leas in hanks o he \n\nintroduction of parental benefits (Elterngeld) in 2007, he major­\n\nity still do no ake parental leave. Fathers who do ake paren­\n\ntal leave ake i for significantly shorter periods han mothers.4 \n\nFollowing parental leave, mothers primarily work par ime \n\nwhen hey reenter he labor market, even if hey had worked \n\nfull ime previously. This is almos never he case for fathers.5\n\n1\t\n\nCf.

In contrast, couples with older chil­\n\ndren are significantly less likely o op for he male bread­\n\nwinner model a around only en percent. These figures \n\nare based on data from he German Family Demography \n\nPanel Study (FReDA), which is representative of he pop­\n\nulation in Germany aged 18 o 50 (Box 1).\n\nAround 12 o 16 percen of all western German couples with \n\nchildren are, depending on he age of he younges child, \n\nboth employed full ime. Parents choose he adul worker \n\nmodel, in which both parents work full ime, considerably \n\nmore often han he dual earner/dual carer model, in which \n\nboth parents work par ime with around 30 hours a week \n\neach: Only hree o five percen of all couples in western \n\nGermany follow his model.\n\nIn eastern Germany he dual earner/dual carer model is \n\nalso no very widespread. There, both parents work full ime \n\nmuch more frequently han in he west: More han 40 per­\n\ncen of couples whose younges child is hree or older fol­\n\nlow he adul worker model, more han wice he number of \n\ncouples in western Germany. However, for couples whose \n\nyounges child is younges han hree, he one-and-a-half-\n\nearner model is mos widespread in both he eas and west.\n\nPopulation a itudes oward he division of paid \n\nand care work are more egalitarian han reality\n\nCurren surveys indicate ha he one-and-a-half-earner \n\nmodel and he associated unequal division of paid work and \n\ncare work between mothers and fathers is no viewed as ideal \n\nby a significan share of young families. For example, he \n\nGerman Federal Government’s 2023 Repor on Fathers cites \n\nsurvey results according o which around half of all fathers \n\nstate ha fathers and mothers should ideally each ake on \n\nhalf of childcare duties. However, his is only actually he \n\ncase in 21 percen of families. The same survey determined \n\ntha more han 40 percen of he fathers surveyed would like \n\nto ake on a larger share of childcare han hey actually do.6\n\n6\t Cf.

Sixty-two \n\npercen of eastern German respondents believe ha his divi­\n\nsion of work is ideal for couples with an eight-year-old child. \n\nThe share of western German respondents who consider i \n\nas ideal is much lower, a 38 percent. However, he share of \n\ncouples ha pu he adul worker model into practice is sig­\n\nnificantly smaller in both parts of he country: only 16 percen \n\nand 43 percen in western and eastern Germany, respectively.\n\nYe he larges discrepancy between general a itudes and \n\nactual behaviors can be observed in relation o he dual \n\nearner/dual carer model.

I is a representative sur­\n\nvey of people living in Germany aged 18 o 50 years old and hus \n\nfocuses on young and middle-aged adults. As par of FReDA, data \n\non partnerships and family life is collected wice a year. An “anchor \n\nperson” in he household as well as heir partner are surveyed. \n\nOverall, more han 30,000 interviews were conducted in fall 2023. \n\nFReDA includes questions on numerous demographic, psycholog­\n\nical, economic, and sociological aspects of life. Special a ention \n\nis paid o family planning and forms of cohabitation. Depending \n\non he respondents’ family situation, parent-child relationships or \n\nintergenerational relationships are also addressed. The FReDA \n\nsurvey makes i possible o make international comparisons with \n\nnumerous other countries in Europe and worldwide, as every hree \n\nyears he questionnaire corresponds o ha of he Generations \n\nand Gender Survey (GGS).2 In 2022, he German Family Panel \n\n(pairfam) study was integrated into FReDA and continues on in his \n\nform. So far, data from he firs wo waves, conducted from 2021 o \n\n2023, are available.\n\nThe analyses are based on statements of he anchor person on \n\ntheir own employment, he employmen of heir partner, and heir \n\nown a itudes oward he employmen of parents from he firs \n\nwave in 2021. The question abou heir own employmen was “To \n\nwha exten are you employed?

Full-time employmen is defined \n\nas working 35 hours or more per week.\n\nTo find ou a itudes oward parental employment, he following \n\nquestion was asked: “Consider a family with a mother, father, and \n\ntwo children where he younges child is wo years old.

If he younges child is four \n\nyears old, more han 20 percen still consider i best. In he \n\ncase of an eight-year-old child, 18 percen of respondents in \n\nwestern Germany and 15 percen of respondents in eastern \n\nGermany consider he dual earner/dual carer model as ideal.\n\nOverall, he analysis shows ha he share of respondents who \n\nfind an egalitarian division of paid work (either in he adul \n\nworker model or he dual earner/dual carer model) o be ideal \n\nis considerably higher in eastern Germany, regardless of he \n\nage of he younges child, compared o he share of respond­\n\nents who prefer an unequal division. I is somewha differ­\n\nen in western Germany, where respondents hink he male \n\nbreadwinner model or one-and-a-half-earner model are he \n\nideal arrangemen for couples whose younges child is either \n\ntwo or four years olds. However, if he younges child is eigh \n\nyears old or older, he majority of western German respondents \n\nalso hink ha an egalitarian division of paid work is ideal.8\n\nTax and ransfer system make he one-and-a-half \n\nearner model in particular financially a ractive\n\nThere are countless individual reasons why he actual divi­\n\nsion of paid and care work within couples deviates so much \n\nfrom he ideal. There may be working conditions ha make i \n\nimpossible o work he desired number of hours or here may \n\nbe structural restrictions, such as a lack of childcare spots. \n\nIn addition, he financial incentives from he ax and rans­\n\nfer system in Germany and he differen average wages of \n\nmen and women influence couples’ employmen decisions. \n\nTo illustrate hese financial incentives, we simulate he ne \n\nhousehold income of five differen employmen combina­\n\ntions for married couples. We assumed average gross hourly \n\nwages for men (25.30 euros) and women (20.80 euros) 9 for \n\nthe simulations (Box 2).\n\nThe simulated models are he male breadwinner model \n\n(father working full ime, mother unemployed), wo versions \n\nof he one-and-a-half-earner model (father working full ime, \n\nmother working either 20 hours or only marginally with six \n\nhours), he adul worker model (both parents working full \n\ntime), and he dual earner/dual carer model (both parents \n\nworking 30 hours a week).\n\n8\t Interestingly, men and women’s a itudes oward paid and care work are very similar, regard­\n\nless of he age of he younges child. However, a larger share of women prefer he dual earner/\n\ndual carer model compared o men, who end o prefer he adul worker model.\n\n9\t These values represen he average gross hourly wages of men and women in 2023. Cf. Statis­\n\ntisches Bundesamt, “Gender Pay Gap 2023: Frauen verdienten pro Stunde 18 Prozen weniger als \n\nMänner.”\n\nMonthly ne household income is highes when \n\nboth parents work full ime\n\nAs expected, he ne household income is highes (4,861 euros \n\nper month) in he case of he adul worker model in which \n\nboth parents work full ime (Figure 3). The one-and-a-half-\n\nearner model yields he second-highes monthly income \n\n(3,953 euros per month), slightly higher han he income \n\nfrom he dual earner/dual carer model (3,832 euros per \n\nmonth), despite he fac ha he parents work he same \n\ntotal number of weekly hours in both. However, because he \n\nassumed gross hourly wage of men is 18 percen higher han \n\ntha of women (the curren gender pay gap), he one-and-a-\n\nhalf-earner model yields a higher ne income. If he mother \n\nis in employmen only marginally for six hours a week, here \n\nis a significantly lower ne income of 3,440 per month. As \n\nexpected, he ne household income is lowes with he male \n\nbreadwinner model: only 2,941 euros per month.\n\nFigure 2\n\nEmploymen arrangements viewed as ideal for couples with \n\nchildren in Germany\n\nIn percent\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\nToddler\n\n(1 o 2 years old)\n\nMale breadwinner model\n\nOne-and-a-half-earner model\n\nAdul worker model\n\nDual earner/dual carer model\n\nOther\n\nMale breadwinner model\n\nOne-and-a-half-earner model\n\nAdul worker model\n\nDual earner/dual carer model\n\nOther\n\nPreschool age\n\n(3 o 5 years old)\n\nPrimary school age\n\n(6 o 10 years old)\n\nEastern Germany\n\nWestern Germany\n\nNotes: In he male breadwinner model, he father works full ime and he mother is no employed.

However, his model is empirically very rare.\n\nOne-and-a-half-earner model mos financially \n\na ractive per hour worked\n\nHowever, he ranking is quite differen when looking a \n\nmarried couples’ ne income per hour worked rather han \n\nper month. If we divide he ne household income by he \n\ntotal number of hours worked by both parents, he income \n\nfrom he one-and-a-half-earner model in which he mother \n\nis marginally employed (six hours a week) is he highes \n\na 17.30 euros ne per hour. This is closely followed by he \n\nmale breadwinner model a 17 euros per hour. In he one-\n\nand-a-half-earner model in which he mother is employed \n\npar ime (20 hours per week) or in he dual earner/dual \n\ncarer model, in which both parents work 30 hours per week, \n\nthe ne income per hour worked is significantly lower a \n\n15.20 euros and 14.70 euros per hour, respectively. I is he \n\nlowest, 14 euros per hour, when both parents are employed \n\nfull ime (Figure 4).\n\nWhen using he adul worker model as a reference model and \n\ncomparing he otal work hours of both parents and he ne \n\nhousehold income with he other models, i becomes evident: \n\nThe one-and-a-half-earner model with he mother employed in \n\na mini-job (six hours a week) results in he household earning \n\n71 percen of he ne income of he reference household, while \n\nonly having o work 57 percen of he otal hours worked by he \n\nreference household. For he one-and-a-half-earner model with \n\nthe mother in par ime work (20 hours a week), he house­\n\nhold earns 81 percen of he ne income with 75 percen of \n\nBox 2\n\nMethodology\n\nWe calculated he ne incomes of stylized households for \n\ndifferen employmen combinations using he GETTSIM soft­\n\nware.
