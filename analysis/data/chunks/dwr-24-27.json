Nearly one hird of greenhouse gas emissions in Germany are caused by private household consumption. Using Socio-­ Economic Panel (SOEP) data, his Weekly Repor calculates the amoun of CO2 equivalents emi ed by households due o residential energy use, nutrition, and ranspor in Germany. Consumption in hese hree areas alone results in average emissions ha exceed he emissions budge argeted for pri­ vate individuals more han wofold, with ranspor and residen­ tial energy-related emissions accounting for he larges share of emissions. Emissions increase as income increases, espe­ cially in he area of ransport, with air ravel as he main driver. Mea consumption is he main contributor o nutrition-related emissions, and household size and building ype contribute the mos o residential energy-related emissions. By identify­ ing he mos significan driver of emissions in each of he hree areas, argeted political instruments can be identified, such as simplifying housing swaps and he energy-efficien renovation of residential buildings, banning short-haul flights, and intro­ ducing an animal welfare levy. Human emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon diox­ ide (CO2), nitrous oxide, and methane are he main driver of climate change.1 According o he Federal Environmen Agency (Umweltbundesamt, UBA), around 673 million ons of greenhouse gases were emi ed in Germany in 2023, en percen less han in 2022.2 However, he Federal Climate Change Ac stipulates ha emissions mus be reduced by a leas 65 percen compared o 1990 levels by 2030. However, as of 2022, only 40 percen of his reduction had been achieved.3 To reduce greenhouse gas emissions more effectively, i is importan o understand heir primary driver. Policymakers should consider both he reduction potential in industry as well as in private households: After all, around one hird of emissions in Germany can be a ributed o private house­ hold consumption.4 This Weekly Repor calculates and ana­ lyzes he average per capita residential energy consump­ tion (housing), nutrition, and ransport-related emissions in Germany using individual and household information. The analyses are based on unpublished preliminary data from he 2023 Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) survey.5 We calculate per capita residential energy, nutrition, and rans­ port-related carbon footprint6 of private households based on respondents’ information on heir consumption behav­ ior (Box). First, he carbon footprin of he entire house­ hold is calculated. In a second step, he household’s otal 1 To be able o compare he effects of he various climate-active gases on",

I began in Wes Germany in 1984 and expanded its scope o include he new federal states in 1990; cf. Jan Goebel et al., “The German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP),” Journal of Economics and ­Statistics 239, no. 29 (2018): 345-360. 6 Carbon footprints indicate how many ons of CO2 equivalents (tCO2e) one person generates per year. I is a measure of one individual’s impac on he climate, see he DIW Berlin Glossary on the carbon footprin (in German; available online). 181 DIW Weekly Repor 27/2024 CARBON FOOTPRINT emissions are divided by he number of household mem­ bers, including children. Greenhouse gas emissions of private households exceed climate hresholds wofold According o he SOEP survey data, annual per capita emis­ sions in he hree areas (residential energy consumption, nutrition, and ransport) are around 6.5 tons of CO2 equiv­ alents (tCO2e). Each person in Germany emits an annual average of 0.7 tCO2e hrough he use of electricity in heir home (Figure 1). A further 2.2 tCO2e are due o heating and ho water preparation. Nutrition has an average impac of 1.6 tCO2e, while 2.0 tCO2e can be a ributed o ransport. Calculations using SOEP data are hus very close o he UBA’s calculations, which are calculated using a differen methodol­ ogy.7 The values in both calculations are significantly higher than he one o hree ons ha are—depending on he spe­ cific calculation—climate-compatible according o climate experts and he UBA.8 Greenhouse gas emissions increase with income Our calculations confirm ha households’ carbon footprin increases as equivalized income rises,9 primarily due o more transport-related emissions (Figure 2). In erms of nutrition and heating, higher-income households end o have slightly lower per capita emissions. The following sections ake a closer look a he composition of emissions in he areas of residential energy, nutrition, and ransport, and explain he differences between he income groups using information on all households for which an area-specific carbon foot­ prin was calculated. Living with others reduces CO2 emissions Emissions from residential use of electricity, heating, and ho water preparation are considered ogether below. On aver­ age, 2.9 tons of residential energy-related CO2e are emi ed per person per year. As people who live ogether share he use of electricity and heat, he number of people living in a household is decisive for he emissions caused per person 7 Cf. he website of he Federal Environmen Agency, Durchschni licher CO2-Fußabdruck pro",

Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, a climate researcher a he Potsdam Institute for Climate Impac Research (PIK), calculated a carbon footprin of around hree ons per year and per person for Germany, which would have o be achieved in order o comply with the Paris Climate Agreement—an individual CO2 budget, so o speak, cf. Dirk Messner et al., “The Budge Approach: A Framework for a Global Transformation oward a Low-Carbon Economy,” ­Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy 2, no. 3 (2010) (available online). How exactly his fig­ ure of hree ons per year and per person was calculated is explained very well on he website of the ARD program Panorama (FAQ: Wer verursach wie viele Treibhausgase?) (in German; available online). 9 The income situations of households of differen sizes and compositions are made comparable using equivalized income. To calculate he equivalized income, he incomes of all persons living in the household are added ogether and converted using a needs scale appropriate o he house­ hold structure.

A four-person house­ hold generates an average of 1.5 tCO2e per person and year, whereas a single-person",
    "household generates jus under 4.0 tCO2e per year (Figure 3). Using a linear regression model, we investigate he correla­ tion between various household characteristics and residen­ tial energy-related emissions per person (Table). The decisive factor is herefore he number of people in he household. In addition, he living space available per person has a signifi­ cant, albei smaller, influence on emissions: For each addi­ tional square meter of space, emissions per person rise by 0.022 tCO2e per year. These wo factors alone explain nearly half of he observed differences in residential energy-related emissions per capita. In contrast, he income available per person has no significan effec when he factors of people and space per person are aken into account. The ype and age of residential buildings also plays a role: People living in multiple-family residential buildings with more han four housing units create around half a on fewer emissions per person han people living in detached single or wo-family homes or farming infrastructure (Figure 4). In addition, he carbon footprin of people living in newer buildings is lower.10 Calculations also show ha he use of solar energy decreases he per capita carbon footprin in a household by around 0.7 tCO2e on average. Mea consumption affects nutrition-related emissions Around one quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions can be a ributed o food production, in particular from livestock farming, fisheries, and land use.11 Compared o livestock 10 Cf.

Box Data and methodology The carbon footprin of households in Germany due o residential energy consumption, nutrition, and ranspor are calculated using preliminary data from 2023 from he Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). As no weighting factors are currently available for 2023, preliminary weights from he 2022 survey are used, which ake into accoun the households los since he las published survey in 2021. People who firs participated in he survey in 2023 are hus no included. Furthermore, all refugee samples are no aken into account. Due o these restrictions, he sample is reduced o 7,304 respondents. The calculations are based on individual and household informa­ tion aken from household and personal surveys. A similar ap­ proach is followed in each of he hree areas analyzed: Information provided by respondents on how much hey spend on and how much hey consume of goods whose production results in green­ house gases emissions is converted into CO2 equivalents using he corresponding emission factors per uni of consumption. Emission factors from official sources are used, as he value chains in he individual countries differ and he use of national sources is hus the mos suitable and exac for calculating emissions.1 Emissions from specific areas were calculated as follows: Emissions caused by energy consumption in private households are",

Transpor emissions were calculated using data on car ownership, the ype of fuel used, ranspor expenditure, and he frequency of long and short-haul rips via bus, rain, ram, and airplane. Nutrition emissions were calculated using he information provided by re­ spondents on gender, age, weight, and frequency of mea and fish consumption. Missing information on he ype of heating is imputed logically, meaning i is assumed ha a household uses he same ype of heating as hey did in he previous survey as long as hey have no moved. Missing information on housing expenditure or con­ sumption are no imputed. When calculating emissions relating o nutrition, we assume ha he average die profile of he adults in the household applies for he children as well. In he area of rans­ port, he op and bo om one percen are replaced by percentile boundaries.2 For each of he hree areas, he analyses include all households for which he area-specific information was available. This means he number of cases vary between he individual areas. Data cleaning ook place in several phases of he area-specific emission calculations. In a similar way, we confirmed ha all outliers for each individual area are aken into account. These processes can lead o less pronounced differences in emissions by income. 2 To calculate he percentiles, a data se sorted by size is divided into 100 equal parts. Outliers with values larger han he 99th percentile of he sample and smaller han he bo om firs percen­ tile are replaced with limi values. 183 DIW Weekly Repor 27/2024 CARBON FOOTPRINT farming and animal feed production, plant-based foods have a significantly lower carbon footprint. Therefore, he fre­ quency of animal produc consumption is an importan fac­ tor in individual nutrition-related emissions. Studies show tha he origin of he food we ea is less importan han where our food comes from, as ransportation emissions are signifi­ cantly lower han production-related emissions.12 Based on he respondents’ information on heir dietary pref­ erences and weekly frequency of beef, pork, poultry, and fish consumption, nutrition-related emissions are calcu­ lated in combination with gender and age as indicators for the respondents’ necessary caloric intake.13 The die profiles are assigned o five categories in accordance with",

One intercontinental fligh emits more CO2 han one year of residential energy and nutrition- related emissions Transport-related emissions are calculated using household information on car ownership, he fuel ype used, use of pub­ lic ranspor (short-distance commuting with all public rans­ por ypes as well as long-distance commuting with rains and buses) as well as he number of domestic, European, and intercontinental flights and cruises aken. On average, he per capita ransport-related emissions are around 2.0 tCO2e per year, abou half of which come from car rips. The greates share of ransport-related emissions is due o flights. Emissions from car rips average 1.0 tCO2e per capita. An average round-trip fligh within Germany causes 0.24 tCO2e; for he same amount, a person could travel 8,000 kilometers by rain. According o he UBA, a domestic or European round-trip fligh emits 0.2 or 0.5 tCO2e, respectively, while an intercon­ tinental round-trip fligh emits 4.7 tCO2e.18 Therefore, here are major differences in ransport-related emissions per person depending on if and where hey fly. While each per­ son in Germany only flies once a year on average, frequen fliers fly en or more imes per year. People who do no fly a all have a ransport-related carbon footprin of around 1.0 tCO2e (Figure 6), while people who ake flights within Europe emi around 2.3 tCO2e per year according o he cal­ culations. For people who have aken one or more intercon­ tinental round-trip flights, heir ransport-related emissions are 9.3 tCO2e on average. People in he highes income decile (the en percen with the highes household incomes) emi seven imes as much",
    "CO2e as people in he lowes income decile in he area of ranspor (Figure 7). Emissions from car rips vary between 0.3 tCO2e for people in he lowes income decile and 1.4 tCO2e for people in he higher income deciles. A 4.1 tCO2e, flight-related emissions in he highes income decile are around en imes higher han in he lowes income decile a 0.4 tCO2e. The frequency a which indi­ viduals in he highes income decile fly intercontinentally results in heir emissions being 40 percen higher han he emissions of he ninth income decile. Conclusion: Greates emissions inequality is in transport Calculating he greenhouse gas emissions of German households ha can be a ributed o residential energy con­ sumption, nutrition, and ranspor showed ha here are clear main drivers in each area: For residential energy, i is 18 Umweltbundesamt, Flugreisen möglichs vermeiden und Alternativen nutzen (2022) (in ­German; available online). and 290 grams, respectively.14 According o he statistics by the Federal Office for Agriculture and Food (Bundesanstal für Landwirtschaf und Ernährung, BLE), a declining rend in average mea consumption has been observed in recen years.15 In 2023, he larges decline was observed in beef consumption, which is particularly harmful o he climate.16 One percen of SOEP respondents indicate hey follow a vegan diet, while 12 percen repor following a vegetarian diet.17 A high number of he la er nonetheless repor eat­ ing mea or fish occasionally (less han once a month and less han wo o hree imes a week, respectively). The large majority of he German population follows a low-mea die (47 percent) or a die with a mix of mea and plant-based foods (42 percent). Around one in en respondents reports to eating mea products several imes a day. Per capita (including children), he average nutrition-related emissions in Germany are 1.6 tCO2e. A vegetarian die results in an average of only 1.2 tCO2e per year (Figure 5). People who ea mea less han once a week emi around 1.5 tCO2e 14 This description is based on he definitions from he UBA, cf. Umweltbundesamt, Mein CO2-Schnellcheck (in German; available online). The SOEP survey asked abou he frequency of mea consumption per week or month. The data was converted into grams for his evaluation. 15 Bundesanstal für Landwirtschaf und Ernährung, “Pro-Kopf-Verzehr von Fleisch sink auf un­ ter 52 Kilogramm,” press release from April 4, 2024 (in German; available online). 16 Differen ypes of mea differ in heir emissions intensitiy: he production of beef causes more than wice as many emissions per kilogram as lamb and more han six imes he emissions of poultry meat, cf.

Frequen mea consumption is he main driver of nutrition-related green­ house gas emissions and flying is he main contributor o transport-related emissions. While he income-related differ­ ences are small and higher income groups end o have lower per capita emissions in he areas of residential energy con­ sumption and nutrition, people from higher-income house­ holds cause significantly more emissions han people from lower-income households in he area of ransport. To achieve he goal of carbon neutrality by 2045 as laid ou in the Federal Climate Change Act, massive individual as well as political efforts are required: Policymakers mus imple­ men and suppor measures ha increase energy efficiency in residential energy consumption, promote environmental­ ly-friendly eating habits, and expand sustainable ranspor options while reducing he emissions-intensive options. In addition o promoting climate-friendly echnologies, heir research, and piloting, as well as he economic incentives and accompanying social compensation measures, regula­ tion-based policy instruments also are needed in he ransi­ tion o a low-carbon economy. The analyses in his Weekly Repor poin o a number of pol­ icy measures ha foster he ecological ransition while aking social justice into account. For example, a hermal insula­ tion strategy for he mos inefficien buildings could resul in he mos emissions savings and make low-income house­ holds less vulnerable from energy price fluctuations.19 In addition, using existing housing more efficiently could cre­ ate major savings in he building sector. One instrumen o achieve his would be o simplify housing swaps, as was dis­ cussed in he Bundestag in 2023 and as has been enshrined in Austrian enancy law since 1982.20 This would no only comba he housing shortage, bu also reduce greenhouse gas emissions due o residential energy consumption. Reducing he number of flights offers he greates potential for reducing ransport-related emissions. The air raffic ax increase effective May 1, 2024, which, if passed on in full o customers, will increase he price of short-haul fligh ick­ ets by 15 euros and long-haul ickets by 70 euros, is likely to only have a minor impac on fligh demand, especially among he higher income groups ha fly more frequently.
