Behr, Merve Kücük, Maximilian Longmuir, and Karsten Neuhoff\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe pace of thermal retrofit of buildings in Germany remains \n\nslow. A Worst-First approach, prioritizing the retrofit of inef­\n\nficient buildings, would address energy- and social policy \n\nobjectives and deliver economic and climate benefits. Data \n\nfrom the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) show how \n\nsuch an approach would protect especially low-income house­\n\nholds often living in very inefficient buildings from heating \n\ncosts risks. This group comprises 28 percent of all tenants \n\nand 13 percent of all homeowners. Yet, uncertainty about the \n\ncost-benefit of retrofitting and other priorities of homeowners \n\nmean that not enough buildings are retrofitted. As a result, the \n\nsaving potentials, especially from very inefficient buildings, \n\nare not being realized. This would, however, be necessary to \n\nreduce heating cost risks and energy import dependency, \n\nand to meet climate targets. Better alignment of financing and \n\nsubsidy instruments with the ownership structure, the further \n\ndevelopment of building standards to include minimum \n\nenergy performance standards, and reform of tenancy law \n\ncould improve the situation.\n\nThermal retrofitting can effectively reduce high energy costs \n\nand cost risks due to energy price shocks.1 Low-income \n\nhouseholds that currently live in very inefficient buildings2 \n\nand spend up to 30 percent of their income on heating costs \n\nwould particularly benefit from such retrofits (Figure 1). The \n\nWorst-First approach, in which funding programs, building \n\nstandards, and other measures are designed to ensure that \n\nvery inefficient buildings are retrofitted first, would help \n\nthese households specifically. Energy cost subsidies such as \n\nWohngeld-Plus, which was expanded during the gas price cri­\n\nsis, or the climate dividend (Klimageld) discussed in relation \n\nto carbon prices, only partially address cost increases in very \n\ninefficient buildings, as the flat-rate payments do not cover \n\nthe higher cost burdens of inefficient homes.\n\nAlthough energy cost subsidies directly linked to heating or \n\ncarbon costs can mitigate the burden, they lead to high fis­\n\ncal costs as they reduce the incentives for investments in \n\nhigher energy efficiency. This dilemma can be addressed \n\nby accelerating the retrofitting of very inefficient buildings, \n\nideally before another energy price crisis occurs, and as a \n\nresponse to the climate crisis and the high level of depend­\n\nency on energy imports.\n\nWorst-First approach as a social program\n\nWe use the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) data \n\nto estimatete the heating cost distribution within income \n\ndeciles for the year 2024 and to compare it with two scenar­\n\nios featuring accelerated retrofitting of very inefficient build­\n\nings (Figure 1). The 2024 Energy Performance of Buildings \n\nDirective requires prioritizing thermal retrofitting of the \n\n43 percent worst-performing residential buildings.3 Scenario \n\n1 assumes that 70 percent of these buildings are retrofit­\n\nted, which corresponds to 30 percent of all buildings. In \n\n1 \n\nKarsten Neuhoff, Maximilian Longmuir, Mats Kröger, and Franziska Schütze, “Hohe Gasprei­\n\nsanstiege: Entlastungen notwendig,” DIW Wochenbericht no. 36 (2022) (in German; available on-\n\nline). Accessed on April 15, 2024. This applies to all other online sources in this report.\n\n2 In a European Parliament draft, 43 percent of buildings with the highest heating energy con­\n\nsumption are considered inefficient. European Parliament, Energy performance of buildings (re­\n\ncast) (2024) (available online). This Weekly Report refers to the buildings as “very inefficient.”\n\n3 European Parliament, Energy performance of buildings (recast) (2024) (available online).\n\n141\n\nDIW Weekly Report 19/2024\n\nTHERMAL RETROFITTING\n\nScenario 2, all 43 percent of very inefficient buildings are \n\nretrofitted (Box).\n\nThe scenario comparison shows that the energy cost burden \n\nrelative to the income of households in all income brackets \n\nis starkly reduced when retrofitting of very inefficient build­\n\nings is prioritized.\n\nHouseholds with very high shares of energy costs will ben­\n\nefit from this in particular. In Scenario 1, the heating cost \n\nexpenditure relative to the income falls from 19.8 percent \n\nto 15.5 percent for households with a particularly high cost \n\nburden in the second-lowest income decile (95th percen­\n\ntile). When all very inefficient buildings are retrofitted as in \n\nScenario 2, the heat energy cost share drops to 11.6 percent.\n\nOur analysis shows that tenants are considerably more \n\naffected by poorly insulated buildings than homeowners. \n\nTenants, on average, pay higher heating costs per square \n\nmeter than homeowners in all income brackets (Figure 2). \n\nOn average, the energy condition of rental housing is worse \n\nthan owner-occupied housing, an intensively discussed topic \n\nin the literature known as the tenant-landlord dilemma that \n\nis attributed to a number of factors.4 For example, unlike \n\n4 Jacob Ahlrich and Sebastian Rockstuhl, “Estimating fair rent increases after building retrofits: \n\nA max-min fairness approach,” Energy Policy 164 (2022): 112923; Martin Görnig and Katrin Klar­\n\nhöfer, “Investments in Energy-Efficient Building Renovation Are on a Downward Slide,” DIW Weekly \n\nReport no. 32/33 (2023): 225–232 (available online).\n\nFigure 1\n\nHeating expenditure relative to income by income decile\n\nIn percent\n\n \n\nLegend: In Scenario 1, the relative heating expenditure falls to about 20 percent for the houses with the lowest income (first decile) and the highest shares of heating costs (95th percentile).\n\nNote: Households are grouped according to their equivalent net household income in deciles and according to the amount of their relative heating expenditure in percentiles. \n\nSources: Authors’ calculations based on SOEP v.37, Federal Statistical office.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nThermal retrofits reduce energy costs expenditures and risks particularly for lower income households.\n\nBox\n\nCalculating the scenarios\n\nIt is assumed that two thirds of the retrofitted buildings un­\n\ndergo comprehensive retrofitting, analogous to the assump­\n\ntions in the long-term scenarios of the Federal Ministry for \n\nEconomic Affairs and Climate Action (Bundesministerium für \n\nWirtschaft und Klimaschutz, BMWK).1 The heating energy con­\n\nsumption of a single-family home is thus 55 kilowatt hours per \n\nsquare meter (kWh/sqm) and 40 kWh/sqm for a multi-family \n\nhome. In the case of partial retrofitting, we assume that the \n\nenergy consumption is reduced to 100 kWh/sqm for all build­\n\nings. A random selection is used to decide which 70 percent \n\nof the very inefficient buildings are retrofitted in Scenario 1 \n\nis depicted via random selection. In the reference year 2017, \n\nthe average heating prices were 0.06 euros/kWh;2 since then, \n\nprices have risen by 40 percent.3 During the same period, \n\nhowever, incomes only rose by 17 percent.4\n\n1 \n\nBundesministeriums für Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz, Hintergrundpapier zur Gebäude­\n\nstrategie Klimaneutralität 2045 (2022) (in German; available online).\n\n2 Puja Singhal and Jan Stede, “Wärmemonitor 2018: Steigender Heizenergiebedarf, Sani­\n\nerungsrate sollte höher sein,” DIW Wochenbericht no. 36 (2019) (in German; available online).\n\n3 Statistisches Bundesamt, Statistischer Bericht – Daten zur Energiepreisentwicklung – \n\nJanuar 2024 (2024) (in German; available online).\n\n4 Statistisches Bundesamt, Reallohnindex (2024) (in German; available online).\n\n142\n\nDIW Weekly Report 19/2024\n\nTHERMAL RETROFITTING\n\nowner-occupiers, landlords only benefit indirectly from heat­\n\ning cost savings through the modernization levy.\n\nHowever, the Worst-First approach offers more benefits \n\nbeyond the social components. For example, less gas would \n\nneed to be imported. If the current retrofitting rate of nearly \n\none percent was gradually increased to four percent over the \n\nnext three years and the retrofitting of very inefficient build­\n\nings was prioritized, around 14.4 percent of the German gas \n\ndemand in the building sector could be saved in this period.5\n\nThe Worst-First approach can also result in major heating \n\ncost savings. If the energy efficiency of 30 percent (or 43 per­\n\ncent in the second scenario) of buildings is improved, 34 \n\n(or 56) percent of heating costs could be saved.6 In general, \n\nbuildings with the worst energy efficiency offer the greatest \n\neconomic opportunities for retrofitting at both an individ­\n\nual and the societal level. It is important to prioritize these \n\nbuildings due to the limited capacity for construction and \n\nbuilding retrofitting and to achieve the targeted increase in \n\nthe annual retrofitting rate.\n\nUltimately, the heat supply must also become climate neu­\n\ntral to achieve climate neutrality in Germany by 2045. This \n\nrequires an extensive switch to heat pumps in buildings and \n\nfor district heating. Adequate energy efficiency of buildings \n\n5 Sophie M. Behr, Merve Kücük, and Karsten Neuhoff, \"Energetische Modernisierung von \n\nGebäuden sollte durch Mindeststandards und verbindliche Sanierungsziele beschleunigt werden,\" \n\nDIW akutell no. 87 (2023) (in German; available online).\n\n6 Calculated with the reduction in the median cost per square meter: Scenario 1 (11.04–\n\n16.8)/16.8*100 = –34.285714, Scenario 2: (7.41-16.8)/16.8*100 = –55.892857.\n\nalso increases the efficiency of heat pumps and leads to \n\nenergy savings that go beyond insulation. Reducing the max­\n\nimum heat requirement reduces the investment costs for \n\nheat pumps and the electricity system costs to cover peak \n\nelectricity demand during periods of cold weather.\n\nUncertain profitability of thermal retrofitting is a \n\nchallenge\n\nThermal retrofitting is often viewed as an investment risk. \n\nHigh-income households or households with real estate \n\nfunds with a larger investment portfolio can, in principle, \n\nmake profitable, albeit risky, investments more easily. For \n\nother households, the risks may be too great and result in \n\ninvestments not being made.7\n\nWhen a building undergoes general modernization, the costs \n\nof an additional thermal insulation compound system for \n\nwalls or more energy-efficient windows account for around \n\none third of the total retrofitting cost. Per square meter of \n\nliving space, additional investments in thermal moderniza­\n\ntion amount to 180 to 360 euros per square meter.8 On their \n\nown, the energy costs saved cannot justify the total invest­\n\nment costs of 600 to 700 euros per square meter.9 If retro­\n\nfitting or modernization measures are not necessary, a tar­\n\ngeted partial retrofitting is more cost effective. Insulation \n\nof the top floor and cellar ceilings is often an option and in \n\nmany buildings insulation material can be blown into the \n\ngap between the wall and the façade. Overall, this results \n\nin total costs of around 120 euros per square meter in sin­\n\ngle-family homes.10\n\nThe costs mentioned provide information about the profit­\n\nability of retrofitting as well as their amortization periods, \n\nbut both can vary significantly. Furthermore, lower energy \n\nprices or higher interest charges can prolong the amorti­\n\nzation period, which increases thermal retrofitting risks \n\n(Figure 3).\n\nIncrease subsidies for low-income homeowners\n\nCurrently, a combination of standards, incentives, and sub­\n\nsidies provide financial support for the thermal retrofitting \n\nof buildings (Figure 4). The Federal Funding for Efficient \n\nBuildings (Bundesförderung für effiziente Gebäude, BEG) funds \n\nboth comprehensive retrofitting measures for residential \n\nbuildings (BEG WG) as well as individual measures (BEG \n\n7 The effects of technical risks accumulate during implementation, as do energy price, real \n\nestate market, and financing risks.

Alternatively, individuals who pay income tax can write \n\noff 20 percent of the costs of measures and 50 percent of the \n\ncosts of specialist planning and construction monitoring.\n\nBoth subsidy programs maintain the relatively large incentive \n\nto retrofit very inefficient buildings because in these build­\n\nings more energy costs can be saved with comparable invest­\n\nment costs; subsidizing a portion of the investment costs with \n\nlow-interest loans or subsidies does not affect this. However, \n\nSOEP data show that the share of owner-occupiers with \n\nassets and income below the Wohngeld-Plus threshold who \n\nare living in very inefficient buildings is 40 percent higher \n\nthan for other homeowners.11 This indicates major chal­\n\nlenges in implementing retrofitting in this income bracket \n\nand is consistent with the relatively higher investment and \n\nfinancing risks for these households. Accordingly, a higher \n\nsubsidy rate12 or supplementary financing instruments (for \n\nexample subordinated loans) are necessary for the affected \n\nhouseholds, thirteen percent of all owner-occupied or six \n\n11 The share of homeowners below the Wohngeld-Plus threshold living in very inefficient build­\n\nings is 42 percent, around 40 percent higher compared to homeowners above the threshold, \n\nwhere the share is around 30 percent. Tax incentives are not attractive for homeowners with lower \n\nincomes who pay income taxes. However, they can take advantage of alternative subsidy pro­\n\ngrams and KfW loans.\n\n12 For example, MaPrimeRenovation, the French subsidy program for thermal building retrofit­\n\nting offers higher subsidy rates for low-income households (in French; available online).\n\npercent of all households (Figure 5).13 Since January 1, 2023, \n\nan additional ten percent repayment bonus has been avail­\n\nable through KfW loans for comprehensive retrofitting of \n\ninefficient buildings.\n\nHomeowners may face challenges in financing thermal ret­\n\nrofitting due to limited equity capital and the resulting lim­\n\nited access to additional debt capital. To ensure that thermal \n\ninvestment measures can nevertheless be implemented prof­\n\nitably in the longer term, granting subordinated and low-in­\n\nterest loans from KfW should be considered, or, for exam­\n\nple, providing residential building cooperatives with state-\n\nbacked equity capital for such investments.14\n\nCarbon cost distribution strengthens incentives \n\nto retrofit\n\nLandlords’ incentives to thermally retrofit buildings are lim­\n\nited, as tenants, not owners, usually carry the energy and car­\n\nbon costs and thus the related risks.

Such standards will apply to non-residential buildings \n\nacross the EU from 2032.20 Some countries, such as England \n\nand Wales, already have minimum standards for residential \n\nbuildings.21 Minimum energy performance standards have \n\nthe advantage that, as assumed in Scenario 2, all very inef­\n\nficient buildings are retrofitted and no households remain \n\nexposed to energy cost risks (Scenario 1).\n\nModernization levy should be designed to be rent \n\nneutral\n\nSince 2001, the modernization levy has allowed landlords to \n\npass on the costs of modernizing buildings to tenants.

To create retrofit­\n\nting incentives, the carbon costs from the German National \n\nEmissions Trading System have been split between tenants \n\nand landlords since 2023. The higher the carbon emissions \n\nper square meter, the greater the share of carbon costs car­\n\nried by the landlords. In buildings with carbon emissions of \n\nmore than 52 kg of CO2 per square meter per year, the share \n\nis 95 percent.15 However, there is a concern that the costs \n\nwill be passed on to tenants living in buildings not subject \n\nto rent control in the medium term.16\n\nEnsuring implementation with building standards\n\nIn 1977, the first thermal insulation requirements for newly \n\nconstructed buildings were defined in the Thermal Insulation \n\nRegulation (Wärmeschutzverordnung).17 The Buildings Energy \n\nAct (Gebäudeenergiegesetz, GEG) now also stipulates thermal \n\ninsulation requirements for existing buildings, for exam­\n\nple if more than ten percent of an exterior wall is modern­\n\nized.18 In addition, certain boilers must be replaced and the \n\n15 Kohlendioxidkostenaufteilungsgesetz (BGBl.

This limits incentives.\n\n17 Bundesgesetzblatt, Verordnung über einen energiesparenden Wärmeschutz bei Gebäuden \n\n(Wärmeschutzverordnung – WärmeschutzV) (1977) (in German; available online).\n\n18 GEG § 48.\n\nFigure 4\n\nIncentives, standards, and subsidy instruments for thermal retrofitting\n\n \n\nSource: Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control, (Bundesamt für Bundesamtes für Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle, BAFA); Fuel Emissions Trading Act (Brennstoffemissionshandelsgesetz, BEHG); Credit Institute for \n\nReconstruction (Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau, KfW); (Energetische Sanierungsmaßnahmen-Verordnung, ESanMV);\n\nauthors’ depiction.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nCurrently, there are no comprehensive minimum energy standards for existing buildings in Germany.\n\n145\n\nDIW Weekly Report 19/2024\n\nTHERMAL RETROFITTING\n\nof three euros per square meter per year can be passed on \n\nto tenants within six years.23\n\nTwenty-eight percent of all tenant households live in very \n\ninefficient buildings and have income and assets below the \n\nWohngeld-Plus threshold (Figure 5).24 For this reason, the \n\nGerman Expert Commission on Gas and Heat appointed by \n\nthe Federal Government recommended in 2022 that “state \n\nsupport should be designed in such a way that landlords can \n\nimplement an almost rent-neutral retrofitting” and that the \n\nmodernization levy should be adjusted accordingly.25\n\nThere are three advantages to reforming the modernization \n\nlevy with the goal of rent increases not surpassing the heat­\n\ning cost savings following thermal modernization meas­\n\nures. First, the incentives for a Worst-First approach would \n\nincrease because it is more profitable to retrofit rented build­\n\nings with higher potential energy savings. Second, land­\n\nlords’ motivation to use existing subsidy programs would \n\nincrease, as they would not be able to increase the rent by the \n\nnon-subsidized share of the investment costs, as is currently \n\nthe case. Third, financial support could be linked to proof \n\nof quality so that a certain energy level is actually achieved \n\nfollowing retrofitting.\n\nConclusion: Worst-First is a promising policy \n\napproach\n\nThe Worst-First approach is a promising policy strategy. It is \n\na social policy as it can protect highly burdened low-income \n\nhouseholds and tenants from high heating costs especially \n\nfrom energy price increases and has climate and energy pol­\n\nicy benefits. Limiting the modernization levy to the heating \n\ncosts saved does not only increase the acceptance among ten­\n\nants, but also supports the prioritization of retrofitting the \n\nleast efficient buildings.\n\nAlthough retrofitting entails certain risks for homeowners, \n\nit often pays off and could be further advanced by increased \n\nbuilding standards and targeted support for low-income \n\nhomeowners.

Behr, Merve Kücük, Maximilian Longmuir, and Karsten Neuhoff\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe pace of hermal retrofi of buildings in Germany remains \n\nslow. A Worst-Firs approach, prioritizing he retrofi of inef­\n\nficien buildings, would address energy- and social policy \n\nobjectives and deliver economic and climate benefits. Data \n\nfrom he German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) show how \n\nsuch an approach would protec especially low-income house­\n\nholds often living in very inefficien buildings from heating \n\ncosts risks. This group comprises 28 percen of all enants \n\nand 13 percen of all homeowners. Yet, uncertainty abou he \n\ncost-benefi of retrofi ing and other priorities of homeowners \n\nmean ha no enough buildings are retrofi ed. As a result, he \n\nsaving potentials, especially from very inefficien buildings, \n\nare no being realized. This would, however, be necessary o \n\nreduce heating cos risks and energy impor dependency, \n\nand o mee climate argets. Be er alignmen of financing and \n\nsubsidy instruments with he ownership structure, he further \n\ndevelopmen of building standards o include minimum \n\nenergy performance standards, and reform of enancy law \n\ncould improve he situation.\n\nThermal retrofi ing can effectively reduce high energy costs \n\nand cos risks due o energy price shocks.1 Low-income \n\nhouseholds ha currently live in very inefficien buildings2 \n\nand spend up o 30 percen of heir income on heating costs \n\nwould particularly benefi from such retrofits (Figure 1). The \n\nWorst-Firs approach, in which funding programs, building \n\nstandards, and other measures are designed o ensure ha \n\nvery inefficien buildings are retrofi ed first, would help \n\nthese households specifically. Energy cos subsidies such as \n\nWohngeld-Plus, which was expanded during he gas price cri­\n\nsis, or he climate dividend (Klimageld) discussed in relation \n\nto carbon prices, only partially address cos increases in very \n\ninefficien buildings, as he flat-rate payments do no cover \n\nthe higher cos burdens of inefficien homes.\n\nAlthough energy cos subsidies directly linked o heating or \n\ncarbon costs can mitigate he burden, hey lead o high fis­\n\ncal costs as hey reduce he incentives for investments in \n\nhigher energy efficiency. This dilemma can be addressed \n\nby accelerating he retrofi ing of very inefficien buildings, \n\nideally before another energy price crisis occurs, and as a \n\nresponse o he climate crisis and he high level of depend­\n\nency on energy imports.\n\nWorst-Firs approach as a social program\n\nWe use he German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) data \n\nto estimatete he heating cos distribution within income \n\ndeciles for he year 2024 and o compare i with wo scenar­\n\nios featuring accelerated retrofi ing of very inefficien build­\n\nings (Figure 1). The 2024 Energy Performance of Buildings \n\nDirective requires prioritizing hermal retrofi ing of he \n\n43 percen worst-performing residential buildings.3 Scenario \n\n1 assumes ha 70 percen of hese buildings are retrofit­\n\nted, which corresponds o 30 percen of all buildings. In \n\n1 \n\nKarsten Neuhoff, Maximilian Longmuir, Mats Kröger, and Franziska Schütze, “Hohe Gasprei­\n\nsanstiege: Entlastungen notwendig,” DIW Wochenberich no. 36 (2022) (in German; available on-\n\nline). Accessed on April 15, 2024. This applies o all other online sources in his report.\n\n2 In a European Parliamen draft, 43 percen of buildings with he highes heating energy con­\n\nsumption are considered inefficient. European Parliament, Energy performance of buildings (re­\n\ncast) (2024) (available online). This Weekly Repor refers o he buildings as “very inefficient.”\n\n3 European Parliament, Energy performance of buildings (recast) (2024) (available online).\n\n141\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 19/2024\n\nTHERMAL RETROFITTING\n\nScenario 2, all 43 percen of very inefficien buildings are \n\nretrofi ed (Box).\n\nThe scenario comparison shows ha he energy cos burden \n\nrelative o he income of households in all income brackets \n\nis starkly reduced when retrofi ing of very inefficien build­\n\nings is prioritized.\n\nHouseholds with very high shares of energy costs will ben­\n\nefi from his in particular. In Scenario 1, he heating cos \n\nexpenditure relative o he income falls from 19.8 percen \n\nto 15.5 percen for households with a particularly high cos \n\nburden in he second-lowes income decile (95th percen­\n\ntile). When all very inefficien buildings are retrofi ed as in \n\nScenario 2, he hea energy cos share drops o 11.6 percent.\n\nOur analysis shows ha enants are considerably more \n\naffected by poorly insulated buildings han homeowners. \n\nTenants, on average, pay higher heating costs per square \n\nmeter han homeowners in all income brackets (Figure 2). \n\nOn average, he energy condition of rental housing is worse \n\nthan owner-occupied housing, an intensively discussed opic \n\nin he literature known as he enant-landlord dilemma ha \n\nis a ributed o a number of factors.4 For example, unlike \n\n4 Jacob Ahlrich and Sebastian Rockstuhl, “Estimating fair ren increases after building retrofits: \n\nA max-min fairness approach,” Energy Policy 164 (2022): 112923; Martin Görnig and Katrin Klar­\n\nhöfer, “Investments in Energy-Efficien Building Renovation Are on a Downward Slide,” DIW Weekly \n\nRepor no. 32/33 (2023): 225–232 (available online).\n\nFigure 1\n\nHeating expenditure relative o income by income decile\n\nIn percent\n\n \n\nLegend: In Scenario 1, he relative heating expenditure falls o abou 20 percen for he houses with he lowes income (firs decile) and he highes shares of heating costs (95th percentile).\n\nNote: Households are grouped according o heir equivalen ne household income in deciles and according o he amoun of heir relative heating expenditure in percentiles. \n\nSources: Authors’ calculations based on SOEP v.37, Federal Statistical office.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nThermal retrofits reduce energy costs expenditures and risks particularly for lower income households.\n\nBox\n\nCalculating he scenarios\n\nI is assumed ha wo hirds of he retrofi ed buildings un­\n\ndergo comprehensive retrofi ing, analogous o he assump­\n\ntions in he long-term scenarios of he Federal Ministry for \n\nEconomic Affairs and Climate Action (Bundesministerium für \n\nWirtschaf und Klimaschutz, BMWK).1 The heating energy con­\n\nsumption of a single-family home is hus 55 kilowa hours per \n\nsquare meter (kWh/sqm) and 40 kWh/sqm for a multi-family \n\nhome. In he case of partial retrofi ing, we assume ha he \n\nenergy consumption is reduced o 100 kWh/sqm for all build­\n\nings. A random selection is used o decide which 70 percen \n\nof he very inefficien buildings are retrofi ed in Scenario 1 \n\nis depicted via random selection. In he reference year 2017, \n\nthe average heating prices were 0.06 euros/kWh;2 since hen, \n\nprices have risen by 40 percent.3 During he same period, \n\nhowever, incomes only rose by 17 percent.4\n\n1 \n\nBundesministeriums für Wirtschaf und Klimaschutz, Hintergrundpapier zur Gebäude­\n\nstrategie Klimaneutralitä 2045 (2022) (in German; available online).\n\n2 Puja Singhal and Jan Stede, “Wärmemonitor 2018: Steigender Heizenergiebedarf, Sani­\n\nerungsrate sollte höher sein,” DIW Wochenberich no. 36 (2019) (in German; available online).\n\n3 Statistisches Bundesamt, Statistischer Berich – Daten zur Energiepreisentwicklung – \n\nJanuar 2024 (2024) (in German; available online).\n\n4 Statistisches Bundesamt, Reallohnindex (2024) (in German; available online).\n\n142\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 19/2024\n\nTHERMAL RETROFITTING\n\nowner-occupiers, landlords only benefi indirectly from heat­\n\ning cos savings hrough he modernization levy.\n\nHowever, he Worst-Firs approach offers more benefits \n\nbeyond he social components. For example, less gas would \n\nneed o be imported. If he curren retrofi ing rate of nearly \n\none percen was gradually increased o four percen over he \n\nnex hree years and he retrofi ing of very inefficien build­\n\nings was prioritized, around 14.4 percen of he German gas \n\ndemand in he building sector could be saved in his period.5\n\nThe Worst-Firs approach can also resul in major heating \n\ncos savings. If he energy efficiency of 30 percen (or 43 per­\n\ncen in he second scenario) of buildings is improved, 34 \n\n(or 56) percen of heating costs could be saved.6 In general, \n\nbuildings with he wors energy efficiency offer he greates \n\neconomic opportunities for retrofi ing a both an individ­\n\nual and he societal level. I is importan o prioritize hese \n\nbuildings due o he limited capacity for construction and \n\nbuilding retrofi ing and o achieve he argeted increase in \n\nthe annual retrofi ing rate.\n\nUltimately, he hea supply mus also become climate neu­\n\ntral o achieve climate neutrality in Germany by 2045. This \n\nrequires an extensive switch o hea pumps in buildings and \n\nfor distric heating. Adequate energy efficiency of buildings \n\n5 Sophie M.

Reducing he max­\n\nimum hea requiremen reduces he investmen costs for \n\nhea pumps and he electricity system costs o cover peak \n\nelectricity demand during periods of cold weather.\n\nUncertain profitability of hermal retrofi ing is a \n\nchallenge\n\nThermal retrofi ing is often viewed as an investmen risk. \n\nHigh-income households or households with real estate \n\nfunds with a larger investmen portfolio can, in principle, \n\nmake profitable, albei risky, investments more easily. For \n\nother households, he risks may be oo grea and resul in \n\ninvestments no being made.7\n\nWhen a building undergoes general modernization, he costs \n\nof an additional hermal insulation compound system for \n\nwalls or more energy-efficien windows accoun for around \n\none hird of he otal retrofi ing cost. Per square meter of \n\nliving space, additional investments in hermal moderniza­\n\ntion amoun o 180 o 360 euros per square meter.8 On heir \n\nown, he energy costs saved canno justify he otal invest­\n\nmen costs of 600 o 700 euros per square meter.9 If retro­\n\nfi ing or modernization measures are no necessary, a ar­\n\ngeted partial retrofi ing is more cos effective. Insulation \n\nof he op floor and cellar ceilings is often an option and in \n\nmany buildings insulation material can be blown into he \n\ngap between he wall and he façade. Overall, his results \n\nin otal costs of around 120 euros per square meter in sin­\n\ngle-family homes.10\n\nThe costs mentioned provide information abou he profit­\n\nability of retrofi ing as well as heir amortization periods, \n\nbu both can vary significantly. Furthermore, lower energy \n\nprices or higher interes charges can prolong he amorti­\n\nzation period, which increases hermal retrofi ing risks \n\n(Figure 3).\n\nIncrease subsidies for low-income homeowners\n\nCurrently, a combination of standards, incentives, and sub­\n\nsidies provide financial suppor for he hermal retrofi ing \n\nof buildings (Figure 4).

Alternatively, individuals who pay income ax can write \n\noff 20 percen of he costs of measures and 50 percen of he \n\ncosts of specialis planning and construction monitoring.\n\nBoth subsidy programs maintain he relatively large incentive \n\nto retrofi very inefficien buildings because in hese build­\n\nings more energy costs can be saved with comparable invest­\n\nmen costs; subsidizing a portion of he investmen costs with \n\nlow-interes loans or subsidies does no affec his. However, \n\nSOEP data show ha he share of owner-occupiers with \n\nassets and income below he Wohngeld-Plus hreshold who \n\nare living in very inefficien buildings is 40 percen higher \n\nthan for other homeowners.11 This indicates major chal­\n\nlenges in implementing retrofi ing in his income bracke \n\nand is consisten with he relatively higher investmen and \n\nfinancing risks for hese households.

Tax incentives are no a ractive for homeowners with lower \n\nincomes who pay income axes. However, hey can ake advantage of alternative subsidy pro­\n\ngrams and KfW loans.\n\n12 For example, MaPrimeRenovation, he French subsidy program for hermal building retrofit­\n\nting offers higher subsidy rates for low-income households (in French; available online).\n\npercen of all households (Figure 5).13 Since January 1, 2023, \n\nan additional en percen repaymen bonus has been avail­\n\nable hrough KfW loans for comprehensive retrofi ing of \n\ninefficien buildings.\n\nHomeowners may face challenges in financing hermal ret­\n\nrofi ing due o limited equity capital and he resulting lim­\n\nited access o additional deb capital.

Second, land­\n\nlords’ motivation o use existing subsidy programs would \n\nincrease, as hey would no be able o increase he ren by he \n\nnon-subsidized share of he investmen costs, as is currently \n\nthe case. Third, financial suppor could be linked o proof \n\nof quality so ha a certain energy level is actually achieved \n\nfollowing retrofi ing.\n\nConclusion: Worst-Firs is a promising policy \n\napproach\n\nThe Worst-Firs approach is a promising policy strategy. I is \n\na social policy as i can protec highly burdened low-income \n\nhouseholds and enants from high heating costs especially \n\nfrom energy price increases and has climate and energy pol­\n\nicy benefits. Limiting he modernization levy o he heating \n\ncosts saved does no only increase he acceptance among en­\n\nants, bu also supports he prioritization of retrofi ing he \n\nleas efficien buildings.\n\nAlthough retrofi ing entails certain risks for homeowners, \n\ni often pays off and could be further advanced by increased \n\nbuilding standards and argeted suppor for low-income \n\nhomeowners. Minimum energy performance standards \n\ncould ensure all very inefficien buildings are retrofi ed \n\n23 BGB § 559.\n\n24 The 28 percen figure results from he fac ha 15 percen of households live in inefficien \n\nrental housing and are below he WohnGeld-Plus hreshold (Figure 5).
