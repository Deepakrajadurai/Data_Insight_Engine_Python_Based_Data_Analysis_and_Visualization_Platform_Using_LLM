    "Refugees send remi ances abroad less often han other migrants By Adriana Cardozo Silva and Sabine Zinn ABSTRACT Remi ances sen by refugees o heir home countries has been a hotly debated policy opic in Germany over he pas years and has led o he introduction of a paymen card for asylum applicants. This Weekly Repor investigates how he share of people living in Germany who send remi ances abroad has changed over ime according o heir migration background (with or withou a refugee background) and which factors influence he likelihood of remi ing. Based on Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) data as well as he IAB-SOEP Migration Samples and he IAB-BAMF-SOEP Refugee Survey from 2013 o 2022, he analysis shows ha migrants withou a refugee background send remi ances more often, while refugees are often rarely able o send remi ances due o structural barriers. Thus, he political debate does no reflec reality. A person’s family situation and heir intention o stay in Germany long erm are particularly importan factors influenc­ ing he likelihood ha hey will send remi ances abroad. In this respect, hese results should contribute o a reevaluation of remi ances, as hey are an importan instrumen in achiev­ ing sustainable developmen goals, in stabilizing he economy in he migrants’ home countries, and reducing poverty. In recen decades, he volume of he global flow of remit­ tances sen by migrants has grown significantly and reached historic peaks. According o World Bank data based on cal­ culations by central banks around he world, hese remit­ tance flows have developed into a significan income source for many low and middle-income countries. These personal transfers, referred o hereafter interchangeably as “personal transfers” or “remi ances,” help millions of families mee their basic needs and make an importan contribution o local economic development.1 Germany is also par of his global trend: Since he 2000s, he country has recorded a continu­ ing increase of remi ances sen abroad (Figure 1). By 2023, Germany was one of he op European nations in remit­ tances sent, reaching over 24 billion dollars (22 billion euros). This developmen reflects he change in migration ­dynamics tha Germany has experienced over he pas wo decades. Since 2000, he share of he population with a migration background2 has risen steadily. As of 2022, i was around 25 percen of he population, or around 21 million people. This increase is due both o he arrival of skilled migrants as well as of asylum seekers from crisis regions such as Syria, Afghanistan, and Ukraine. As of 2023, a new record of around 3.2 million asylum seekers are living in Germany.3 This situ­ ation reflects Germany’s humanitarian commitment, bu has also led o more debate on migration policy. Critical voices demand stricter regulations, especially regarding accepting asylum seekers. One key argumen in his discussion is he 1 Dilip Ratha et al., Remi ances Slowed in 2023, Expected o Grow Faster in 2024 (Washington, DC: World Bank, 2024) (available online. Accessed on November 2,",
    "2024. This applies o all other online sources in his repor unless stated otherwise). 2 This Weekly Repor does no differentiate between direc (born abroad) and indirec migration (a leas one paren born abroad) backgrounds. Instead, both groups are considered migrants. We only differentiate between non-migrants and migrants (with and withou a refugee background). The definition of migrants and heir offspring is based on differen characteristics ha are avail­ able in he SOEP dataset, such as country of birth, country of origin, year of migration, and oth­ er information abou heir migration, cf. Miriam Gauer and Cornelia Kristen, “A guide o using he SOEP for Research on Individuals of Immigran Origin: Samples and Contents of he SOEP-Core, Including he IAB-SOEP Migration Samples and he IAB-BAMF-SOEP Survey of Refugees, hrough a Migration and Immigran Integration Lens,” SOEP Survey Papers Series C., no. 1332 (2024) (avail­ able online.

This presumption has already led o concrete regulatory measures: For example, a paymen card system has been introduced, which limits asylum seekers’ access o disposable cash.4 The goal of his measure is o control he use of state subsidies more strictly and o ensure ha refu­ gees are mainly using his money o suppor hemselves in Germany.5 However, his debate ignores he positive effects tha remi ances sen abroad have on he recipien countries.6 The increase in remi ances and he related policy reactions emphasize he opic’s complexity: They illustrate how closely related economic aspects of migration and social policy chal­ lenges and public discourse are. While hese remi ances are of grea significance for he recipien countries, hos socie­ ties face he challenge of addressing unsubstantiated con­ cerns abou public funds flowing abroad, while also ensur­ ing suppor and integration for refugees. However, he aggregated figures published by he World Bank, which use Bundesbank data for Germany, do no pro­ vide any insigh into he amounts sen by migrants, especially refugees, and non-migrants (Box). Thus, a detailed analysis 4 Cf. he details on he paymen card on he German Federal Government's website (available online). 5 Herber Brücker, “Eine Einschätzung der Bezahlkarte für Geflüchtete,” BIM Policy Brief no. 2 (2024) (available online). 6 Hillel Rapopor and Frédéric Docquier, “The Economics of Migrants' Remi ances,” in Handbook of he Economics of Giving, Altruism, and Reciprocity, Vol. 2 (2006), 1135–1198 (available online). of remi ances sen only by migrants based on Bundesbank figures is no possible.7 Additionally, neither an individual’s specific contex nor heir motives for sending remi ances are recorded. This results in a certain unclarity, as he actual remi ance amounts of he",
    "individual groups canno be deter­ mined. Moreover, remi ances sen via informal channels are often no included or are underestimated, which further dis­ torts he overall figures.8 For a clearer understanding of who is sending remi ances under wha conditions, we mus analyze he rends in remit­ tances and he driving factors behind hem more closely. Such an analysis provides no only a look a he economic relationships and realities of migrants in Germany, bu also reveals wha motives and challenges are driving hem o send financial suppor o heir home countries. This closer look is decisive for making informed policy decisions and be er understanding he effects of migration and financial flows on societies, both sender and recipien countries. This analysis is he firs o use representative, longitudi­ nal survey data from private households in Germany o 7 Jörg Feuerhake and Maria Pia Cobián, Personal ransfers in he balance of payments: estima­ tion under changing migration pa erns (Bank für Internationalen Zahlungsausgleich, Irving Fisher Commi ee on Central Bank Statistics: 2024) (available online). 8 Informal channels include unregulated methods, such as he Hawala system in which ransac­ tions are done on a rus basis, or having cash physically ransported by a courier service. Infor­ mal channels are often faster and more affordable, bu carry risks such as money laundering and a lack of consumer protection. Official channels are regulated by financial institutions such as banks, money ransfer services (such as Western Union), or mobile financial services (such as M-Pesa). Cf.

Box Method of calculation and international remi ance data International remi ance statistics, as reported in he International Financial Statistics of he International Monetary Fund (IMF), follow the Balance of Payments manual (BPM6) methodology and divide transfers into wo main categories:1 • Compensation of Employees (CE): Includes he income of em­ porary migran workers, such as seasonal workers. The gross income including he employer’s social security contributions is recorded. • Personal ransfers (PT): Includes all monetary or in-kind rans­ fers sen abroad by people living in Germany, independen of their relationship o he recipient.2 In Germany, ransfer data is mainly collected via banks. Transfers of smaller amounts (under 12,500 euros) and informal remi ances are frequently no included, which can resul in he actual remit­ tance volume being underestimated. In addition, he data can include remi ances made by Germans withou a migration back­ ground. Furthermore, here are challenges in recording informal and digital remi ances. SOEP data and methodology The German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) data used in his Weekly Repor can provide some of his more detailed informa­ tion for Germany. SOEP is a representative and multidisciplinary household survey encompassing around 15,00 households (Version 39) ha has been conducted every year since 1984. The analysis is limited o he years 2013 o 2022 o explicitly record he survey waves of he IAB-SOEP Migration Samples as well as he IAB-BAMF-SOEP Refugee Survey.3 Including hese studies creates a representative population sample of people with migration and refugee backgrounds, which reflects he migration dynamics of he 1 Andrea Friedrich, Jens Walter, and Birgi Zeitschel, The German remi ance market – an over­ view (Deutsche Bundesbank: 2007) (in German; available online). 2 International Monetary Fund, Balance of Payments and International Investmen Position ­Manual.

The following question is asked in all samples: “Did you send money or other financial suppor o relatives or other people outside of your house­ hold in he las year (20xx)? If yes, wha was he otal amoun you transferred in 20xx? Where does he recipien live?” The possible answer categories for recipien are:",

This way, respondents can indicate tha hey sen ransfers o relatives abroad as well as o relatives living in Germany. This makes i possible o record he remi ance practices of respondents comprehensively while considering he differen locations of he recipients. A distinction is made between personal ransfers made exclusively within Germany and personal ransfers abroad for he analysis in this Weekly Report. However, he survey does no provide more exac information on wha specific countries he remi ances are being sen o. Based on his definition, his Weekly Repor focuses on people who have sen remi ances abroad o one or more of he recipients mentioned. As is well known in research, remi ance amounts reported by respondents are often incomplete and subjec o underreporting and inaccuracies.5 A detailed analysis of hese values requires a complex method of multiple imputation, which is beyond he scope of his Weekly Report. Therefore, he presen analysis focuses on if a person has sen a remi ance abroad or not, withou aking full accoun of how much was sent. 4 cf.

In essence, there are hree main motives for sending remi ances: altru­ ism, strategic or investmen reasons, and social and cul­ tural bonds.12 These motivations can overlap and reflec dif­ feren needs and circumstances, which can vary depend­ ing on he migrants’ individual situation and he nature of their migration. Altruistic motives A key motive for sending remi ances is altruism, he desire to suppor relatives in need. This motive drives more remit­ tances during crisis periods in migrants’ home countries in particular, when families are faced with economic challenges, political instability, or natural disasters. In such cases, remit­ tances are vital aid o secure basic needs such as food, medi­ cal care, and education.13 This form of assistance is common among both migrants withou a refugee background as well as refugees, although he la er may be under particular pres­ sure o provide financial suppor due o heir refugee situ­ ation and he often precarious situation of heir families.14 Strategic or investmen motives Remi ances are strategic investments for some migrants, especially hose who are economically stable. Remi ances are used o acquire or maintain assets in heir home coun­ try, such as real estate or family businesses. Generally, he goal is o secure long-term sources of income or o ensure a possible return.15 This is generally a",
    "motive for migrants withou a refugee background, who, unlike refugees, end o have a secure work situation and hus can use heir financial resources o plan for long-term investments in heir home country.16 Favorable investmen conditions, such as changes in exchange rates or low interes rates or ransaction costs, can also stimulate his ype of personal ransfer. Social and cultural bonds In addition o economic motives, remi ances are also sen to maintain a connection o one’s home country or o live up o familial or cultural expectations. For many migrants, regularly sending remi ances strengthens no only familial 12 Frédéric Docquier, Hillel Rapoport, and Sara Salomone, “Remi ances, migrants' education and immigration policy: Theory and evidence from bilateral data,” Regional Science and Urban ­Economics 42, no. 5 (2012): 817–828. 13 Cynthia Bansak and Brian Chezum, “How Do Remi ances Affec Human Capital Formation of School-Age Boys and Girls?” American Economic Review 99, no. 2 (2009): 145–148 (available online.

Nevertheless, refugees often find hemselves in a dilemma: Although hey have strong familial ies, financial limitations in heir hos country can limi he amoun and regularity of remi ances. Migrants send remi ances abroad more often than refugees To understand he heoretical motives for remi ing in practice, we firs describe he developmen of he share of people who send personal ransfers abroad using SOEP data from 2013 to 2022. Next, statistical models shed ligh on he characteris­ tics ha are associated with a higher likelihood of remi ing. Although remi ances abroad are mainly associated with migrants, non-migrants (Germans withou a migration background) also send personal ransfers o other coun­ tries. In recen years, between hree and four percen of all people living in Germany sen remi ances abroad (Figure 2), as well as around 1.5 percen of non-migrants. However, SOEP data only provide limited information on he amounts non-migrants send abroad or for wha specific reasons hey are remi ing. I is unclear whether hey send remi ances 17 Anna Lindley, “The early-morning phonecall: Remi ances from a refugee diaspora perspec­ tive,” Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies 35, no. 8 (2009) (available online).

These results correlate with he strategic and investmen motives described in he literature, which are often accompanied by altruistic motives. The decline of remi ances sen by migrants withou a ­refugee background between 2013 and 2016 coincides with the increase in asylum seekers in Europe in 2015 and 2016, when around 1.3 million refugees, mainly from Syria, came to Germany.18 The German population’s increased altruistic commitmen o refugees during his period could explain why fewer migrants sen remi ances abroad.19 The share of refugees who send remi ances abroad is lower than he share of migrants withou a refugee background who remi abroad. From 2013 o 2016, here was a steady decrease from 15 o seven percen (Figure 4). The share of refugees sending remi ances abroad declined in 2015 and 2016 in par­ ticular, similar as o other migrants. Between 2017 and 2020 the share stabilized a around en percen before falling down to seven percen in 2021. Presumably, his upward rend can be explained by economic and job-related difficulties, which many people faced during he coronavirus pandemic.20 The trend suggests ha while refugees wan o maintain strong social bonds and cultural ies o heir home countries and suppor heir families, heir economic situation limits heir ability o remi regularly. Men, small households, and divorcees send remi ances abroad more frequently To understand why people send remi ances abroad, he following section utilizes wo statistical models o investi­ gate he personal and familial factors ha can influence he likelihood of remi ing. In he firs model, variables such as gender, level of education, household size, number of children, marital status, and life satisfaction are considered (Figure 5). The models differentiate between non-migrants (Germans withou a migration background) and migrants (migrants withou a refugee background and refugees). The results show ha migrants are 2.1 percentage points more likely o send remi ances abroad han non-migrants, while refugees are 2.7 percentage points less likely o send remit­ tances han non-migrants. This is in line with studies ha show ha refugees are often subjec o greater economic restrictions, which limits heir ability o send remi ances.21 18 Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung, Demografie von Asylsuchenden in Deutschland (2024) (in German; available online). 19 Chang Woon Nam and Peter Steinhoff, “The Role of Volunteers in German Refugee Crisis and Their Contribution o he Local Governmen Expenditure,” CESifo Working Paper No. 73",

Remi ances can be sent, for example, o suppor children studying abroad. For migrants withou a refugee background, here is a clear upward rend: Since 2016, he share of his group sending remi ances abroad has grown continually, increasing from eigh percen o nearly 12 percen in 2021 (Figure 3).

Studies on gender-specific remi ance practices sugges ha women migrants often face major economic barriers and have spe­ cific ­familial obligations ha limi heir ability o earn an income and hus o remit.22 Income differences in particular explain why women, even if hey wan o suppor heir fami­ lies abroad, send less frequently as well as smaller amounts than men.23 Level of education only shows a small influence on remit­ tance behavior, which is consisten with he mixed evidence in he research. Some studies sugges ha be er educated migrants remi less frequently, as hey had already been liv­ ing in more stable economic situations due o heir qualifica­ tions in heir home countries before hey left, and hey expe­ rience less pressure o suppor heir family.24 Their families are possibly more financially secure and less dependen on regular remi ances. Other studies sugges ha less educated migrants",
    "remi more frequently, especially if heir families are experiencing economic difficulties or hey migrated o Germany primarily o financially provide for heir family.25 Household size also influences remi ance behavior: With every additional household member, he likelihood of a remit­ tance declines by 0.4 percentage points, which indicates more financial obligations within a larger household. Marital status is also an influential factor: Widows and widowers, divorcees, and people who are separated are more likely o send remit­ tances han married people. This is likely due o a strong feel­ ing of responsibility for relatives living abroad or being geo­ graphically separated from family members. These results are consisten with he research ha emphasizes he sig­ nificance of he family structure for remi ance behavior.26 Intention o return o home country influences remi ances The second model differentiates between migrants withou a refugee background and refugees. Additional factors, such as the intention o stay in Germany permanently and a strong bond o he home country, are investigated (Figure 6). I can be seen ha migrants who plan o live in Germany perma­ nently send remi ances abroad less often. This indicates tha a long-term intention o stay in Germany is associated with a greater prioritization of investments in Germany.27 In 22 Elke Holst, Andrea Schäfer, and Mechthild Schrooten, “Gender, Transnational Networks and Remi ances: Evidence from Germany,” DIW Discussion Paper no. 1005 (2010) (available online). 23 Rahel Kunz and Julia Maisenbacher, “Gender and remi ances,” in The Palgrave Handbook of Gender and Migration (2021), 321–338 (available online). 24 Docquier, Rapoport, and Salomone, “Remi ances, migrants' education and immigration ­policy.” 25 Richard H.

These findings contribute o a be er understanding of he complex motives and differen living conditions of migrants in Germany. 28 Tineke Fokkema, Eralba Cela, and Elena Ambrose i, “Giving from he hear or from he ego?

On he one hand, his find­ ing exposes he contradictory nature of he political debate, which focuses on remi ances sen by refugees and resulted in he introduction of he paymen card system in various fed­ eral states, among other hings, withou empirical evidence of its benefits. Secondly, his finding emphasizes he need for a more in-depth analysis o shed ligh on he connections between remi ances and he specific, diverse living condi­ tions of migrants (such as heir differen employmen situ­ ations). For such an analysis, data collection on remi ances mus also be improved, as central banks in particular often fail o adequately record informal financial flows. Advanced techniques, such integrating differen data sources and mul­ tiple imputation, could provide more accurate figures and thus create a reliable basis for economic policy decisions. Furthermore, i is crucial o recognize he value of remit­ tances as an informal bu importan form of economic sup­ port.29 Remi ances abroad, which are often sen for personal reasons, contribute significantly o he economic stability of families in low and middle-income countries according to studies. Remi ances are often more effective han finan­ cial resources from developmen cooperation, as hey reach those in need directly withou losing money due o bureau­ cracy or corruption. In his way, remi ances make an impor­ tan contribution o reducing poverty and economic resil­ ience.30 Migrants’ remi ances abroad can be considered a driving force in promoting he United Nations Sustainable Developmen Goals (SDGs), as hey improve he living con­ ditions of families and communities. Remi ances make i possible for migrants o suppor heir families back home, an action in line with he SDG framework,31 which empha­ sizes he righ of every person o freely spend heir income, regardless of where heir relatives live. Reevaluating he role of remi ances could help be er focus policy measures on supporting remi ances and heir func­ tion as a direc developmen instrument.32 Targeted suppor of he economic integration of refugees would be a deci­ sive step in strengthening heir financial independence and improving heir ability o suppor",
    "heir families abroad. This would strengthen heir economic resilience as well as he positive effec of he remi ances o heir home countries. 29 In accordance with he United Nations’ Sustainable Developmen Goals, Germany has commit­ ted o providing 0.7 percen of its GDP for formal developmen aid each year. In 2022, he arge was even slightly exceeded, as 0.85 percen of GDP was provided. I should be noted ha all governmen spending on refugees during heir firs year of residence is also included in he calculation, cf. infor­ mation on he website of he Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Developmen (Bundes­ ministerium für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbei und Entwicklung, BMZ) (in German; available online). 30 Richard H.
