Behr, Merve Kücük, Maximilian Longmuir, and Karsten Neuhoff ABSTRACT The pace of hermal retrofi of buildings in Germany remains slow. A Worst-Firs approach, prioritizing he retrofi of inef­ ficien buildings, would address energy- and social policy objectives and deliver economic and climate benefits. Data from he German Socio-Economic",
    "Panel (SOEP) show how such an approach would protec especially low-income house­ holds often living in very inefficien buildings from heating costs risks. This group comprises 28 percen of all enants and 13 percen of all homeowners. Yet, uncertainty abou he cost-benefi of retrofi ing and other priorities of homeowners mean ha no enough buildings are retrofi ed. As a result, he saving potentials, especially from very inefficien buildings, are no being realized. This would, however, be necessary o reduce heating cos risks and energy impor dependency, and o mee climate argets. Be er alignmen of financing and subsidy instruments with he ownership structure, he further developmen of building standards o include minimum energy performance standards, and reform of enancy law could improve he situation. Thermal retrofi ing can effectively reduce high energy costs and cos risks due o energy price shocks.1 Low-income households ha currently live in very inefficien buildings2 and spend up o 30 percen of heir income on heating costs would particularly benefi from such retrofits (Figure 1). The Worst-Firs approach, in which funding programs, building standards, and other measures are designed o ensure ha very inefficien buildings are retrofi ed first, would help these households specifically. Energy cos subsidies such as Wohngeld-Plus, which was expanded during he gas price cri­ sis, or he climate dividend (Klimageld) discussed in relation to carbon prices, only partially address cos increases in very inefficien buildings, as he flat-rate payments do no cover the higher cos burdens of inefficien homes. Although energy cos subsidies directly linked o heating or carbon costs can mitigate he burden, hey lead o high fis­ cal costs as hey reduce he incentives for investments in higher energy efficiency. This dilemma can be addressed by accelerating he retrofi ing of very inefficien buildings, ideally before another energy price crisis occurs, and as a response o he climate crisis and he high level of depend­ ency on energy imports. Worst-Firs approach as a social program We use he German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) data to estimatete he heating cos distribution within income deciles for he year 2024 and o compare i with wo scenar­ ios featuring accelerated retrofi ing of very inefficien build­ ings (Figure 1). The 2024 Energy Performance of Buildings Directive requires prioritizing hermal retrofi ing of he 43 percen worst-performing residential buildings.3 Scenario 1 assumes ha 70 percen of hese buildings are retrofit­ ted, which corresponds o 30 percen of all buildings.

This applies o all other online sources in his report. 2 In a European Parliamen draft, 43 percen of buildings with he highes heating energy con­ sumption are considered inefficient.

    "DIW Weekly Repor 19/2024 THERMAL RETROFITTING Scenario 2, all 43 percen of very inefficien buildings are retrofi ed (Box). The scenario comparison shows ha he energy cos burden relative o he income of households in all income brackets is starkly reduced when retrofi ing of very inefficien build­ ings is prioritized. Households with very high shares of energy costs will ben­ efi from his in particular. In Scenario 1, he heating cos expenditure relative o he income falls from 19.8 percen to 15.5 percen for households with a particularly high cos burden in he second-lowes income decile (95th percen­ tile). When all very inefficien buildings are retrofi ed as in Scenario 2, he hea energy cos share drops o 11.6 percent. Our analysis shows ha enants are considerably more affected by poorly insulated buildings han homeowners. Tenants, on average, pay higher heating costs per square meter han homeowners in all income brackets (Figure 2). On average, he energy condition of rental housing is worse than owner-occupied housing, an intensively discussed opic in he literature known as he enant-landlord dilemma ha is a ributed o a number of factors.4 For example, unlike 4 Jacob Ahlrich and Sebastian Rockstuhl, “Estimating fair ren increases after building retrofits: A max-min fairness approach,” Energy Policy 164 (2022): 112923; Martin Görnig and Katrin Klar­ höfer, “Investments in Energy-Efficien Building Renovation Are on a Downward Slide,” DIW Weekly Repor no. 32/33 (2023): 225–232 (available online).

Box Calculating he scenarios I is assumed ha wo hirds of he retrofi ed buildings un­ dergo comprehensive retrofi ing, analogous o he assump­ tions in he long-term scenarios of he Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (Bundesministerium für Wirtschaf und Klimaschutz, BMWK).1 The heating energy con­ sumption of a single-family home is hus 55 kilowa hours per square meter (kWh/sqm) and 40 kWh/sqm for a multi-family home. In he case of partial retrofi ing, we assume ha he energy consumption is reduced o 100 kWh/sqm for all build­ ings. A random selection is used o decide which 70 percen of he very inefficien buildings are retrofi ed in Scenario 1 is depicted via random selection. In he reference year 2017, the average heating prices were 0.06 euros/kWh;2 since hen, prices have risen by 40 percent.3 During he same period, however, incomes only rose by 17 percent.4 1 Bundesministeriums für Wirtschaf und Klimaschutz, Hintergrundpapier zur Gebäude­ strategie Klimaneutralitä 2045 (2022) (in German; available online). 2",

However, he Worst-Firs approach offers more benefits beyond he social components. For example, less gas would need o be imported. If he curren retrofi ing rate of nearly one percen was gradually increased o four percen over he nex hree years and he retrofi ing of very inefficien build­ ings was prioritized, around 14.4 percen of he German gas demand in he building sector could be saved in his period.5 The Worst-Firs approach can also resul in major heating cos savings. If he energy efficiency of 30 percen (or 43 per­ cen in he second scenario) of buildings is improved, 34 (or 56) percen of heating costs could be saved.6 In general, buildings with he wors energy efficiency offer he greates economic opportunities for retrofi ing a both an individ­ ual and he societal level. I is importan o prioritize hese buildings due o he limited capacity for construction and building retrofi ing and o achieve he argeted increase in the annual retrofi ing rate. Ultimately, he hea supply mus also become climate neu­ tral o achieve climate neutrality in Germany by 2045. This requires an extensive switch o hea pumps in buildings and for distric heating. Adequate energy efficiency of buildings 5 Sophie M.

Reducing he max­ imum hea requiremen reduces he investmen costs for hea pumps and he electricity system costs o cover peak electricity demand during periods of cold weather. Uncertain profitability of hermal retrofi ing is a challenge Thermal retrofi ing is often viewed as an investmen risk. High-income households or households with real estate funds with a larger investmen portfolio can, in principle, make profitable, albei risky, investments more easily. For other households, he risks may be oo grea and resul in investments no being made.7 When a building undergoes general modernization, he costs of an additional hermal insulation compound system for walls or more energy-efficien windows accoun for around one hird of he otal retrofi ing cost. Per square meter of living space, additional investments in hermal moderniza­ tion amoun o 180 o 360 euros per square meter.8 On heir own, he energy costs saved canno justify he otal invest­ men costs of 600 o 700 euros per",
    "square meter.9 If retro­ fi ing or modernization measures are no necessary, a ar­ geted partial retrofi ing is more cos effective. Insulation of he op floor and cellar ceilings is often an option and in many buildings insulation material can be blown into he gap between he wall and he façade. Overall, his results in otal costs of around 120 euros per square meter in sin­ gle-family homes.10 The costs mentioned provide information abou he profit­ ability of retrofi ing as well as heir amortization periods, bu both can vary significantly. Furthermore, lower energy prices or higher interes charges can prolong he amorti­ zation period, which increases hermal retrofi ing risks (Figure 3). Increase subsidies for low-income homeowners Currently, a combination of standards, incentives, and sub­ sidies provide financial suppor for he hermal retrofi ing of buildings (Figure 4). The Federal Funding for Efficien Buildings (Bundesförderung für effiziente Gebäude, BEG) funds both comprehensive retrofi ing measures for residential buildings (BEG WG) as well as individual measures (BEG 7 The effects of echnical risks accumulate during implementation, as do energy price, real estate market, and financing risks.

Alternatively, individuals who pay income ax can write off 20 percen of he costs of measures and 50 percen of he costs of specialis planning and construction monitoring. Both subsidy programs maintain he relatively large incentive to retrofi very inefficien buildings because in hese build­ ings more energy costs can be saved with comparable invest­ men costs; subsidizing a portion of he investmen costs with low-interes loans or subsidies does no affec his. However, SOEP data show ha he share of owner-occupiers with assets and income below he Wohngeld-Plus hreshold who are living in very inefficien buildings is 40 percen higher than for other homeowners.11 This indicates major chal­ lenges in implementing retrofi ing in his income bracke and is consisten with he relatively higher investmen and financing risks for hese households.

However, hey can ake advantage of alternative subsidy pro­ grams and KfW loans. 12 For example, MaPrimeRenovation, he French subsidy program for hermal building retrofit­ ting offers higher subsidy rates for low-income households (in French; available online). percen of all households (Figure 5).13 Since January 1, 2023, an additional en percen repaymen bonus has been avail­ able hrough KfW loans for comprehensive retrofi ing of inefficien buildings. Homeowners may face challenges in financing hermal ret­ rofi ing due o limited equity capital and he resulting lim­ ited access o additional deb capital. To ensure ha hermal investmen measures can nevertheless be implemented prof­ itably in he longer erm, granting subordinated and low-in­ teres loans from KfW should be considered, or, for exam­ ple, providing residential building cooperatives with state- backed equity capital for such investments.14 Carbon cos distribution strengthens incentives to retrofit Landlords’ incentives o hermally retrofi buildings are lim­ ited, as enants, no owners, usually carry he energy and car­ bon costs and hus he related risks.

To create retrofit­ ting incentives, he carbon costs from he German National Emissions Trading System have been spli between enants and landlords since 2023. The higher he carbon emissions per square meter, he greater he share of carbon costs car­ ried by he landlords. In buildings with carbon emissions of more han 52 kg of CO2 per square meter per year, he share is 95 percent.15 However, here is a concern ha he costs will be passed on o enants living in buildings no subjec to ren control in he medium erm.16 Ensuring implementation with building standards In 1977, he firs hermal insulation requirements for newly constructed buildings were defined in he Thermal Insulation Regulation (Wärmeschutzverordnung).17 The Buildings Energy Ac (Gebäudeenergiegesetz, GEG) now also stipulates hermal insulation requirements for existing buildings, for exam­ ple if more han en percen of an exterior wall is modern­ ized.18 In addition, certain boilers mus be replaced and he 15 Kohlendioxidkostenaufteilungsgesetz (BGBl.

First, he incentives for a Worst-Firs approach would increase because i is more profitable o retrofi rented build­ ings with higher potential energy savings. Second, land­ lords’ motivation o use existing subsidy programs would increase, as hey would no be able o increase he ren by he non-subsidized share of he investmen costs, as is currently the case. Third, financial suppor could be linked o proof of quality so ha a certain energy level is actually achieved following retrofi ing. Conclusion: Worst-Firs is a promising policy approach The Worst-Firs approach is a promising policy strategy. I is a social policy as i can protec highly burdened low-income households and enants from high heating costs especially from energy price increases and has climate and energy pol­ icy benefits. Limiting he modernization levy o he heating costs saved does no only increase he acceptance among en­ ants, bu also supports he prioritization of retrofi ing he leas efficien buildings. Although retrofi ing entails certain risks for homeowners, i often pays off and could be further advanced by increased building standards and argeted suppor for low-income homeowners. Minimum energy performance standards could ensure all very inefficien buildings are retrofi ed 23 BGB § 559. 24 The 28 percen figure results from he fac ha 15 percen of households live in inefficien rental housing and are below he WohnGeld-Plus hreshold (Figure 5).

The expec­ tation ha Germany migh also introduce standards creates incentives for owners o already ake corresponding efficiency requirements into accoun now in modernization measures. Minimum energy performance requirements could also be added as requiremen o existing suppor programs, for example for hea pumps. The persisten lack of predictability is a challenge for policy­ makers, homeowners, and industry, which is why he scale of retrofi ing declined even during he energy crisis.26 As he Worst-Firs approach has both social policy and economic policy advantages, i could help build societal and political suppor for building retrofi policies. 26 Martin Gornig und Katrin Klarhöfer, \"Investments in energy-efficien building renovation are on a downward slide,\" DIW Weekly Repor no. 32/33 (available online).
