This Weekly Report provides an overview of the \n\nshort- and long-term goals as well as current developments \n\nand trends in France’s energy and climate policy. It reveals \n\nthat France is largely on track with its greenhouse gases \n\ntargets and is also making good progress on installing heat \n\npumps. However, its expansion of renewable energy capac­\n\nities is falling short. Differences in the energy policies of \n\nFrance and Germany are most apparent in the power sector: \n\nWhile France is prioritizing nuclear power, Germany is relying \n\nheavily on renewable energy. For France to achieve its climate \n\ngoals, it will have to expand renewable energy faster. One \n\nchallenge faced by both countries is their planned electrifica­\n\ntion of mobility and space heating.\n\nFrance’s energy policy is currently undergoing an update \n\nprocess. A new climate bill for the next five years is to be \n\nadopted in the coming months. A strategy paper, relevant \n\nfor future planning in the energy sector, was published at \n\nthe end of November 2023 and opened to public consulta­\n\ntion (Box). This Weekly Report outlines the energy policy \n\ngoals and measures of the French government and com­\n\npares them with progress made so far using selected indi­\n\ncators. It also highlights the individual similarities and dif­\n\nferences with the energy transition in Germany.1\n\nMixed results for overarching goals so far\n\nAs with Germany, France’s energy and climate policy goals \n\nare geared to European requirements. Implementation of \n\nthe European Fit for 55 package2 is particularly important \n\nhere. It includes more ambitious targets for reducing green­\n\nhouse gas emissions and increasing the share of renewable \n\nenergy in Europe.3\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions targets are currently \n\nbeing mostly met\n\nAt the European level, the goal is to make the EU climate \n\nneutral by 2050. In addition, according to the latest revised \n\ntargets, net greenhouse gas emissions4 must now be reduced \n\nto 55 percent of 1990 levels by 2030.5 In France, the goal of \n\nbecoming climate neutral by 2050 has been enshrined in \n\n1 \n\nOn the German energy transition, see Wolf-Peter Schill, Alexander Roth, and Adeline Guéret, \n\n“Ampel-Monitor Energiewende shows the pace of the energy transition must be accelerated signif­\n\nicantly,” DIW Weekly Report, no. 27 (2022): 371–379 (available online; accessed on January 8, 2024. \n\nThis applies to all other online sources in this report unless stated otherwise); up-to-date figures \n\nand diagrams are available on the Ampel-Monitor Energiewende website at any time (in German; \n\navailable  online).\n\n2 European Commission, “Fit for 55: Delivering on the proposals,” (2023) (available online).\n\n3 The following charts and further analyses, including those relating to energy efficiency targets \n\nand other aspects, such as green hydrogen, are provided in the Open Energy Tracker (available \n\nonline).

The new EU target for \n\n2030 has not yet been implemented in France. For 2030, it \n\nstill plans to cut gross emissions by 40 percent over 1990 lev­\n\nels. This target also forms the basis of the current emissions \n\nbudget. For the period 2015 to 2018, the target was 442 million \n\ntons of CO2 equivalent (MtCO2-eq) per year. At an average of \n\n6 Légifrance, Article L100-4 of the French Energy Code (2023) (available online).\n\n456 million tons of CO2 equivalent per year, this target was \n\nnot met during the four years in question (Figure 1).7\n\nThe second emissions budget, which relates to the five-year \n\nperiod from 2019 to 2023, sets an upper limit on gross green­\n\nhouse gas emissions of 421 million tons of CO2 equivalent \n\n7 Centre interprofessionnel technique d’études de la pollution atmosphérique (CITEPA), Tableau \n\nde bord des engagements climat, (2024) (available online). See also Haut Conseil pour le Climat \n\n(HCC), Rapport annuel (2023): 65 (available online).\n\nBox\n\nLegislative framework for the energy transition in France\n\nA cornerstone of the legislative framework for the energy transi­\n\ntion in France is the act on the energy transition for green growth \n\n(Loi relative à la transition énergétique pour la croissance verte1) \n\nfrom August 17, 2015. This law was passed in the run-up to the UN \n\nClimate Change Conference (COP21) that took place in Paris in \n\nDecember 2015. This act made it mandatory among other things, \n\nfor the French government to develop a national decarbonization \n\nstrategy (Stratégie Nationale Bas Carbone,2 SNBC) for the first \n\ntime as well as a multi-annual energy program (Programmation \n\nPluriannuelle de l’Énergie,3 PPE). Both programs contain quanti­\n\ntative targets for a series of subsectors. They are intended to help \n\nFrance reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, become more ener­\n\ngy efficient, and increase its share of renewable energy.\n\nThe decarbonization strategy (SNBC) sets out a long-term goal for \n\ngreenhouse gas emissions and short-term emissions budgets for \n\nthree successive five-year periods. These budgets set upper limits \n\nfor total greenhouse gas emissions that may not be exceeded in \n\nthe respective period. The strategy must be revised every five \n\nyears, whereby one part of the upper limit set in the previous strat­\n\negy must be amended and a new upper limit proposed for the next \n\nfive-year period. The first SNBC set an emissions limit for the peri­\n\nods from 2015 to 2018,4 from 2019 to 2023, and from 2024 to 2028. \n\nThe second SNBC revised the upper limit set for the period from \n\n2019 to 2023 and from 2024 to 2028, and introduced a new upper \n\nlimit for the period from 2029 to 2033. The third SNBC should cur­\n\nrently being drafted by the government.\n\nThe multi-annual energy program (PPE) is based on a similar \n\nprinciple. It sets out plans for two five-year periods and is reviewed \n\n1 \n\nLégifrance, Loi no 2015-992 du 17 août 2015 relative à la transition énergétique pour la \n\n croissance verte, 2022 (available online).\n\n2 Ministère de la Transition écologique et solidaire, Stratégie Nationale Bas Carbone (2020) \n\n(available online).\n\n3 Ministère de la Transition écologique et solidaire, Programmation Pluriannuelle de l’Energie \n\n(2020) (available online).\n\n4 The first SNBC was revised from 2018 to 2019 due to the adoption of the Energy and  Climate \n\nAct and the new climate neutrality target. As a result, the first budget only covers four years \n\n instead of five.\n\nevery five years. It sets targets specifically for the energy sector, \n\nwith a lower and an upper target value being defined in each case.\n\nSome provisions of the act from 2015 were amended by the \n\nEnergy and Climate Act5 of November 8, 2019.6 Since then, it \n\nhas represented another cornerstone of France’s energy and \n\nenvironmental policy. In particular, it led to the government being \n\nmandated to pass a law every five years (Loi de programmation \n\n quinquennale sur l'économie et le climat), which sets out in detail \n\nthe targets and priorities of its energy and climate policy for the \n\nnext five years. The first five-year law should have been adopted \n\nby July 1, 2023,7 but the government did not meet this deadline. \n\nThe new French energy and climate strategy (SFEC)8 was pub­\n\nlished only on November 22, 2023. This strategy contains, among \n\nother things, quantitative targets that are likely to be included \n\nin the next multi-annual energy program (PPE3). At the end of \n\nDecember, the first draft version of the energy sovereignty act was \n\npublished, which is intended to serve as the energy block of the \n\npreviously mentioned first five-year law.9\n\nAfter President Emmanuel Macron was re-elected in May 2022, \n\ntwo different ministries were responsible for energy and envi­\n\nronmental issues: The Ministry for the Energy Transition and \n\nthe Ministry of Ecological Transition and Territorial Cohesion. In \n\naddition, a General Secretariat for Ecological Planning was set up, \n\nwhich reports directly to the Prime Minister. After the government \n\nreshuffle on January 9, 2024, the Ministry for the Energy Transition \n\nwas suppressed , and the energy portfolio was transferred to the \n\nMinistry of Economy and Finance.\n\n5 Légifrance, Loi no 2019-1147 du 8 novembre 2019 relative à l’énergie et au climat (2019) \n\n( available online).\n\n6 The objectives and provisions provided for in the various energy-related laws are summarised \n\nin the French Energy Code. If a law amends certain objectives that were provided for in a previous \n\nlaw, the corresponding article of the Energy Code is amended (available online).\n\n7 Légifrance, Article L100-1 A of the French Energy Code (2023) (available online)\n\n8 Ministère de la Transition Énergétique, Stratégie Française pour l’Energie et le Climat (2023) \n\n(available online)\n\n9 Thomas Chemel, “Comment l’avant-projet de loi de souveraineté énergétique détricote les \n\n objectifs climatiques,” Contexte, January 4, 2024 (available online).\n\n34\n\nDIW Weekly Report 4+5/2024\n\nFRENCH ENERGY TRANSITION\n\nper year.8 This corresponds to around 6.5 tons per person. \n\nThis is considerably less than in Germany, whose emissions \n\namounted to around nine tons per capita in 2022. Between \n\n2020 and 2022, gross emissions in France remained below \n\nthe emissions budget. However, these findings should be \n\ninterpreted with caution since both the COVID-19 pandemic \n\nand the energy price crisis occurred in this period, which led \n\nto a significant reduction in energy consumption and there­\n\nfore emissions. Furthermore, net greenhouse gas emissions \n\nin 2019 and 2021 were above the indicative yearly limits set. \n\nThis is due to, among other things, the fact that the reduc­\n\ntion in greenhouse gases from forestry was less than planned. \n\nOverall, net emissions in France were therefore slightly above \n\nthe target in the period from 2015 to 2021 (more recent data \n\nis not yet available).9\n\n8 Ministère de la Transition Énergétique, Ajustement technique des budgets carbone (2022) \n\n(available online).\n\n9 Haut Conseil pour le Climat (HCC), Rapport annuel (2023): 65 (available online).\n\nThe decarbonization strategy (SNBC) also contains an esti­\n\nmate of emissions budgets by sector, which are consistent \n\nwith the overall five-year budget. However, this breakdown \n\nis only indicative. One sector can emit more if this is off­\n\nset by a greater reduction in emissions in another sector, as \n\nlong as the overall budget is respected. In contrast, Germany \n\nhas so far had targets for each sector. However, the current \n\ndraft amendment to the Climate Protection Act will allow \n\nonly one overall target to apply in future, similar to France.10\n\nWith around 129 million tons of CO2 equivalent per year \n\nfor the period from 2019 to 2023, the transport sector has \n\nthe largest emissions budget. It is historically also the sec­\n\ntor that has produced the most emissions. It is followed by \n\nthe budget for agriculture (80 million tons CO2 equivalent \n\n10 German Bundestag, “Homepage on the amendment to the Climate Protection Act,” (2023) (in \n\nGerman; available online).\n\nFigure 1\n\nFrance’s greenhouse gas emissions and emissions budgets by sector\n\nIn millions of tons of CO2 equivalent\n\n \n\n1 LULUCF: Land use, land-use change, and forestry\n\n2 SNBC: National decarbonization strategy\n\nSource: CITEPA (Secten) (available online), PNEC2023 (available online), Ministère de la Transition Énergétique (available online). Here, the emissions budgets presented in the Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan are \n\nconsidered to be those of the SNBC-3.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nFrance sets its emissions reduction targets in five-year budgets.\n\n35\n\nDIW Weekly Report 4+5/2024\n\nFRENCH ENERGY TRANSITION\n\nper annum), buildings (77 million tons CO2 equivalent) and \n\nindustry (75 million tons CO2 equivalent). The energy sec­\n\ntor is the sector with the second-lowest emissions budget \n\nafter waste.11 The buildings and transport sectors will have \n\nto reduce their emissions the most: by around 45 and 30 per­\n\ncent respectively when comparing 2019 levels to the 2029–\n\n2033 period.\n\nSectoral emissions and sectoral targets in France differ \n\ngreatly from those in Germany. In Germany, energy has \n\ntraditionally accounted for the highest share of total emis­\n\nsions, which is primarily due to the high level of coal-fired \n\npower generation. It is followed by industry, as Germany has \n\na particularly large amount of energy-intensive industry, and \n\nthen by the transport and buildings sectors.\n\nThe implementation of new European targets for reduc­\n\ning net greenhouse gas emissions of at least 55 percent by \n\n2030 will lead to a downward correction of France’s emis­\n\nsions budgets for the years 2024 to 2028 and for 2029 to \n\n2034. The Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for \n\nFrance,12 which was submitted to the European Commission \n\nfor review in October 2023, sets out an average emissions \n\nbudget for the period from 2024 to 2028 (2029 to 2034), which \n\nis six percent (14 percent) lower than in the current decar­\n\nbonization strategy.\n\nRenewable energy share too low\n\nThe European Renewable Energy Directive from 2009 con­\n\ntained binding targets for the share of renewable energy in \n\ngross final energy consumption for all Member States for \n\nthe year 2020. The target for France was 23 percent, while for \n\nGermany it was 18 percent. However, France only achieved \n\n19.2 percent and, as a result, was the only country in the EU \n\nto miss its target for 2020 (Figure 2).13\n\nThe most important renewable energy sources in France are \n\nrenewable solid biomass and residential waste used for heat \n\ngeneration (32 percent of renewable gross final energy con­\n\nsumption in 2022), followed by hydroelectric power (18 per­\n\ncent). Heat pumps, wind power, and biofuels each account \n\nfor around ten to 14 percent of gross final energy consump­\n\ntion from renewable energy sources.14 In Germany, biomass \n\nfor heat generation has a similar share of energy supply from \n\nrenewable energy sources as it does in France; in contrast, the \n\n11 Ministère de la Transition Énergétique, Ajustement technique des budgets carbone (2022) \n\n(available online).\n\n12 European Commission, France – Draft Updated NECP 2021–2030 (2023) (available online).\n\n13 Ministère de la Transition Écologique et de la Cohésion des Territoires, Service des données \n\net études statistiques, “Les énergies renouvelables en France en 2022 – Suivi de la directive (UE) \n\n2018/2001 relative à la promotion de l’utilisation des énergies renouvelables,” (2023) (available \n\nonline); and European Commission, “Assessment of the draft updated National Energy and Climate \n\nPlan of France,” 3 (2023) (available online).\n\n14 Ministère de la Transition Écologique et de la Cohésion des Territoires, Service des données \n\net études statistiques, “Les énergies renouvelables en France en 2022 – Suivi de la directive (UE) \n\n2018/2001 relative à la promotion de l’utilisation des énergies renouvelables,” (2023) (available \n\n online).\n\nshare of wind and solar energy in Germany is much higher \n\nand the share of hydroelectric power is significantly lower.15\n\nTo implement current EU requirements, the French Energy \n\nand Climate Act of 2019 sets a target of at least 33 percent \n\nof renewable energy in gross final energy consumption by \n\n2030.16 In 2022, this share was 20.7 percent;17 in Germany \n\nit was 20.8 percent. After the EU target was increased from 32 \n\nto 42.5 or even 45 percent,18 France is also expected to adjust \n\nits targets for 2030 accordingly. However, its recently submit­\n\nted plan contains no adjustment of its targets so far. Instead, \n\nit sets a target for the share of carbon-free energy sources, \n\nwhich include nuclear power as well as renewable energy.19\n\nReducing fossil fuel consumption\n\nIn contrast to Germany, France has set explicit targets for \n\nreducing the consumption of primary fossil fuels. By 2030, \n\nit aims to have reduced its consumption by 40 percent over \n\n2012 levels. This will require a considerable reduction in cur­\n\nrent consumption trends.20\n\n15 Umweltbundesamt, “Erneuerbare Energien in Zahlen,” (2023) (in German; available online).\n\n16 Légifrance, Article L100-4 of the French Energy Code (available online).\n\n17 The data for 2022 are preliminary.

This share has risen stead­\n\nily since 2015, from just under 19 percent in 2015 to 28 per­\n\ncent in 2022.26 However, the trend for the years from 2020 \n\nto 2022 should be interpreted with caution, as 2022 was in \n\nmany respects an exceptional year for the French electricity \n\nsystem because generation from nuclear and hydroelectric \n\npower plants was historically low. In Germany, the targets \n\nfor renewable energy are significantly higher. The aim is to \n\nachieve a share of at least 80 percent of renewable energy in \n\ngross electricity consumption by 2030.\n\nGrowth in photovoltaics\n\nFor the photovoltaics sector, France’s multi-annual energy \n\nprogram (PPE) sets a target of 20.1 gigawatts (GW) of installed \n\ncapacity for 2023 and between 35.1 and 44 GW for 2028. By \n\nthe end of September 2023, there were 18.3 GW of installed \n\ncapacity, and no new data has been available since. This \n\nmeans that 1.8 GW would have to have been added between \n\nSeptember and December 2023 for this target to have been \n\nachieved, which is the equivalent of more than what has \n\nbeen installed in the first three quarters of 2023. It can be \n\nassumed that this target will not be achieved. Nevertheless, \n\nexpansion of the photovoltaics industry since the beginning \n\nof 2021 has accelerated significantly and the trend over the \n\npast 12 months is significantly above that of the past five years \n\n(Figure 4). The first draft of the third  multi-annual energy \n\nprogram contains even higher targets of 54 to 60 GW in 2030 \n\nand 75 to 100 GW in 2035.\n\nIn comparison, Germany has an installed capacity of over \n\n80 GW from photovoltaics. It plans to increase this figure \n\nto 215 GW by 2030 and to 309 GW by 2035. Relative to cur­\n\nrent population, the targets for 2035 in France correspond to \n\naround 1.1 to 1.5 kilowatt (kW) per capita. At around 3.7 kW \n\nper person, Germany’s target for 2035 is around three times \n\nhigher.\n\nSlow expansion of onshore wind power\n\nFor onshore wind power plants, the current plans sets capac­\n\nity targets of 24.1 GW for 2023 and 33.2 to 34.7 GW by 2028. \n\nAt the end of September 2023, installed capacity amounted \n\nto 21.9 GW and was therefore 2.2 GW below the target that \n\nshould have been achieved three months later. As a result, \n\nthe target is likely to be missed. In contrast to photovoltaics, \n\ngrowth in onshore wind energy has not accelerated recently, \n\n25 RTE, “Annual Electricity Review 2022,” (2024) (available online); cf. also Umweltbundesamt, \n\n Entwicklung der spezifischen Treibhausgas-Emissionen des deutschen Strommix in den Jahren \n\n1990–2022, (2023) (in German, available online).\n\n26 Ministère de la Transition Écologique et de la Cohésion des Territoires, Service des données \n\net études statistiques, “Chiffres des des énergies renouvelables – Edition 2023,” (2023) (available \n\n online).\n\nTargets in the power sector\n\nIn 2023, nuclear power generated around 65 percent of \n\nFrance’s electricity, followed by hydropower with 12 per­\n\ncent (Figure 3). Wind power and solar energy recently grew \n\nto ten and four percent of power generation, respectively. \n\nThe total share of renewable energy in overall power gener­\n\nation was 18 percent. Coal- and gas-fired power plants con­\n\ntinued on a downward trend and accounted for just under \n\nseven percent of power generation in 2023 (compared to \n\nten percent in 2007).21 In 2023, only just over one percent of \n\nelectricity generation in Germany came from nuclear power \n\nplants, while over half came from renewable energy sources. \n\nCoal- and gas-fired power plants together accounted for just \n\nunder 42 percent.22\n\nAnnual power generation in France (527 to 550 terawatt \n\nhours (TWh) in the period from 2000 to 2021) is usually well \n\nabove annual consumption (425 to 499 TWh),23 which makes \n\nit a net exporter of electricity.24 The only exception was in 2022 \n\nwhen France became a net importer due to a temporary out­\n\nage of a large portion of its nuclear power plants. Due to its \n\nhigh share of nuclear power, France’s carbon intensity of the \n\npower mix is relatively small. Generated electricity emitted \n\nless than 50 grams of CO2 per kilowatt hour.

It is therefore essen­\n\ntial to speed up the pace of expansion to achieve targets for \n\n2028. This applies all the more if the increased targets from \n\n33 to 35 GW of installed capacity by 2030 (and 40 to 45 GW \n\nby 2035) set out in the latest French energy and climate strat­\n\negy (SFEC) are to be achieved.\n\nIn comparison, Germany currently has an installed capac­\n\nity of around 61 GW from onshore wind power. This figure \n\nshould rise to 115 GW by 2030 and to 157 GW by 2035. The \n\nFrench target for 2035 corresponds to around 0.6 to 0.7 kW \n\nper capita; Germany’s target is around 1.9 kW per capita.\n\nFrance’s foray into offshore wind power\n\nThe expansion of offshore wind power in France began in \n\nthe second quarter of 2022 with the commissioning of its \n\nfirst offshore wind farm off the coast of Saint-Nazaire with \n\na capacity of 480 MW. Two further farms were connected to \n\nthe grid by the end of 2023, increasing installed capacity to \n\naround 1.5 GW. However, this development will not be suffi­\n\ncient to achieve the target of 2.4 GW of installed capacity set \n\nfor 2023. Hence, France first needs to make up a shortfall of \n\naround one GW; it must then install a further 2.8 GW within \n\nfive years in order to achieve the lower target of 5.2 GW by \n\n2028. To reach the upper target of 6.2 GW, around three \n\ntimes as much capacity as what has been installed to date \n\nwould need to be added by the end of 2028. The new target \n\nrecently proposed for 2030 of four GW is actually slightly \n\nbelow the lower target of the current multi-annual program \n\nplan; however, it is aiming to achieve much stronger growth \n\nup to 18 GW by 2035.\n\nIn comparison, Germany currently has an installed capacity \n\nof a good eight GW from offshore wind power. The plan is \n\nto reach 30 GW by 2030 and 40 GW just five years after that. \n\nIn terms of targets per capita, France’s new goal for 2035 is \n\nequivalent to 0.3 kW per capita, while in Germany this fig­\n\nure is nearly 0.5 kW.\n\nChanging course on nuclear power\n\nThe 2015 legislation set a target for reducing the nuclear \n\npower share in total electricity generation for the first time. It \n\nwas to be gradually reduced from 76 percent in 2015 to 50 per­\n\ncent by 2025. This target was then amended by the Energy \n\nand Climate Act of 2019, which pushed the target year back \n\nto 2035. In the end, this target was abandoned completely.27 \n\nThe upper limit of 63.2 GW for total nuclear power gener­\n\nation capacity was also abandoned. This legislative amend­\n\nment reflects the vision of French President Emmanuel \n\nMacron and his government of an energy transition28 in \n\n27 Légifrance, “Loi n°2023-491 du 22 juin 2023 relative à l’accélération des procédures liées à la \n\nconstruction de nouvelles installations nucléaires à proximité de sites nucléaires existants et au \n\nfonctionnement des installations existantes,” (2023) (available online).\n\n28 Emmanuel Macron outlined this vision, in particular, in his speech in Belfort on February 10, \n\n2022 (available online).\n\nFigure 4\n\nInstalled renewable energy capacity in France\n\nIn gigawatts\n\n \n\nNote: PPE2: second multi-annual energy program.

In contrast, Germany completely phased out \n\nnuclear power in April 2023.\n\nTransport sector: different trends in biofuels and \n\nelectromobility\n\nDue to the transport sector’s high share in total GHG emis­\n\nsions, measures in this area are key to France’s climate pol­\n\nicy. Passenger vehicles, which account for more than half \n\nof greenhouse gas emissions in this sector, are particularly \n\nimportant.29\n\nIn France there are around 39 million passenger vehicles30 \n\ncompared to around 49 million in Germany. The per capita \n\nfigure is almost the same for both countries, with around \n\n590 cars for France and 580 cars for Germany per 1,000 \n\ninhabitants.\n\nStagnation in biofuels\n\nFrance aims to achieve a 15-percent share of renewable \n\nenergy in transport fuel consumption by no later than 2030. \n\nIn 2022, it achieved a share of nearly nine percent.31 Biodiesel \n\nmade up around 72 percent of that figure followed by bioeth­\n\nanol with 27 percent.32 Compared along a linear target path \n\nbetween 2015 and 2030, the share recently achieved was \n\n2.5 percentage points too low.33 In addition, the trend in \n\nrecent years has been stagnant or even downward. The use \n\nof biofuels has also been stagnating for years in Germany. \n\nInstead, both countries intend to rely heavily on electromo­\n\nbility in the future.\n\nElectromobility: modest targets achieved\n\nThe multi-annual energy program also includes specific \n\ntargets for the number of all-electric vehicles and plug-in \n\nhybrid passenger cars as well as for the number of publicly \n\naccessible charging points between 2023 and 2028. The plan \n\nis to have 660,000 all-electric vehicles and 500,000 plug-in \n\nhybrid passenger cars by the end of 2030;34 these numbers \n\nare supposed to grow to three million vehicles and 1.8 mil­\n\nlion passenger vehicles, respectively, by 2028. The total num­\n\nber of all-electric vehicles exceeded one million at the end of \n\n29 Ministère de la Transition Écologique et de la Cohésion des Territoires, Service des données et \n\nétudes statistiques, “Chiffres clés des transports – Edition 2023,” (2023) (available online).\n\n30 The most recent data are from January 1, 2023 (available online).\n\n31 Ministère de la Transition Écologique et de la Cohésion des Territoires, Service des données et \n\nétudes statistiques 1, “Chiffres clés des transports – Edition 2023,,” (2023) (available online).

One of these measures was the “ecological bonus” for \n\npurchasing a new or used electric vehicle (up to 7,000 euros) \n\nand a “conversion bonus” for purchasing a low emission \n\nvehicle if a less environmentally friendly vehicle is taken out \n\nof service (up to 6,000 euros).37 In addition, a tax must be \n\npaid when a vehicle is first registered if the vehicle is classi­\n\nfied as environmentally harmful (known as the “ ecological \n\n penalty”).38 The level of the tax depends on how environ­\n\nmentally harmful the purchased vehicle is. Since January \n\n2024, there has also been a social leasing offer for house­\n\nholds under a certain income threshold and who have a suf­\n\nficiently long commute. It allows them to lease an electric \n\nvehicle for 100 euros per month.39\n\nGermany has a target of 15 million all-electric battery pow­\n\nered passenger vehicles by 2030. Currently, there are only \n\n1.4 million such vehicles on the road in Germany. Using a \n\nlogistic progression path, indicative intermediary targets \n\nfor 2023 and 2028 are around 1.8 million and then 10.1 mil­\n\nlion electric cars, respectively. These targets are significantly \n\nhigher than those in France, but the actual growth in num­\n\nbers is currently lagging behind the target path.40 In terms \n\nof current passenger vehicle numbers, the French target \n\nfor 2028 corresponds to a share of just under eight percent \n\nfor all-electric vehicles. In Germany, the derived target for \n\n2028 produces a corresponding share of just under 21 per­\n\ncent, and the 15 million electric cars envisaged by 2030 cor­\n\nrespond to a share of just under 31 percent.\n\nThe target for publicly accessible charging points was set \n\nat 100,000 by 202341 and 400,000 by 2030 (including 50,000 \n\nfast-charging points).42 This target for 2023 was already \n\nachieved in May of 2023. By the end of 2023, there were \n\nalready 118,000 publicly accessible charging points in France, \n\nof which around 20,000 were fast-charging points with an \n\npower rating of more than 22 kW.43\n\n35 Avère France, “[Baromètre] Décembre 2023: le cap du millionième véhicule électrique est \n\nfranchi!” (2024) (available online).\n\n36 This figure may also include plug-in hybrids that are not passenger vehicles.\n\n37 Ministère de la Transition Énergétique, “Prime à la conversion des véhicules et Bonus \n\nécologique 2023,” (2024) (available online).\n\n38 Passenger vehicles with CO2 emissions of more than 117 grammes per kilometre (available \n\n online).\n\n39 Ministère de la Transition Énergétique, “Prime à la conversion des véhicules et Bonus \n\nécologique 2023,” (2024) (available online)\n\n40 Cf.

According to the most recently available \n\ndata, it has nearly 100,000 charging points.44 That is fewer \n\nthan in France, despite it having a larger number of electric \n\ncars on the road.\n\nBuildings: high energy consumption, but \n\ncomparatively low emissions\n\nBuildings in France are responsible for almost half of final \n\nenergy consumption,45 almost two thirds of which is from \n\nresidential buildings. However, the buildings sector only \n\naccounted for around 18 percent of greenhouse gas emis­\n\nsions in 2021 due to a high proportion of electric heating.46 \n\nIn 2021, more than a third of main residential buildings that \n\nyear used electricity as their main source of energy for heat­\n\ning (including just under eight percent with heat pumps).47 \n\nIn Germany, space heating accounts for a slightly smaller \n\nshare of final energy consumption than in France, at just \n\nunder one third.48 However, in 2022, heat pumps and stor­\n\nage heaters accounted for a significantly lower share of all \n\ndomestic heating systems in Germany at just under six and \n\ntwo percent respectively.49\n\nFrance’s strategy for reducing emissions in the buildings \n\nsector is based on further electrifying its heating systems \n\nand banning technologies with high emissions. In addition, \n\nenergy consumption is to be reduced through improved \n\nbuilding insulation. Since January 2023, new rental contracts \n\nfor apartments in existing buildings can only be concluded \n\nif they meet a certain energy efficiency level.50 Furthermore, \n\nthe installation of heating systems that emit more than 300 \n\ngrams of CO2 equivalent per kilowatt hour has been prohib­\n\nited since July 1, 2022, which means a de facto ban on the \n\ninstallation of new oil-fired boilers.51 Besides, the installation \n\nof natural gas heating systems in new single-family homes \n\nhas been prohibited since 2022. They will also be banned in \n\nnew apartment buildings from 2025. France was consider­\n\ning reducing the emissions ceiling from 300 to 150 grams of \n\nCO2 equivalent per kilowatt hour.

Cf. Légifrance, “Décret n°2021–19 du 11 janvier 2021 relatif au critère de \n\nperformance énergétique dans la définition du logement décent en France métropolitaine,”  (2021) \n\n(available online).\n\n51 Légifrance, “Décret n°2022-8 du 5 janvier 2022 relatif au résultat minimal de performance \n\n environnementale concernant l’installation d’un équipement de chauffage ou de production d’eau \n\nchaude sanitaire dans un bâtiment,” (2022) (available online).\n\nin a ban on the installation of new gas boilers.52 However, \n\nthe idea was abandoned in summer 2023.\n\nGermany’s coalition government (SPD/FDP/Greens) had \n\noriginally set out plans in its coalition agreement that, from \n\n2025, it would only allow new heating systems that are pow­\n\nered by at least 65 percent renewable energy. This start date \n\nwas to be brought forward by one year, but after lengthy dis­\n\ncussions relating to the Buildings Energy Act, it is now being \n\npostponed. Gas or oil heating systems may now continue to \n\nbe installed in existing buildings until a heating plan is avail­\n\nable in the respective municipality, which may take until June \n\n2028 depending on the municipality.53\n\nStrong growth of renewable energy in the heating \n\nsector\n\nBy 2030, France aims to achieve a 38 percent share of renew­\n\nable energy in gross final energy consumption for heating \n\nand cooling. In 2022, that share was 27.2 percent. The larg­\n\nest contribution was made by heating with wood in house­\n\nholds (40 percent of energy consumption for heating and \n\ncooling from renewable energy sources), followed by heat \n\npumps (27 percent), and biomass excluding wood (23 per­\n\ncent).54 The share achieved was therefore slightly below the \n\nfigure expected from a linear target path between 2015 and \n\n2030.55 However, the recent trend has been dynamic with \n\nthe share of renewable energy rising from 21.4 percent in \n\n2018 to 27.2 percent in 2022. If France can keep this pace \n\nup until 2030, it will achieve its target of 38 percent for that \n\nyear. The increase was largely due to the expansion of heat \n\npump installation, which progressed much faster in France \n\nthan in Germany. One reason for the lower uptake of heat \n\npumps in Germany is likely its higher household electric­\n\nity prices. Furthermore, natural gas was long regarded as a \n\n“bridge fuel” in Germany, and the installation of new nat­\n\nural gas heating systems was even subsidized there until \n\nrecently. In France, heat pumps have been subsidized for \n\nsome time now.\n\nThe multi-annual energy program sets out specific goals \n\nfor annual heat generation from heat pumps. The target for \n\n2023 is just under 40 TWh per year, of which 35 TWh is to be \n\nprovided by air-source heat pumps and just under five TWh \n\nby geothermal heat pumps.56 In 2022, total heat generation \n\nfrom heat pumps amounted to 42.7 TWh (weather-adjusted \n\nto 47.6 TWh), which is well above the target. The main rea­\n\nson for this development was the recent significant increase \n\n52 Gouvernement français, Dossier de concertation – Accélérer la décarbonation du secteur du \n\nbâtiment (2023): 29 (available online).\n\n53 For a more in-depth discussion on heat pumps and the Buildings Energy Act, cf. episodes 7 \n\nto 9 of the fossilfrei podcast (in German; available online).\n\n54 Ministère de la Transition Écologique et de la Cohésion des Territoires, Service des données et \n\nétudes statistiques, “Les énergies renouvelables en France en 2022 – Suivi de la directive (UE)\n\n2018/2001 relative à la promotion de l’utilisation des énergies renouvelables,” (2023) (available \n\n online).\n\n55 The corresponding visualization can be found on the Open Energy Tracker (available online).\n\n56 Article 4 of Decree No. 2020-456 dated April 21, 2020, on multi-annual energy planning \n\n( available online).\n\n40\n\nDIW Weekly Report 4+5/2024\n\nFRENCH ENERGY TRANSITION\n\nappears to be meeting its targets, mainly due to the strong \n\nexpansion of heat pumps.\n\nIt has not, however, met its renewable energy targets and \n\nprogress over the last five years, particularly in the transport \n\nsector, is not very encouraging. In general, France is behind \n\non all its targets to expand photovoltaics and onshore and \n\noffshore wind power. It is instead relying on nuclear power. \n\nThis is a political decision, which clearly underlines the “éco­\n\nlogie à la française” under Macron’s presidency.59,60 However, \n\nif its targets for renewable energy are to be achieved, it will \n\nneed to expand its wind and solar power plants significantly.\n\nAlthough there are differences in the energy policy goals of \n\nFrance and Germany, there are also similarities. Greenhouse \n\ngas emissions are already significantly lower in France, but \n\nGermany is aiming to go climate neutral five years before \n\nFrance. In terms of mobility and space heating, both coun­\n\ntries are focusing on electrification. While Germany’s targets \n\nfor electromobility are more ambitious, the number of elec­\n\ntric cars and charging infrastructure clearly needs to grow \n\nfaster in both countries. France is currently making faster \n\nprogress than Germany on expanding heat pumps.\n\nThe differences are greatest in the electricity sector: While \n\nFrance is prioritizing nuclear power,61 Germany is relying \n\nheavily on renewable energy. France is also aiming to use \n\nmore wind power and solar energy over the long term, but \n\nat a considerably lower level.\n\nIt would make sense for France to expand renewable energy \n\nfaster. This would not only allow it to achieve its targets for \n\nrenewable energy, which it has not met, but it would also help \n\nthe country meet its climate goals and safeguard against the \n\nrisks of using nuclear power. If there are further problems \n\nwith existing power plants in the future or delays in con­\n\nstructing new reactors, an additional, increased expansion \n\nof renewable energy would be helpful. The risk that France \n\nwould generate “too much” emission-free power as a result, \n\nappears to be low considering the strong growth in demand \n\nfor renewable electricity expected in Europe.\n\n59 Which can be translated in English as a kind of “made in France ecology.”\n\n60 Cf.

In Germany, the annual increase in heat pumps \n\nis considerably lower. In 2022, only 236,000 heat pumps were \n\ninstalled;57 half a million new heat pumps are expected to be \n\ninstalled each year from 2024.\n\nConclusion: Positive and negative developments \n\nin the French energy transition\n\nFrance’s energy and climate policy comprises a large num­\n\nber of short-, medium-, and long-term targets that are revised \n\nin five-year, structured planning processes. However, the \n\nFrench government is now behind schedule: France’s new \n\nfive-year law on energy and climate strategy should have \n\nbeen adopted at latest on July 1, 2023. An initial draft bill \n\nwas submitted at the end of 2023 but was immediately crit­\n\nicized for its lack of specific targets for renewable energy.58\n\nFrance currently appears to be largely on track to reduce its \n\ngross greenhouse gas emissions, although this is certainly \n\nalso due to the unique effects of the COVID-19 pandemic \n\nand the energy price crisis.

This Weekly Repor provides an overview of he \n\nshort- and long-term goals as well as curren developments \n\nand rends in France’s energy and climate policy. I reveals \n\ntha France is largely on rack with its greenhouse gases \n\ntargets and is also making good progress on installing hea \n\npumps. However, its expansion of renewable energy capac­\n\nities is falling short. Differences in he energy policies of \n\nFrance and Germany are mos apparen in he power sector: \n\nWhile France is prioritizing nuclear power, Germany is relying \n\nheavily on renewable energy. For France o achieve its climate \n\ngoals, i will have o expand renewable energy faster. One \n\nchallenge faced by both countries is heir planned electrifica­\n\ntion of mobility and space heating.\n\nFrance’s energy policy is currently undergoing an update \n\nprocess. A new climate bill for he nex five years is o be \n\nadopted in he coming months. A strategy paper, relevan \n\nfor future planning in he energy sector, was published a \n\nthe end of November 2023 and opened o public consulta­\n\ntion (Box). This Weekly Repor outlines he energy policy \n\ngoals and measures of he French governmen and com­\n\npares hem with progress made so far using selected indi­\n\ncators. I also highlights he individual similarities and dif­\n\nferences with he energy ransition in Germany.1\n\nMixed results for overarching goals so far\n\nAs with Germany, France’s energy and climate policy goals \n\nare geared o European requirements. Implementation of \n\nthe European Fi for 55 package2 is particularly importan \n\nhere. I includes more ambitious argets for reducing green­\n\nhouse gas emissions and increasing he share of renewable \n\nenergy in Europe.3\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions argets are currently \n\nbeing mostly met\n\nA he European level, he goal is o make he EU climate \n\nneutral by 2050. In addition, according o he lates revised \n\ntargets, ne greenhouse gas emissions4 mus now be reduced \n\nto 55 percen of 1990 levels by 2030.5 In France, he goal of \n\nbecoming climate neutral by 2050 has been enshrined in \n\n1 \n\nOn he German energy ransition, see Wolf-Peter Schill, Alexander Roth, and Adeline Guéret, \n\n“Ampel-Monitor Energiewende shows he pace of he energy ransition mus be accelerated signif­\n\nicantly,” DIW Weekly Report, no. 27 (2022): 371–379 (available online; accessed on January 8, 2024. \n\nThis applies o all other online sources in his repor unless stated otherwise); up-to-date figures \n\nand diagrams are available on he Ampel-Monitor Energiewende website a any ime (in German; \n\navailable online).\n\n2 European Commission, “Fi for 55: Delivering on he proposals,” (2023) (available online).\n\n3 The following charts and further analyses, including hose relating o energy efficiency argets \n\nand other aspects, such as green hydrogen, are provided in he Open Energy Tracker (available \n\nonline).

This law was passed in he run-up o he UN \n\nClimate Change Conference (COP21) ha ook place in Paris in \n\nDecember 2015. This ac made i mandatory among other hings, \n\nfor he French governmen o develop a national decarbonization \n\nstrategy (Stratégie Nationale Bas Carbone,2 SNBC) for he firs \n\ntime as well as a multi-annual energy program (Programmation \n\nPluriannuelle de l’Énergie,3 PPE). Both programs contain quanti­\n\ntative argets for a series of subsectors. They are intended o help \n\nFrance reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, become more ener­\n\ngy efficient, and increase its share of renewable energy.\n\nThe decarbonization strategy (SNBC) sets ou a long-term goal for \n\ngreenhouse gas emissions and short-term emissions budgets for \n\nthree successive five-year periods. These budgets se upper limits \n\nfor otal greenhouse gas emissions ha may no be exceeded in \n\nthe respective period. The strategy mus be revised every five \n\nyears, whereby one par of he upper limi se in he previous strat­\n\negy mus be amended and a new upper limi proposed for he nex \n\nfive-year period. The firs SNBC se an emissions limi for he peri­\n\nods from 2015 o 2018,4 from 2019 o 2023, and from 2024 o 2028. \n\nThe second SNBC revised he upper limi se for he period from \n\n2019 o 2023 and from 2024 o 2028, and introduced a new upper \n\nlimi for he period from 2029 o 2033. The hird SNBC should cur­\n\nrently being drafted by he government.\n\nThe multi-annual energy program (PPE) is based on a similar \n\nprinciple. I sets ou plans for wo five-year periods and is reviewed \n\n1 \n\nLégifrance, Loi no 2015-992 du 17 aoû 2015 relative à la ransition énergétique pour la \n\n croissance verte, 2022 (available online).\n\n2 Ministère de la Transition écologique e solidaire, Stratégie Nationale Bas Carbone (2020) \n\n(available online).\n\n3 Ministère de la Transition écologique e solidaire, Programmation Pluriannuelle de l’Energie \n\n(2020) (available online).\n\n4 The firs SNBC was revised from 2018 o 2019 due o he adoption of he Energy and Climate \n\nAc and he new climate neutrality arget. As a result, he firs budge only covers four years \n\n instead of five.\n\nevery five years. I sets argets specifically for he energy sector, \n\nwith a lower and an upper arge value being defined in each case.\n\nSome provisions of he ac from 2015 were amended by he \n\nEnergy and Climate Act5 of November 8, 2019.6 Since hen, i \n\nhas represented another cornerstone of France’s energy and \n\nenvironmental policy. In particular, i led o he governmen being \n\nmandated o pass a law every five years (Loi de programmation \n\n quinquennale sur l'économie e le climat), which sets ou in detail \n\nthe argets and priorities of its energy and climate policy for he \n\nnex five years. The firs five-year law should have been adopted \n\nby July 1, 2023,7 bu he governmen did no mee his deadline. \n\nThe new French energy and climate strategy (SFEC)8 was pub­\n\nlished only on November 22, 2023. This strategy contains, among \n\nother hings, quantitative argets ha are likely o be included \n\nin he nex multi-annual energy program (PPE3). A he end of \n\nDecember, he firs draf version of he energy sovereignty ac was \n\npublished, which is intended o serve as he energy block of he \n\npreviously mentioned firs five-year law.9\n\nAfter Presiden Emmanuel Macron was re-elected in May 2022, \n\ntwo differen ministries were responsible for energy and envi­\n\nronmental issues: The Ministry for he Energy Transition and \n\nthe Ministry of Ecological Transition and Territorial Cohesion. In \n\naddition, a General Secretaria for Ecological Planning was se up, \n\nwhich reports directly o he Prime Minister. After he governmen \n\nreshuffle on January 9, 2024, he Ministry for he Energy Transition \n\nwas suppressed , and he energy portfolio was ransferred o he \n\nMinistry of Economy and Finance.\n\n5 Légifrance, Loi no 2019-1147 du 8 novembre 2019 relative à l’énergie e au clima (2019) \n\n( available online).\n\n6 The objectives and provisions provided for in he various energy-related laws are summarised \n\nin he French Energy Code.

Between \n\n2020 and 2022, gross emissions in France remained below \n\nthe emissions budget. However, hese findings should be \n\ninterpreted with caution since both he COVID-19 pandemic \n\nand he energy price crisis occurred in his period, which led \n\nto a significan reduction in energy consumption and here­\n\nfore emissions. Furthermore, ne greenhouse gas emissions \n\nin 2019 and 2021 were above he indicative yearly limits set. \n\nThis is due o, among other hings, he fac ha he reduc­\n\ntion in greenhouse gases from forestry was less han planned. \n\nOverall, ne emissions in France were herefore slightly above \n\nthe arge in he period from 2015 o 2021 (more recen data \n\nis no ye available).9\n\n8 Ministère de la Transition Énergétique, Ajustemen echnique des budgets carbone (2022) \n\n(available online).\n\n9 Hau Conseil pour le Clima (HCC), Rappor annuel (2023): 65 (available online).\n\nThe decarbonization strategy (SNBC) also contains an esti­\n\nmate of emissions budgets by sector, which are consisten \n\nwith he overall five-year budget. However, his breakdown \n\nis only indicative. One sector can emi more if his is off­\n\nse by a greater reduction in emissions in another sector, as \n\nlong as he overall budge is respected. In contrast, Germany \n\nhas so far had argets for each sector. However, he curren \n\ndraf amendmen o he Climate Protection Ac will allow \n\nonly one overall arge o apply in future, similar o France.10\n\nWith around 129 million ons of CO2 equivalen per year \n\nfor he period from 2019 o 2023, he ranspor sector has \n\nthe larges emissions budget.

The energy sec­\n\ntor is he sector with he second-lowes emissions budge \n\nafter waste.11 The buildings and ranspor sectors will have \n\nto reduce heir emissions he most: by around 45 and 30 per­\n\ncen respectively when comparing 2019 levels o he 2029–\n\n2033 period.\n\nSectoral emissions and sectoral argets in France differ \n\ngreatly from hose in Germany. In Germany, energy has \n\ntraditionally accounted for he highes share of otal emis­\n\nsions, which is primarily due o he high level of coal-fired \n\npower generation. I is followed by industry, as Germany has \n\na particularly large amoun of energy-intensive industry, and \n\nthen by he ranspor and buildings sectors.\n\nThe implementation of new European argets for reduc­\n\ning ne greenhouse gas emissions of a leas 55 percen by \n\n2030 will lead o a downward correction of France’s emis­\n\nsions budgets for he years 2024 o 2028 and for 2029 o \n\n2034. The Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for \n\nFrance,12 which was submi ed o he European Commission \n\nfor review in October 2023, sets ou an average emissions \n\nbudge for he period from 2024 o 2028 (2029 o 2034), which \n\nis six percen (14 percent) lower han in he curren decar­\n\nbonization strategy.\n\nRenewable energy share oo low\n\nThe European Renewable Energy Directive from 2009 con­\n\ntained binding argets for he share of renewable energy in \n\ngross final energy consumption for all Member States for \n\nthe year 2020. The arge for France was 23 percent, while for \n\nGermany i was 18 percent. However, France only achieved \n\n19.2 percen and, as a result, was he only country in he EU \n\nto miss its arge for 2020 (Figure 2).13\n\nThe mos importan renewable energy sources in France are \n\nrenewable solid biomass and residential waste used for hea \n\ngeneration (32 percen of renewable gross final energy con­\n\nsumption in 2022), followed by hydroelectric power (18 per­\n\ncent). Hea pumps, wind power, and biofuels each accoun \n\nfor around en o 14 percen of gross final energy consump­\n\ntion from renewable energy sources.14 In Germany, biomass \n\nfor hea generation has a similar share of energy supply from \n\nrenewable energy sources as i does in France; in contrast, he \n\n11 Ministère de la Transition Énergétique, Ajustemen echnique des budgets carbone (2022) \n\n(available online).\n\n12 European Commission, France – Draf Updated NECP 2021–2030 (2023) (available online).\n\n13 Ministère de la Transition Écologique e de la Cohésion des Territoires, Service des données \n\ne études statistiques, “Les énergies renouvelables en France en 2022 – Suivi de la directive (UE) \n\n2018/2001 relative à la promotion de l’utilisation des énergies renouvelables,” (2023) (available \n\nonline); and European Commission, “Assessmen of he draf updated National Energy and Climate \n\nPlan of France,” 3 (2023) (available online).\n\n14 Ministère de la Transition Écologique e de la Cohésion des Territoires, Service des données \n\ne études statistiques, “Les énergies renouvelables en France en 2022 – Suivi de la directive (UE) \n\n2018/2001 relative à la promotion de l’utilisation des énergies renouvelables,” (2023) (available \n\n online).\n\nshare of wind and solar energy in Germany is much higher \n\nand he share of hydroelectric power is significantly lower.15\n\nTo implemen curren EU requirements, he French Energy \n\nand Climate Ac of 2019 sets a arge of a leas 33 percen \n\nof renewable energy in gross final energy consumption by \n\n2030.16 In 2022, his share was 20.7 percent;17 in Germany \n\ni was 20.8 percent. After he EU arge was increased from 32 \n\nto 42.5 or even 45 percent,18 France is also expected o adjus \n\nits argets for 2030 accordingly. However, its recently submit­\n\nted plan contains no adjustmen of its argets so far.

This share has risen stead­\n\nily since 2015, from jus under 19 percen in 2015 o 28 per­\n\ncen in 2022.26 However, he rend for he years from 2020 \n\nto 2022 should be interpreted with caution, as 2022 was in \n\nmany respects an exceptional year for he French electricity \n\nsystem because generation from nuclear and hydroelectric \n\npower plants was historically low. In Germany, he argets \n\nfor renewable energy are significantly higher. The aim is o \n\nachieve a share of a leas 80 percen of renewable energy in \n\ngross electricity consumption by 2030.\n\nGrowth in photovoltaics\n\nFor he photovoltaics sector, France’s multi-annual energy \n\nprogram (PPE) sets a arge of 20.1 gigawa s (GW) of installed \n\ncapacity for 2023 and between 35.1 and 44 GW for 2028. By \n\nthe end of September 2023, here were 18.3 GW of installed \n\ncapacity, and no new data has been available since. This \n\nmeans ha 1.8 GW would have o have been added between \n\nSeptember and December 2023 for his arge o have been \n\nachieved, which is he equivalen of more han wha has \n\nbeen installed in he firs hree quarters of 2023. I can be \n\nassumed ha his arge will no be achieved. Nevertheless, \n\nexpansion of he photovoltaics industry since he beginning \n\nof 2021 has accelerated significantly and he rend over he \n\npas 12 months is significantly above ha of he pas five years \n\n(Figure 4). The firs draf of he hird multi-annual energy \n\nprogram contains even higher argets of 54 o 60 GW in 2030 \n\nand 75 o 100 GW in 2035.\n\nIn comparison, Germany has an installed capacity of over \n\n80 GW from photovoltaics. I plans o increase his figure \n\nto 215 GW by 2030 and o 309 GW by 2035. Relative o cur­\n\nren population, he argets for 2035 in France correspond o \n\naround 1.1 o 1.5 kilowa (kW) per capita. A around 3.7 kW \n\nper person, Germany’s arge for 2035 is around hree imes \n\nhigher.\n\nSlow expansion of onshore wind power\n\nFor onshore wind power plants, he curren plans sets capac­\n\nity argets of 24.1 GW for 2023 and 33.2 o 34.7 GW by 2028. \n\nA he end of September 2023, installed capacity amounted \n\nto 21.9 GW and was herefore 2.2 GW below he arge ha \n\nshould have been achieved hree months later. As a result, \n\nthe arge is likely o be missed.

Wind power and solar energy recently grew \n\nto en and four percen of power generation, respectively. \n\nThe otal share of renewable energy in overall power gener­\n\nation was 18 percent. Coal- and gas-fired power plants con­\n\ntinued on a downward rend and accounted for jus under \n\nseven percen of power generation in 2023 (compared o \n\nten percen in 2007).21 In 2023, only jus over one percen of \n\nelectricity generation in Germany came from nuclear power \n\nplants, while over half came from renewable energy sources. \n\nCoal- and gas-fired power plants ogether accounted for jus \n\nunder 42 percent.22\n\nAnnual power generation in France (527 o 550 erawa \n\nhours (TWh) in he period from 2000 o 2021) is usually well \n\nabove annual consumption (425 o 499 TWh),23 which makes \n\ni a ne exporter of electricity.24 The only exception was in 2022 \n\nwhen France became a ne importer due o a emporary out­\n\nage of a large portion of its nuclear power plants.

This figure \n\nshould rise o 115 GW by 2030 and o 157 GW by 2035. The \n\nFrench arge for 2035 corresponds o around 0.6 o 0.7 kW \n\nper capita; Germany’s arge is around 1.9 kW per capita.\n\nFrance’s foray into offshore wind power\n\nThe expansion of offshore wind power in France began in \n\nthe second quarter of 2022 with he commissioning of its \n\nfirs offshore wind farm off he coas of Saint-Nazaire with \n\na capacity of 480 MW. Two further farms were connected o \n\nthe grid by he end of 2023, increasing installed capacity o \n\naround 1.5 GW. However, his developmen will no be suffi­\n\ncien o achieve he arge of 2.4 GW of installed capacity se \n\nfor 2023. Hence, France firs needs o make up a shortfall of \n\naround one GW; i mus hen install a further 2.8 GW within \n\nfive years in order o achieve he lower arge of 5.2 GW by \n\n2028. To reach he upper arge of 6.2 GW, around hree \n\ntimes as much capacity as wha has been installed o date \n\nwould need o be added by he end of 2028. The new arge \n\nrecently proposed for 2030 of four GW is actually slightly \n\nbelow he lower arge of he curren multi-annual program \n\nplan; however, i is aiming o achieve much stronger growth \n\nup o 18 GW by 2035.\n\nIn comparison, Germany currently has an installed capacity \n\nof a good eight GW from offshore wind power. The plan is \n\nto reach 30 GW by 2030 and 40 GW jus five years after hat. \n\nIn erms of argets per capita, France’s new goal for 2035 is \n\nequivalen o 0.3 kW per capita, while in Germany his fig­\n\nure is nearly 0.5 kW.\n\nChanging course on nuclear power\n\nThe 2015 legislation se a arge for reducing he nuclear \n\npower share in otal electricity generation for he firs ime.

However, he buildings sector only \n\naccounted for around 18 percen of greenhouse gas emis­\n\nsions in 2021 due o a high proportion of electric heating.46 \n\nIn 2021, more han a hird of main residential buildings ha \n\nyear used electricity as heir main source of energy for heat­\n\ning (including jus under eigh percen with hea pumps).47 \n\nIn Germany, space heating accounts for a slightly smaller \n\nshare of final energy consumption han in France, a jus \n\nunder one hird.48 However, in 2022, hea pumps and stor­\n\nage heaters accounted for a significantly lower share of all \n\ndomestic heating systems in Germany a jus under six and \n\ntwo percen respectively.49\n\nFrance’s strategy for reducing emissions in he buildings \n\nsector is based on further electrifying its heating systems \n\nand banning echnologies with high emissions. In addition, \n\nenergy consumption is o be reduced hrough improved \n\nbuilding insulation. Since January 2023, new rental contracts \n\nfor apartments in existing buildings can only be concluded \n\nif hey mee a certain energy efficiency level.50 Furthermore, \n\nthe installation of heating systems ha emi more han 300 \n\ngrams of CO2 equivalen per kilowa hour has been prohib­\n\nited since July 1, 2022, which means a de facto ban on he \n\ninstallation of new oil-fired boilers.51 Besides, he installation \n\nof natural gas heating systems in new single-family homes \n\nhas been prohibited since 2022.

This star date \n\nwas o be brough forward by one year, bu after lengthy dis­\n\ncussions relating o he Buildings Energy Act, i is now being \n\npostponed. Gas or oil heating systems may now continue o \n\nbe installed in existing buildings until a heating plan is avail­\n\nable in he respective municipality, which may ake until June \n\n2028 depending on he municipality.53\n\nStrong growth of renewable energy in he heating \n\nsector\n\nBy 2030, France aims o achieve a 38 percen share of renew­\n\nable energy in gross final energy consumption for heating \n\nand cooling. In 2022, ha share was 27.2 percent. The larg­\n\nes contribution was made by heating with wood in house­\n\nholds (40 percen of energy consumption for heating and \n\ncooling from renewable energy sources), followed by hea \n\npumps (27 percent), and biomass excluding wood (23 per­\n\ncent).54 The share achieved was herefore slightly below he \n\nfigure expected from a linear arge path between 2015 and \n\n2030.55 However, he recen rend has been dynamic with \n\nthe share of renewable energy rising from 21.4 percen in \n\n2018 o 27.2 percen in 2022. If France can keep his pace \n\nup until 2030, i will achieve its arge of 38 percen for ha \n\nyear. The increase was largely due o he expansion of hea \n\npump installation, which progressed much faster in France \n\nthan in Germany. One reason for he lower uptake of hea \n\npumps in Germany is likely its higher household electric­\n\nity prices. Furthermore, natural gas was long regarded as a \n\n“bridge fuel” in Germany, and he installation of new nat­\n\nural gas heating systems was even subsidized here until \n\nrecently. In France, hea pumps have been subsidized for \n\nsome ime now.\n\nThe multi-annual energy program sets ou specific goals \n\nfor annual hea generation from hea pumps. The arge for \n\n2023 is jus under 40 TWh per year, of which 35 TWh is o be \n\nprovided by air-source hea pumps and jus under five TWh \n\nby geothermal hea pumps.56 In 2022, otal hea generation \n\nfrom hea pumps amounted o 42.7 TWh (weather-adjusted \n\nto 47.6 TWh), which is well above he arget.

In general, France is behind \n\non all its argets o expand photovoltaics and onshore and \n\noffshore wind power. I is instead relying on nuclear power. \n\nThis is a political decision, which clearly underlines he “éco­\n\nlogie à la française” under Macron’s presidency.59,60 However, \n\nif its argets for renewable energy are o be achieved, i will \n\nneed o expand its wind and solar power plants significantly.\n\nAlthough here are differences in he energy policy goals of \n\nFrance and Germany, here are also similarities. Greenhouse \n\ngas emissions are already significantly lower in France, bu \n\nGermany is aiming o go climate neutral five years before \n\nFrance. In erms of mobility and space heating, both coun­\n\ntries are focusing on electrification. While Germany’s argets \n\nfor electromobility are more ambitious, he number of elec­\n\ntric cars and charging infrastructure clearly needs o grow \n\nfaster in both countries. France is currently making faster \n\nprogress han Germany on expanding hea pumps.\n\nThe differences are greates in he electricity sector: While \n\nFrance is prioritizing nuclear power,61 Germany is relying \n\nheavily on renewable energy. France is also aiming o use \n\nmore wind power and solar energy over he long erm, bu \n\na a considerably lower level.\n\nI would make sense for France o expand renewable energy \n\nfaster. This would no only allow i o achieve its argets for \n\nrenewable energy, which i has no met, bu i would also help \n\nthe country mee its climate goals and safeguard agains he \n\nrisks of using nuclear power. If here are further problems \n\nwith existing power plants in he future or delays in con­\n\nstructing new reactors, an additional, increased expansion \n\nof renewable energy would be helpful. The risk ha France \n\nwould generate “too much” emission-free power as a result, \n\nappears o be low considering he strong growth in demand \n\nfor renewable electricity expected in Europe.\n\n59 Which can be ranslated in English as a kind of “made in France ecology.”\n\n60 Cf.

In 2022, only 236,000 hea pumps were \n\ninstalled;57 half a million new hea pumps are expected o be \n\ninstalled each year from 2024.\n\nConclusion: Positive and negative developments \n\nin he French energy ransition\n\nFrance’s energy and climate policy comprises a large num­\n\nber of short-, medium-, and long-term argets ha are revised \n\nin five-year, structured planning processes.
