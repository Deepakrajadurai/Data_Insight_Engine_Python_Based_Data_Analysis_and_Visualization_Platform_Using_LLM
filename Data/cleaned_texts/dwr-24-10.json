Better financ­\n\ning conditions and the slowdown in price momentum are likely \n\nto somewhat boost both private consumption as well as corpo­\n\nrate investments over the course of 2024. Nevertheless, there \n\nis currently still a great deal of uncertainty, particular in regard \n\nto the future economic policy environment, which is causing \n\nhouseholds and companies to remain cautious in Germany. \n\nIn addition, fiscal policy stimuli as well as foreign demand are \n\nlacking. German GDP will virtually stagnate and, carried by \n\nprivate consumption and public investments in equipment, \n\nincrease more markedly by 1.2 percent in 2025. The global \n\neconomy will continue to develop more robustly than Ger­\n\nmany; it is projected to increase by 3.5 percent in both 2024 \n\nand 2025, which should gradually strengthen German exports.\n\nGlobal economy: Industry fighting its way out of a \n\nslump, geopolitical risks are high\n\nThe global economy expanded by 3.9  percent in 2023 \n\n(Figure 1). Growth is subdued compared to historical stand­\n\nards, but nevertheless robust given the prevailing challenges. \n\nIn many places, high energy prices, higher interest rates, a \n\nloss of purchasing power due to inflation, and geopolitical \n\ncrises and uncertainties weighed on economic development. \n\nIn most countries, this weakened the industrial sector in par­\n\nticular, while services fared somewhat better.\n\nThe advanced economies, especially the United States, did \n\nprovide a boost to the global economy. The US economy \n\nexperienced a surprisingly strong expansion of 2.5 percent \n\n(Table 1). Comprehensive fiscal policy stimuli from 2020 to \n\n2022 continued to support private consumption and corpo­\n\nrate investments. Of the emerging economies, China con­\n\ntributed significantly to global growth: The Chinese econ­\n\nomy grew by 5.2 percent in 2023. Compared to the pre-pan­\n\ndemic years, however, this growth was considerably weaker. \n\nIn 2023, the recovery following the zero COVID policy was \n\novershadowed by lasting problems in the real estate sector \n\nin particular. The Mexican economy grew by 3.2 percent in \n\n2023, although exports to the United States have not been \n\nas dynamic of late. The Brazilian economy grew by 3.1 per­\n\ncent, in part thanks to strong harvests and exports in the first \n\nhalf of 2023. The Indian economy expanded by a powerful \n\n6.9 percent in 2023 due to solid domestic demand.\n\nThe European economy, in contrast, stagnated overall, stalled \n\nby the energy price crisis and restrictive monetary policy. \n\nWith growth of only 0.5 percent, the euro area contributed lit­\n\ntle to global economic growth in 2023. The United Kingdom \n\nfell into a technical recession in the second half of 2023, \n\nmeaning it experienced two back-to-back quarters of declin­\n\ning economic output (by 0.1 and 0.3 percent). The aftermath \n\nof the cost of living crisis weighed heavily on growth in the \n\nUK throughout 2023.1 The Japanese economy expanded by \n\n1 \n\nCf. Arnab Bhattacharjee and Adrian Pabst, Improving UK Living Standards (National Institute \n\nof Economic and Social Research: 2024) (Accessed on February 28, 2024. This applies to all other \n\nonline sources in this report unless stated otherwise).\n\n87\n\nDIW Weekly Report 10+11/2024\n\nDIW BERLIN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK\n\n1.9 percent in 2023, but fell into a technical recession in the \n\nsecond half of the year. High inflation there is also weigh­\n\ning on domestic demand in particular. Only the trade bal­\n\nance was positive because exports grew more strongly than \n\nimports due to the weak yen.\n\nThe global economy is likely to grow relatively robustly in \n\nthe first quarter of 2024. The Purchasing Managers' Indices \n\nfor manufacturing have recorded an upward trend in most \n\nadvanced economies recently, despite the fact that the \n\nmajor euro area Member States and the UK are still below \n\nthe expansion threshold. In the emerging economies, the \n\nPurchasing Managers' Index for China (Caixin) has been \n\nabove the expansion threshold since November 2023 and \n\nin Brazil since December 2023. Industry, which has been \n\nweak globally, should thus gradually overcome this slump. \n\nHowever, manufacturing continues to be weak, especially in \n\nJapan and Germany. While this is due to the high costs for \n\nimports given the weak yen and subdued domestic demand \n\nin Japan, high energy prices and weak foreign demand are \n\nweighing on the development in Germany.\n\nIn the United States, growth is likely to slow somewhat to \n\n0.5 percent (annualized 1.9 percent) in the first quarter of \n\n2024. The South Korean economy is expanding at a simi­\n\nlar rate, driven by strong semiconductor exports. The euro \n\narea as well as the UK are likely to gradually recover, with \n\nquarterly growth of 0.1 percent. Japan's economy is likely to \n\nonly grow by 0.4 percent due to persistently high inflation.\n\nIn most emerging economies, in contrast, strong growth \n\nis expected in the first quarter of 2024 (Table 1). In China, \n\nconsumers spent considerably more money around the \n\nLunar New Year holiday as compared to before the pan­\n\ndemic; tourist traffic and tourism expanded as well. The \n\nChinese economy is likely to expand by 1.0 percent in the \n\nfirst quarter of 2024. Economic output in the Central and \n\nEastern European countries of the European Union will \n\nlikely expand by 0.7 percent in the first quarter of 2024 due \n\nto falling inflation rates and stronger consumption, a slightly \n\ngreater increase than recently.\n\nInternational trade will probably experience only moderate \n\ngrowth in 2024. Although the supply bottlenecks of recent \n\nyears have eased, more expensive transportation costs can­\n\nnot be ruled out due to the conflicts in the Red Sea and the \n\ndrought in the Panama Canal. International trade declined \n\nby 1.9 percent in 2023.\n\nMonetary policy in many advanced economies, except for \n\nJapan, will remain restrictive at the beginning of 2024. \n\nHowever, as inflations rates are falling in the euro area, \n\nthe European Central Bank is expected to make its first key \n\ninterest rate cut in early summer. Lending to households \n\nhas also stabilized recently.2 In the United States, inflation \n\ndid not decline further in January 2024, primarily due to \n\n2 Cf. Deutsche Bundesbank, \"Geldpolitik und Geldmarktentwicklung,\" Monatsbericht Februar (2024) \n\n(in German; available online).\n\nhigher living costs. Thus, an initial interest rate decrease in \n\nMarch, as widely expected by financial markets, is no longer \n\nlikely. In many emerging economies, monetary policy has \n\nalready been loosened: The Chinese central bank lowered \n\nthe five-year key interest rate for mortgages, a further sup­\n\nportive measure for the country’s struggling real estate sec­\n\ntor. Weak domestic demand is also reflected by a deflation­\n\nary trend in China, where prices fell by a further 0.8 per­\n\ncent in January 2024.\n\nFiscal policy will likely only provide moderate stimuli for the \n\neconomy during the forecast period. In light of higher inter­\n\nest rates, many governments are holding back on additional \n\nspending, partly to comply with fiscal deficit and debt rules. \n\nHowever, the federal deficit remains high in the United States \n\nand will be considerably above five percent of economic out­\n\nput in 2024 and 2025. In the United Kingdom, further fiscal \n\nmeasures that appeal to voters are to be expected given the \n\nforthcoming British general election, most likely in the form \n\nof further tax relief for companies. Medium-term investment \n\npackages are likely to continue to support economic growth \n\nin the advanced economies.\n\nOverall, the global economy is expected to grow by 3.5 per­\n\ncent in 2024; growth in the advanced economies is likely to \n\nbe 1.5 percent. The upcoming turnaround in interest rates \n\nwill probably have a positive impact on investment activity \n\nin many countries. In the euro area, continued increases in \n\nreal wages will provide stronger momentum to private con­\n\nsumption. In the United States, household savings from the \n\nFigure 1\n\nGrowth of real GDP\n\nQuarter-on-quarter percentage growth (left axis); \n\nindex 2015 Q1 = 100 (right axis)\n\n \n\nSources: National Statistical Offices; DIW Berlin Economic Outlook Winter 2023.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nThe expected turnaround in interest rates should have a positive impact on global \n\neconomic development from the second half of 2024.\n\n88\n\nDIW Weekly Report 10+11/2024\n\nDIW BERLIN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK\n\nCOVID relief measures are expected to continue dwindling \n\nand be depleted by mid-year. However, rising real wages are \n\nlikely to support consumption even after the fiscal stimulus \n\nexpires in the second half of 2024. In the emerging econo­\n\nmies, economic output will likely increase by 4.7 percent in \n\n2024. China's persistent problems in the real estate sector, \n\nweak domestic demand, and deflationary trends, as well as \n\nongoing trade tensions with the United States, are likely to \n\nlimit growth to below five percent. Russia is continuing to \n\nconvert its economy to a war economy, as arms-related sec­\n\ntors are expanding strongly. Overall, Russia's economic out­\n\nput is likely to increase as a result.3\n\n3 Cf. The Bank of Finland Institute for Emerging Economies, \"Russia’s GDP growth last year \n\n higher than expected; lower growth ahead,\" BOFIT Weekly Review no. 7 (2024) (available online).\n\nIn 2025, the global economy is projected to expand by a fur­\n\nther 3.5 percent when the economic growth in the advanced \n\neconomies returns to its long-term trend in light of nor­\n\nmalized inflation rates and falling interest rates. Then, \n\nthe emerging economies will finally benefit from stronger \n\nglobal demand.\n\nTable 1\n\nReal GDP, consumer prices, and unemployment rates in the global economy\n\nIn percent\n\nGDP\n\nConsumer prices\n\nUnemployment rate in percent\n\nYear-on-year percentage change\n\n2022 \n\n2023 \n\n2024 \n\n2025 \n\n2022 \n\n2023 \n\n2024 \n\n2025 \n\n2022 \n\n2023 \n\n2024 \n\n2025 \n\nEurope\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nEuropean Union\n\n3.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.9\n\n1.9\n\n9.2 \n\n6.4 \n\n3.0\n\n2.4\n\n6.1\n\n6.0\n\n6.2\n\n6.0\n\nEuro area \n\n3.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n1.5\n\n8.4 \n\n5.4 \n\n2.6\n\n2.0\n\n6.7\n\n6.5\n\n6.5\n\n6.4\n\nexcluding Germany \n\n3.9\n\n1.1\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n8.0 \n\n5.0 \n\n2.6\n\n2.1\n\n8.5\n\n8.2\n\n8.2\n\n8.1\n\nFrance\n\n2.5\n\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\n1.4\n\n5.9 \n\n5.7 \n\n2.5\n\n1.9\n\n7.3\n\n7.3\n\n7.4\n\n7.3\n\nItaly\n\n3.9\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n1.0\n\n8.7 \n\n5.9 \n\n2.3\n\n2.2\n\n8.1\n\n7.6\n\n7.7\n\n7.7\n\nSpain\n\n5.8\n\n2.5\n\n1.8\n\n2.1\n\n8.3 \n\n3.4 \n\n3.2\n\n2.1\n\n12.9\n\n12.1\n\n11.5\n\n11.1\n\nNetherlands\n\n4.4\n\n0.1\n\n0.9\n\n1.9\n\n11.6 \n\n4.1 \n\n2.7\n\n2.1\n\n3.5\n\n3.6\n\n3.9\n\n3.8\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n4.3\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n1.5\n\n9.1 \n\n7.3 \n\n2.5\n\n2.0\n\n3.9\n\n4.0\n\n4.3\n\n4.7\n\nSwitzerland\n\n2.7\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.9\n\n2.8 \n\n2.1 \n\n1.6\n\n1.5\n\n4.3\n\n4.1\n\n4.4\n\n4.3\n\nCentral and Eastern Europe\n\n4.7\n\n0.3\n\n2.4\n\n3.3\n\n13.4 \n\n11.6 \n\n4.3\n\n3.6\n\n3.5\n\n3.6\n\n3.4\n\n3.1\n\nTurkey\n\n5.3\n\n4.0\n\n2.7\n\n3.2\n\n72.3 \n\n54.0 \n\n50.9\n\n36.0\n\n10.5\n\n9.5\n\n9.5\n\n10.0\n\nRussia1\n\n−1.3\n\n3.0\n\n3.4\n\n1.4\n\n13.8 \n\n5.9 \n\n6.5\n\n5.0\n\n3.9\n\n3.2\n\n2.8\n\n2.7\n\nThe Americas\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nUSA\n\n1.9\n\n2.5\n\n2.2\n\n1.5\n\n8.0 \n\n4.1 \n\n2.6\n\n1.9\n\n3.6\n\n3.6\n\n3.9\n\n4.0\n\nMexico\n\n3.9\n\n3.2\n\n1.8\n\n2.2\n\n7.9 \n\n5.5 \n\n3.7\n\n3.1\n\n3.3\n\n2.9\n\n3.2\n\n3.3\n\nBrazil\n\n3.1\n\n3.1\n\n1.6\n\n2.1\n\n9.3 \n\n4.6 \n\n3.4\n\n2.9\n\n9.5\n\n8.3\n\n10.6\n\n14.8\n\nAsia\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nJapan\n\n0.9\n\n1.9\n\n1.0\n\n1.1\n\n2.5 \n\n3.3 \n\n2.5\n\n1.3\n\n2.6\n\n2.6\n\n2.4\n\n2.4\n\nSouth Korea\n\n2.6\n\n1.3\n\n2.2\n\n2.3\n\n5.1 \n\n3.6 \n\n2.4\n\n1.9\n\n2.9\n\n2.7\n\n3.1\n\n3.1\n\nChina\n\n3.0\n\n5.2\n\n4.7\n\n4.5\n\n2.0 \n\n0.2 \n\n1.0\n\n1.8\n\n5.6\n\n5.2\n\n5.0\n\n5.0\n\nIndia\n\n6.6\n\n6.9\n\n6.3\n\n6.3\n\n6.7 \n\n5.8 \n\n5.1\n\n3.9\n\n7.6\n\n7.6\n\n7.2\n\n7.4\n\nTotal\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAdvanced economies\n\n2.5\n\n1.7\n\n1.5\n\n1.5\n\n7.7 \n\n4.6 \n\n2.6\n\n2.0\n\n4.4\n\n4.3\n\n4.5\n\n4.5\n\nEmerging economies\n\n3.8\n\n5.3\n\n4.7\n\n4.6\n\n8.4 \n\n6.8 \n\n7.9\n\n7.5\n\n6.3\n\n6.0\n\n5.9\n\n6.3\n\nGlobal economy\n\n3.3\n\n3.9\n\n3.5\n\n3.5\n\n7.9 \n\n5.5 \n\n5.1\n\n4.7\n\n5.9\n\n5.6\n\n5.6\n\n5.9\n\nFor reference:\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nExport weighted2\n\n2.9\n\n2.9\n\n2.6\n\n2.6\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nGDP weighted in USD3\n\n3.2\n\n3.0\n\n3.0\n\n3.0\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1 The data forecast for Russia are subject to major uncertainties.

After \n\neconomic output stagnated for three quarters in 2023, it fell \n\nin the final quarter, down by 0.3 percent quarter on quarter, \n\nand in the year as a whole by 0.3 percent as well. While for­\n\neign demand declined due to weak global industrial produc­\n\ntion, repeated interest rate hikes by the European Central \n\nBank (ECB) and high inflation rates  dampened domestic \n\ndemand. Although consumer prices have had almost con­\n\nsistently lower growth rates since the beginning of 2023, in \n\nparticular due to falling energy prices, the annual average \n\ninflation rate was still 5.9 percent.\n\nNevertheless, high wage agreements over the course of 2023 \n\nled to a slight increase in real wages. However, this increase \n\ncould not compensate for consumers’ previous loss of pur­\n\nchasing power. The development of incomes and prices led \n\nto lasting uncertainty, which dampened consumer senti­\n\nment and caused private consumption to fall markedly in \n\n2023 as a whole. Rising nominal interest rates are also pro­\n\nviding incentives to save, which has further increased the \n\nalready high savings rate.\n\nFinancing costs also rose due to the interest rate hikes and \n\ndampened investment activity of private households and \n\nenterprises. Construction investments in particular declined \n\nconsiderably, especially due to weakening private residen­\n\ntial construction. At the same time, investments in equip­\n\nment likely benefited from the high order backlog, a result \n\nof the recovery following the coronavirus pandemic, and \n\nincreased overall. In contrast, weak foreign demand weighed \n\non exports. However, as imports declined even more sharply \n\ndue to high energy prices and low demand for foreign inter­\n\nmediary goods from domestic industry, the trade balance \n\nwas positive.\n\nDespite the weak economic situation, employment reached \n\nan all-time high with an annual average of 45.9 million  people \n\nin employment. Primarily migration made this employment \n\ngrowth possible. The additional jobs in healthcare, educa­\n\ntion, and public administration created by the federal, state, \n\nand local governments also played a role. Simultaneously, \n\nthe number of registered unemployed increased and the \n\nunemployment rate grew from 5.3 percent in 2022 to 5.7 per­\n\ncent in 2023.\n\nThe gross value added, especially in manufacturing, was in \n\ndecline over the second half of 2023. Energy-intensive sec­\n\ntors in particular suffered due to the permanently height­\n\nened energy prices.\n\nWeak start to 2024\n\nThe same factors are still expected to weigh on the German \n\neconomy in the first quarter of 2024, resulting in a 0.1-percent \n\ndecline in economic output (Figure 2). Thus, the German \n\neconomy will likely contract for the third quarter in a row \n\n(Table 2).4\n\nNominal wages and disposable income continue their \n\nstrong upward trend and inflation rates are declining more \n\nand more, which results in higher purchasing power. \n\nNevertheless, consumer sentiment among private house­\n\nholds remains subdued and is characterized by uncertainty \n\nabout economic developments.5 This can be seen in, for \n\nexample, the GfK-Konsumklimaindex, which is currently stag­\n\nnating in the  negatives. Retail sales also declined again in \n\nJanuary 2024. Thus, private consumption is likely to experi­\n\nence only minimal growth and will be unable to prevent a \n\ndecline in GDP in the first quarter of 2024 (Table 2).\n\nIn contrast, slight negative stimuli are expected from invest­\n\nments in the first quarter of 2024. While manufacturers of \n\ncapital goods still have a large stock of existing orders, new \n\norders are trending downward; only some bulk orders are \n\ninterrupting this trend. The ifo Business Climate Index for \n\nGermany is also not suggesting the situation will improve \n\nin the short term. Thus, investments in equipment are likely \n\nto fall in the first quarter of 2024. In the area of construction \n\n4 Economic performance already began declining in the third quarter of 2023, even if only \n\n marginally by 0.01 percent. Thus, the German economy has been in a technical recession since the \n\nfourth quarter of 2023.\n\n5 For example, the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index for Germany has increased noticeably \n\nsince May 2023 and has since remained markedly above the overall European index values.\n\nFigure 2\n\nReal GDP growth in Germany \n\nIn billions of euros (left axis) and quarter-on-quarter in percent \n\n(right axis)\n\n \n\nNote: Forecast from the first quarter of 2024; adjusted for price, seasonal, and calendar effects. \n\nSources: Federal Statistical Office; DIW Berlin Economic Outlook Spring 2024. \n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nAfter stagnating in 2024, the economy is projected to pick up again significantly \n\nin 2025. \n\n90\n\nDIW Weekly Report 10+11/2024\n\nDIW BERLIN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK\n\nFigure 3\n\nGDP and important components \n\nSeasonally, calendar, and price-adjusted development\n\n \n\nNote: Forecast from the first quarter of 2024; adjusted for price, seasonal, and calendar effects. \n\nSources: Federal Statistical Office; DIW Berlin Economic Outlook Spring 2024.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\n91\n\nDIW Weekly Report 10+11/2024\n\nDIW BERLIN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK\n\ninvestment, residential construction in particular is likely to \n\nremain weak in the first quarter of 2024 due to persistently \n\nhigh interest rates. In light of a historically low number of \n\nincoming orders and building permits as well as a stagnation \n\nin new credit volume, a continued marked decline is expected \n\nhere. Only non-residential construction (especially civil engi­\n\nneering) may have a supporting effect and somewhat cush­\n\nion the renewed decline in construction investment.\n\nAs of the beginning of 2024, foreign trade is also not pro­\n\nviding any growth stimuli; both imports as well as exports \n\nare likely to decline in the first quarter and not contribute to \n\neconomic output overall. While a majority of the Purchasing \n\nManagers’ Indices in other European countries are trending \n\nupward again, the values are often still in the negatives. A \n\nrecovery in foreign industrial production, which could ben­\n\nefit German exports, is therefore unlikely to materialize in \n\nthe first quarter, meaning that exports will probably continue \n\nto decline. Furthermore, leading indicators for the German \n\nmanufacturing industry, such as capacity utilization and the \n\nGerman Purchasing Managers’ Index, suggest that imports \n\nof intermediary goods may also decline again (Figure 3).\n\nConsumption picking up speed, supported \n\nby investments\n\nFrom the second quarter of 2024, factors weighing on domes­\n\ntic and foreign demand should begin to weaken. Following \n\nthe decline in inflation rates in 2023, which was primarily \n\ndue to falling energy prices, weakening price pressure on \n\nfood and non-energy goods will likely have a greater effect \n\non inflation in 2024. Overall, inflation in Germany and in \n\nthe euro area is expected to reach the ECB’s two-percent \n\ntarget within 2024. The European Central Bank is there­\n\nfore expected to herald a turnaround in interest rates at the \n\nend of the second quarter. Falling interest rates are likely \n\nto decrease financing costs for companies and households \n\nand make saving more unattractive. Simultaneously, indus­\n\ntry worldwide will slowly crawl out of its slump and stimu­\n\nlate foreign demand.\n\nPrivate consumption is likely to be the main driver of the \n\neconomic upswing for the remainder of the forecast period. \n\nThe continuing slowdown in price momentum, which will \n\nstrengthen consumer confidence, will probably make a key \n\ncontribution to this. Real wages are expected to continue to \n\nrise, gradually over the forecast horizon, compensating for the \n\nloss of purchasing power in the past years. After wages rose in \n\nmany cases due to one-off inflation adjustment premiums in \n\n2023, sustainable wage increases according to pay scales are \n\nlikely to increasingly come into effect in 2024. This is likely \n\nto positively influence households’ income security and boost \n\nconsumption. Falling nominal interest rates are also likely to \n\nlead to a decline in the savings rate and a significant increase \n\nin private households’ propensity to consume in 2025.\n\nDeclining financing costs are likely to have only a delayed \n\nimpact on residential construction, meaning that construction \n\nTable 2\n\nQuarterly data on the development of use and value-added components of real GDP in Germany \n\nIn percent (quarter-on-quarter, seasonally and calendar adjusted)\n\n2023\n\n2024\n\n2025\n\nI \n\nII\n\nIII\n\nIV\n\nI\n\nII\n\nIII\n\nIV\n\nI\n\nII\n\nIII\n\nIV\n\nPrivate consumption\n\n−0.6\n\n0.2\n\n−0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\nPublic consumption expenditure\n\n−1.4\n\n−0.2\n\n1.1\n\n0.3\n\n−0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\nGross facilities investment\n\n1.0\n\n−0.0\n\n0.1\n\n−1.9\n\n−0.5\n\n−0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.5\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\nConstruction\n\n1.5\n\n−0.5\n\n−0.8\n\n−1.7\n\n−0.8\n\n−0.4\n\n−0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\nEquipment\n\n1.9\n\n0.8\n\n1.4\n\n−3.5\n\n−0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.6\n\n1.0\n\n1.1\n\n1.3\n\n1.4\n\n1.4\n\nOther investment\n\n−1.6\n\n−0.0\n\n0.3\n\n0.7\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.7\n\n0.7\n\nInventory changes1\n\n−0.5\n\n0.5\n\n−0.6\n\n−0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\nDomestic consumption\n\n−0.9\n\n0.6\n\n−0.4\n\n−0.3\n\n−0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\nNet exports\n\n1.0\n\n−0.5\n\n0.3\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n−0.0\n\n−0.0\n\n−0.0\n\n−0.0\n\n−0.0\n\n−0.1\n\n−0.1\n\nExports\n\n−0.2\n\n−0.9\n\n−0.7\n\n−1.6\n\n−1.1\n\n−0.1\n\n0.3\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\nImports\n\n−2.2\n\n0.1\n\n−1.5\n\n−1.7\n\n−1.3\n\n−0.1\n\n0.4\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\nGDP\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n−0.0\n\n−0.3\n\n−0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\nGross value added\n\n0.3\n\n−0.0\n\n−0.0\n\n−0.4\n\n−0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\nManufacturing\n\n0.1\n\n0.3\n\n−0.9\n\n−1.4\n\n−0.6\n\n−0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\nConstruction\n\n5.0\n\n−0.4\n\n−0.1\n\n−2.6\n\n−0.6\n\n−0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\nTrade, hospitality, transport\n\n−0.7\n\n0.1\n\n0.9\n\n−0.9\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\nProfessional services provider\n\n−0.1\n\n0.6\n\n−0.0\n\n0.2\n\n−0.2\n\n−0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\nPublic services, education, health\n\n1.0\n\n−0.6\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n1 Contribution to growth in percentage points.\n\nNote: Forecast from the first quarter of 2024; adjusted for price, seasonal, and calendar effects. \n\nSources: Federal Statistical Office; DIW Berlin Economic Outlook Spring 2024.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\n92\n\nDIW Weekly Report 10+11/2024\n\nDIW BERLIN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK\n\ninvestment will probably continue to decline for the time \n\nbeing; it is not expected to stabilize until the end of 2024 \n\n(Figure 3). The slight decline anticipated in construction \n\nprices from the record highs in recent years should then also \n\nboost demand somewhat. Non-residential construction will \n\nprobably continue to benefit primarily from investments in \n\ncivil engineering, above all in rail and road construction, and \n\nprevent an even greater slump in construction investment. \n\nNon-residential construction is expected to support momen­\n\ntum in construction investment in 2025 as well.\n\nInvestments in equipment over the course of the forecast \n\nperiod are expected to be significantly determined by pub­\n\nlic defense spending and should be supporting economic \n\ngrowth in 2025 in particular. These investments are likely \n\nto massively increase in the second half of 2024 and in 2025 \n\nin particular as a part of the Bundeswehr’s special fund. \n\nMeanwhile, lower growth in acquisition expenditure is \n\nexpected from private investors. For example, according to \n\nDIHK surveys, corporate willingness to invest has recently \n\nfallen repeatedly. This is due to, among other things, uncer­\n\ntainties regarding long-term economic policy, for example \n\nin regards to climate and transition policy.\n\nAs the economies of key German trading partners continue \n\nto recover, German exports are likely to increase again from \n\nthe second half of 2024. Imports are also expected to increase, \n\nsupported by the recovery in the manufacturing industry and \n\nthe related strong foreign demand for intermediary goods. \n\nThis demand will also be significantly stronger in 2025 due \n\nto the expansion of public investments in military equip­\n\nment and will then result in a slightly negative trade balance.\n\nNo clear stimuli are expected from fiscal policy measures in \n\n2024. The reduced consumption taxes on natural gas and in \n\nthe food service industry expired at the beginning of 2024 \n\nand the CO2 surcharge was increased. Energy and electricity \n\nsubsidies for private households will end in April. The larg­\n\nest expansionary stimulus will probably come from a consid­\n\nerable increase in defense spending in both 2024 and 2025. \n\nOverall, revenue is likely to increase more strongly than \n\nexpenditure in 2024 and 2025. The public deficit will likely \n\ndecline from 1.2 in 2024 to 0.7 percent of GDP in 2025. The \n\ndebt-to-GDP ratio according to the Maastricht Criteria is \n\nlikely to fall from 63.6 to 62.6 percent of GDP.\n\nThe manufacturing industry is likely to recover somewhat \n\nover the course of 2024 thanks to momentum in investments \n\nand increase more considerably in 2025. Personal services \n\nsuch as retail and hospitality will be able to escape the weak \n\nphase of the past years with the revival of private consump­\n\ntion. Gross value added as a whole is also likely to increase \n\nover the course of the year, but stagnate in annual terms. In \n\n2025, it is likely to experience strong growth of 1.2 percent.\n\nThe development on the production side is also likely to be \n\nsupported by an increase in the labor volume, which itself \n\nwill be supported by the continuous increase in employment \n\nover 2024. The number of hours worked per employee is also \n\nlikely to increase over the course of 2024, with a normaliza­\n\ntion of the still significantly higher sick rate being the pri­\n\nmary contributing factor. In the context of a further increase \n\nin the number of hours worked in line with the pre-corona­\n\nvirus trend, a significant increase in the labor volume is also \n\nexpected in 2025. However, the shortage of labor and skilled \n\nworkers, which is intensifying as a result of demographic \n\nchange, is likely to have a limiting effect. In line with the eco­\n\nnomic development, unemployment is likely to rise moder­\n\nately at first and then fall again from the second half of 2024 \n\nonwards, meaning that the unemployment rate should still be \n\n5.9 percent in 2024 and then only 5.5 percent in 2025 (Table 3).\n\nIt can be assumed that the labor force potential will decline \n\ntowards the end of the forecast horizon despite immigra­\n\ntion and rising employment rates, thus limiting potential \n\noutput. Potential output is likely to grow at a rate of 0.5 per­\n\ncent and 0.4 percent in 2024 and 2025, respectively. By the \n\nend of the 2020s, the rate should gradually fall to 0.3 per­\n\ncent. The expected output gap thus will initially increase \n\nfurther to 1.5 percent in 2024 before falling considerably to \n\n0.7 percent in 2025.\n\nOverall, real GDP will probably stagnate in 2024 despite the \n\nincreasing momentum over the course of the year. A strong \n\n1.2-percent increase is expected for 2025.\n\nThis forecast is subject to many uncertainty factors. For \n\nexample, inflation rates in the euro area could increase \n\nagain, either through stronger increases in nominal wages \n\nTable 3\n\nKey economic indicators for the German economy\n\n2023\n\n2024\n\n2025\n\nGDP1\n\n−0.3\n\n−0.0\n\n1.2\n\nEmployment2 (1,000 persons)\n\n45,933\n\n46,067\n\n46,109\n\nUnemployed (1,000 persons)\n\n2,609\n\n2,721\n\n2,565\n\nUnemployment3 (BA concept, in percent)\n\n5.7\n\n5.9\n\n5.5\n\nConsumer prices4\n\n5.9\n\n2.3\n\n2.0\n\nUnit labor costs5\n\n6.7\n\n5.2\n\n2.0\n\nGross labor income2 per employee\n\n6.1\n\n4.5\n\n3.2\n\nCollective wage (monthly)\n\n3.6\n\n4.3\n\n2.1\n\nGovernment budget balance6\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nin billions of euros\n\n−87.4\n\n−51.4\n\n−29.7\n\nin percent of nominal GDP\n\n−2.1\n\n−1.2\n\n−0.7\n\nCurrent account balance\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nin billions of euros\n\n248.4\n\n302.9\n\n306.4\n\nin percent of nominal GDP\n\n6.0\n\n7.1\n\n7.0\n\n1 Price adjusted.

Be er financ­\n\ning conditions and he slowdown in price momentum are likely \n\nto somewha boos both private consumption as well as corpo­\n\nrate investments over he course of 2024. Nevertheless, here \n\nis currently still a grea deal of uncertainty, particular in regard \n\nto he future economic policy environment, which is causing \n\nhouseholds and companies o remain cautious in Germany. \n\nIn addition, fiscal policy stimuli as well as foreign demand are \n\nlacking. German GDP will virtually stagnate and, carried by \n\nprivate consumption and public investments in equipment, \n\nincrease more markedly by 1.2 percen in 2025. The global \n\neconomy will continue o develop more robustly han Ger­\n\nmany; i is projected o increase by 3.5 percen in both 2024 \n\nand 2025, which should gradually strengthen German exports.\n\nGlobal economy: Industry fighting its way ou of a \n\nslump, geopolitical risks are high\n\nThe global economy expanded by 3.9  percen in 2023 \n\n(Figure 1). Growth is subdued compared o historical stand­\n\nards, bu nevertheless robus given he prevailing challenges. \n\nIn many places, high energy prices, higher interes rates, a \n\nloss of purchasing power due o inflation, and geopolitical \n\ncrises and uncertainties weighed on economic development. \n\nIn mos countries, his weakened he industrial sector in par­\n\nticular, while services fared somewha be er.\n\nThe advanced economies, especially he United States, did \n\nprovide a boos o he global economy. The US economy \n\nexperienced a surprisingly strong expansion of 2.5 percen \n\n(Table 1). Comprehensive fiscal policy stimuli from 2020 o \n\n2022 continued o suppor private consumption and corpo­\n\nrate investments. Of he emerging economies, China con­\n\ntributed significantly o global growth: The Chinese econ­\n\nomy grew by 5.2 percen in 2023. Compared o he pre-pan­\n\ndemic years, however, his growth was considerably weaker. \n\nIn 2023, he recovery following he zero COVID policy was \n\novershadowed by lasting problems in he real estate sector \n\nin particular. The Mexican economy grew by 3.2 percen in \n\n2023, although exports o he United States have no been \n\nas dynamic of late.

The Purchasing Managers' Indices \n\nfor manufacturing have recorded an upward rend in mos \n\nadvanced economies recently, despite he fac ha he \n\nmajor euro area Member States and he UK are still below \n\nthe expansion hreshold. In he emerging economies, he \n\nPurchasing Managers' Index for China (Caixin) has been \n\nabove he expansion hreshold since November 2023 and \n\nin Brazil since December 2023. Industry, which has been \n\nweak globally, should hus gradually overcome his slump. \n\nHowever, manufacturing continues o be weak, especially in \n\nJapan and Germany. While his is due o he high costs for \n\nimports given he weak yen and subdued domestic demand \n\nin Japan, high energy prices and weak foreign demand are \n\nweighing on he developmen in Germany.\n\nIn he United States, growth is likely o slow somewha o \n\n0.5 percen (annualized 1.9 percent) in he firs quarter of \n\n2024. The South Korean economy is expanding a a simi­\n\nlar rate, driven by strong semiconductor exports. The euro \n\narea as well as he UK are likely o gradually recover, with \n\nquarterly growth of 0.1 percent. Japan's economy is likely o \n\nonly grow by 0.4 percen due o persistently high inflation.\n\nIn mos emerging economies, in contrast, strong growth \n\nis expected in he firs quarter of 2024 (Table 1). In China, \n\nconsumers spen considerably more money around he \n\nLunar New Year holiday as compared o before he pan­\n\ndemic; ouris raffic and ourism expanded as well. The \n\nChinese economy is likely o expand by 1.0 percen in he \n\nfirs quarter of 2024. Economic outpu in he Central and \n\nEastern European countries of he European Union will \n\nlikely expand by 0.7 percen in he firs quarter of 2024 due \n\nto falling inflation rates and stronger consumption, a slightly \n\ngreater increase han recently.\n\nInternational rade will probably experience only moderate \n\ngrowth in 2024.

International rade declined \n\nby 1.9 percen in 2023.\n\nMonetary policy in many advanced economies, excep for \n\nJapan, will remain restrictive a he beginning of 2024. \n\nHowever, as inflations rates are falling in he euro area, \n\nthe European Central Bank is expected o make its firs key \n\ninteres rate cu in early summer. Lending o households \n\nhas also stabilized recently.2 In he United States, inflation \n\ndid no decline further in January 2024, primarily due o \n\n2 Cf.

Thus, an initial interes rate decrease in \n\nMarch, as widely expected by financial markets, is no longer \n\nlikely. In many emerging economies, monetary policy has \n\nalready been loosened: The Chinese central bank lowered \n\nthe five-year key interes rate for mortgages, a further sup­\n\nportive measure for he country’s struggling real estate sec­\n\ntor. Weak domestic demand is also reflected by a deflation­\n\nary rend in China, where prices fell by a further 0.8 per­\n\ncen in January 2024.\n\nFiscal policy will likely only provide moderate stimuli for he \n\neconomy during he forecas period. In ligh of higher inter­\n\nes rates, many governments are holding back on additional \n\nspending, partly o comply with fiscal defici and deb rules. \n\nHowever, he federal defici remains high in he United States \n\nand will be considerably above five percen of economic out­\n\npu in 2024 and 2025.

After \n\neconomic outpu stagnated for hree quarters in 2023, i fell \n\nin he final quarter, down by 0.3 percen quarter on quarter, \n\nand in he year as a whole by 0.3 percen as well. While for­\n\neign demand declined due o weak global industrial produc­\n\ntion, repeated interes rate hikes by he European Central \n\nBank (ECB) and high inflation rates dampened domestic \n\ndemand. Although consumer prices have had almos con­\n\nsistently lower growth rates since he beginning of 2023, in \n\nparticular due o falling energy prices, he annual average \n\ninflation rate was still 5.9 percent.\n\nNevertheless, high wage agreements over he course of 2023 \n\nled o a sligh increase in real wages. However, his increase \n\ncould no compensate for consumers’ previous loss of pur­\n\nchasing power. The developmen of incomes and prices led \n\nto lasting uncertainty, which dampened consumer senti­\n\nmen and caused private consumption o fall markedly in \n\n2023 as a whole. Rising nominal interes rates are also pro­\n\nviding incentives o save, which has further increased he \n\nalready high savings rate.\n\nFinancing costs also rose due o he interes rate hikes and \n\ndampened investmen activity of private households and \n\nenterprises. Construction investments in particular declined \n\nconsiderably, especially due o weakening private residen­\n\ntial construction. A he same ime, investments in equip­\n\nmen likely benefited from he high order backlog, a resul \n\nof he recovery following he coronavirus pandemic, and \n\nincreased overall. In contrast, weak foreign demand weighed \n\non exports. However, as imports declined even more sharply \n\ndue o high energy prices and low demand for foreign inter­\n\nmediary goods from domestic industry, he rade balance \n\nwas positive.\n\nDespite he weak economic situation, employmen reached \n\nan all-time high with an annual average of 45.9 million people \n\nin employment. Primarily migration made his employmen \n\ngrowth possible. The additional jobs in healthcare, educa­\n\ntion, and public administration created by he federal, state, \n\nand local governments also played a role. Simultaneously, \n\nthe number of registered unemployed increased and he \n\nunemploymen rate grew from 5.3 percen in 2022 o 5.7 per­\n\ncen in 2023.\n\nThe gross value added, especially in manufacturing, was in \n\ndecline over he second half of 2023. Energy-intensive sec­\n\ntors in particular suffered due o he permanently height­\n\nened energy prices.\n\nWeak star o 2024\n\nThe same factors are still expected o weigh on he German \n\neconomy in he firs quarter of 2024, resulting in a 0.1-percen \n\ndecline in economic outpu (Figure 2). Thus, he German \n\neconomy will likely contrac for he hird quarter in a row \n\n(Table 2).4\n\nNominal wages and disposable income continue heir \n\nstrong upward rend and inflation rates are declining more \n\nand more, which results in higher purchasing power. \n\nNevertheless, consumer sentimen among private house­\n\nholds remains subdued and is characterized by uncertainty \n\nabou economic developments.5 This can be seen in, for \n\nexample, he GfK-Konsumklimaindex, which is currently stag­\n\nnating in he negatives. Retail sales also declined again in \n\nJanuary 2024. Thus, private consumption is likely o experi­\n\nence only minimal growth and will be unable o preven a \n\ndecline in GDP in he firs quarter of 2024 (Table 2).\n\nIn contrast, sligh negative stimuli are expected from invest­\n\nments in he firs quarter of 2024. While manufacturers of \n\ncapital goods still have a large stock of existing orders, new \n\norders are rending downward; only some bulk orders are \n\ninterrupting his rend. The ifo Business Climate Index for \n\nGermany is also no suggesting he situation will improve \n\nin he shor erm. Thus, investments in equipmen are likely \n\nto fall in he firs quarter of 2024. In he area of construction \n\n4 Economic performance already began declining in he hird quarter of 2023, even if only \n\n marginally by 0.01 percent. Thus, he German economy has been in a echnical recession since he \n\nfourth quarter of 2023.\n\n5 For example, he Economic Policy Uncertainty Index for Germany has increased noticeably \n\nsince May 2023 and has since remained markedly above he overall European index values.\n\nFigure 2\n\nReal GDP growth in Germany \n\nIn billions of euros (lef axis) and quarter-on-quarter in percen \n\n(righ axis)\n\n \n\nNote: Forecas from he firs quarter of 2024; adjusted for price, seasonal, and calendar effects. \n\nSources: Federal Statistical Office; DIW Berlin Economic Outlook Spring 2024. \n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nAfter stagnating in 2024, he economy is projected o pick up again significantly \n\nin 2025. \n\n90\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 10+11/2024\n\nDIW BERLIN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK\n\nFigure 3\n\nGDP and importan components \n\nSeasonally, calendar, and price-adjusted development\n\n \n\nNote: Forecas from he firs quarter of 2024; adjusted for price, seasonal, and calendar effects. \n\nSources: Federal Statistical Office; DIW Berlin Economic Outlook Spring 2024.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\n91\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 10+11/2024\n\nDIW BERLIN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK\n\ninvestment, residential construction in particular is likely o \n\nremain weak in he firs quarter of 2024 due o persistently \n\nhigh interes rates. In ligh of a historically low number of \n\nincoming orders and building permits as well as a stagnation \n\nin new credi volume, a continued marked decline is expected \n\nhere. Only non-residential construction (especially civil engi­\n\nneering) may have a supporting effec and somewha cush­\n\nion he renewed decline in construction investment.\n\nAs of he beginning of 2024, foreign rade is also no pro­\n\nviding any growth stimuli; both imports as well as exports \n\nare likely o decline in he firs quarter and no contribute o \n\neconomic outpu overall. While a majority of he Purchasing \n\nManagers’ Indices in other European countries are rending \n\nupward again, he values are often still in he negatives. A \n\nrecovery in foreign industrial production, which could ben­\n\nefi German exports, is herefore unlikely o materialize in \n\nthe firs quarter, meaning ha exports will probably continue \n\nto decline. Furthermore, leading indicators for he German \n\nmanufacturing industry, such as capacity utilization and he \n\nGerman Purchasing Managers’ Index, sugges ha imports \n\nof intermediary goods may also decline again (Figure 3).\n\nConsumption picking up speed, supported \n\nby investments\n\nFrom he second quarter of 2024, factors weighing on domes­\n\ntic and foreign demand should begin o weaken. Following \n\nthe decline in inflation rates in 2023, which was primarily \n\ndue o falling energy prices, weakening price pressure on \n\nfood and non-energy goods will likely have a greater effec \n\non inflation in 2024. Overall, inflation in Germany and in \n\nthe euro area is expected o reach he ECB’s wo-percen \n\ntarge within 2024. The European Central Bank is here­\n\nfore expected o herald a urnaround in interes rates a he \n\nend of he second quarter. Falling interes rates are likely \n\nto decrease financing costs for companies and households \n\nand make saving more una ractive. Simultaneously, indus­\n\ntry worldwide will slowly crawl ou of its slump and stimu­\n\nlate foreign demand.\n\nPrivate consumption is likely o be he main driver of he \n\neconomic upswing for he remainder of he forecas period. \n\nThe continuing slowdown in price momentum, which will \n\nstrengthen consumer confidence, will probably make a key \n\ncontribution o his. Real wages are expected o continue o \n\nrise, gradually over he forecas horizon, compensating for he \n\nloss of purchasing power in he pas years.

The sligh decline anticipated in construction \n\nprices from he record highs in recen years should hen also \n\nboos demand somewhat. Non-residential construction will \n\nprobably continue o benefi primarily from investments in \n\ncivil engineering, above all in rail and road construction, and \n\npreven an even greater slump in construction investment. \n\nNon-residential construction is expected o suppor momen­\n\ntum in construction investmen in 2025 as well.\n\nInvestments in equipmen over he course of he forecas \n\nperiod are expected o be significantly determined by pub­\n\nlic defense spending and should be supporting economic \n\ngrowth in 2025 in particular. These investments are likely \n\nto massively increase in he second half of 2024 and in 2025 \n\nin particular as a par of he Bundeswehr’s special fund. \n\nMeanwhile, lower growth in acquisition expenditure is \n\nexpected from private investors. For example, according o \n\nDIHK surveys, corporate willingness o inves has recently \n\nfallen repeatedly. This is due o, among other hings, uncer­\n\ntainties regarding long-term economic policy, for example \n\nin regards o climate and ransition policy.\n\nAs he economies of key German rading partners continue \n\nto recover, German exports are likely o increase again from \n\nthe second half of 2024. Imports are also expected o increase, \n\nsupported by he recovery in he manufacturing industry and \n\nthe related strong foreign demand for intermediary goods. \n\nThis demand will also be significantly stronger in 2025 due \n\nto he expansion of public investments in military equip­\n\nmen and will hen resul in a slightly negative rade balance.\n\nNo clear stimuli are expected from fiscal policy measures in \n\n2024. The reduced consumption axes on natural gas and in \n\nthe food service industry expired a he beginning of 2024 \n\nand he CO2 surcharge was increased. Energy and electricity \n\nsubsidies for private households will end in April. The larg­\n\nes expansionary stimulus will probably come from a consid­\n\nerable increase in defense spending in both 2024 and 2025. \n\nOverall, revenue is likely o increase more strongly han \n\nexpenditure in 2024 and 2025. The public defici will likely \n\ndecline from 1.2 in 2024 o 0.7 percen of GDP in 2025. The \n\ndebt-to-GDP ratio according o he Maastrich Criteria is \n\nlikely o fall from 63.6 o 62.6 percen of GDP.\n\nThe manufacturing industry is likely o recover somewha \n\nover he course of 2024 hanks o momentum in investments \n\nand increase more considerably in 2025. Personal services \n\nsuch as retail and hospitality will be able o escape he weak \n\nphase of he pas years with he revival of private consump­\n\ntion. Gross value added as a whole is also likely o increase \n\nover he course of he year, bu stagnate in annual erms. In \n\n2025, i is likely o experience strong growth of 1.2 percent.\n\nThe developmen on he production side is also likely o be \n\nsupported by an increase in he labor volume, which itself \n\nwill be supported by he continuous increase in employmen \n\nover 2024. The number of hours worked per employee is also \n\nlikely o increase over he course of 2024, with a normaliza­\n\ntion of he still significantly higher sick rate being he pri­\n\nmary contributing factor. In he contex of a further increase \n\nin he number of hours worked in line with he pre-corona­\n\nvirus rend, a significan increase in he labor volume is also \n\nexpected in 2025. However, he shortage of labor and skilled \n\nworkers, which is intensifying as a resul of demographic \n\nchange, is likely o have a limiting effect. In line with he eco­\n\nnomic development, unemploymen is likely o rise moder­\n\nately a firs and hen fall again from he second half of 2024 \n\nonwards, meaning ha he unemploymen rate should still be \n\n5.9 percen in 2024 and hen only 5.5 percen in 2025 (Table 3).\n\nI can be assumed ha he labor force potential will decline \n\ntowards he end of he forecas horizon despite immigra­\n\ntion and rising employmen rates, hus limiting potential \n\noutput. Potential outpu is likely o grow a a rate of 0.5 per­\n\ncen and 0.4 percen in 2024 and 2025, respectively. By he \n\nend of he 2020s, he rate should gradually fall o 0.3 per­\n\ncent. The expected outpu gap hus will initially increase \n\nfurther o 1.5 percen in 2024 before falling considerably o \n\n0.7 percen in 2025.\n\nOverall, real GDP will probably stagnate in 2024 despite he \n\nincreasing momentum over he course of he year. A strong \n\n1.2-percen increase is expected for 2025.\n\nThis forecas is subjec o many uncertainty factors.
