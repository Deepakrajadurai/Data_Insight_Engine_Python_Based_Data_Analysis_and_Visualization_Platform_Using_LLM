A Renewable Energy Pool (RE-Pool), \n\nwherein the favorable conditions of competitive tenders for \n\nnew wind and solar power projects are passed on to electricity \n\nconsumers, could hedge such price risks. Consumers’ electric­\n\nity prices are thus hedged for the share of their consumption \n\nthat corresponds to the RE-Pool’s generation profile. This, in \n\nturn, strengthens the incentives to invest in flexibility, such as \n\nin heat storage systems or batteries, in order to adjust their \n\ndemand to wind and solar electricity production in the pool. In \n\naddition, the RE-Pool profile can serve as a reference against \n\nwhich new products to hedge flexibility can be introduced in \n\nthe futures and forward markets. The RE-Pool also addresses \n\nfinancing risks linked to regulatory uncertainties faced by \n\nrenewable energy projects. This reduces financing costs and \n\nthus costs for consumers and enhances confidence in future \n\nrenewable deployment and thus supports investments into \n\nthe supply chain of project developers and manufacturers. The \n\nRE-Pool contributes to an even better use of renewable energy \n\nsources in the energy supply and prepares the electricity \n\nsystem for a future powered by a greater share of renewable \n\nenergy.\n\nThe electricity generation costs1 for renewable energy sources \n\nhave decreased considerably over the past years. For exam­\n\nple, costs declined by 89 percent for solar installations, by \n\n69 percent for onshore wind installations, and by 59 percent \n\nfor offshore wind installations from 2010 to 2022 (Figure 1).2 \n\nAlthough over half of the electricity supply now comes from \n\nrenewable energy sources,3 their declining costs4 could not \n\nprotect electricity consumers against the price shocks on \n\nthe gas and coal markets in the past years. This is due to \n\nthe pricing mechanism on the electricity market, where the \n\nmost expensive installation determines the power price in \n\neach hour. This means that the generation costs of gas and \n\ncoal-fired power plants continue to determine the price of \n\nthe electricity supply in most hours.\n\nThe geopolitical situation as well as the future develop­\n\nment of energy and climate policy remain uncertain. Fossil \n\nfuel price shocks cannot be ruled out in the coming years, \n\neven if prices have declined recently. This uncertainty is \n\nalso reflected in the expectations of companies as electricity \n\nconsumers in the European Union. In a 2023 survey con­\n\nducted by the European Investment Bank, 59 percent of \n\ncompanies expressed major concern about energy prices \n\nand 47 percent were worried about uncertainty regarding \n\nprice development.5\n\nIn principle, companies and energy providers can insure \n\nthemselves against fluctuating prices by concluding long-\n\nterm bilateral power purchasing agreements (PPAs) with \n\nelectricity producers through which prices and delivery \n\n1 \n\nThe generation costs, or the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), is a common measure for com­\n\nparing the costs of different electricity generation technologies. Both the installation costs and \n\nall variable costs are compared to the amount of electricity produced by a system over the entire \n\n operating period.\n\n2 International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Renewable Power Generation Costs in 2022, \n\nInternational Renewable Energy Agency (Abu Dhabi: 2023) (available online; accessed on March 20, \n\n2024 (in German).

However, such bilat­\n\neral contracts contain challenges for many companies, such \n\nas the default risk of the contract partner and collateral that \n\nmust be submitted. In particular, it is risky for energy-inten­\n\nsive companies to hedge the price of a major share of their \n\nelectricity demand via long-term PPAs if the prices of their \n\nfinal output are not insured for a comparable time period. \n\nTherefore, instruments that avoid the problems of such bilat­\n\neral contracts and make the electricity market resilient to \n\nfuture price fluctuations are under discussion.\n\nA Renewable Energy Pool allows electricity \n\nconsumers and renewable energy project \n\ndevelopers to mutually insure against price risks\n\nThe RE-Pool6 consists of three elements (Figure 2). First, a \n\npublicly commissioned agency conducts an auction to tender \n\nlong-term contracts for the output of new wind and solar pro­\n\njects. Second, these contracts are aggregated into a contract \n\npool. The pool includes a diverse portfolio of plants with mul­\n\ntiple technologies and at diverse locations that began oper­\n\nating at different times. Thus, long-term hedging contracts \n\nare aggregated in the RE-Pool, which reduce wind and solar \n\nproject developers’ investment risk. Third, electricity con­\n\nsumers receive a contract for a share of the electricity gener­\n\nated in the pool, thus hedging electricity price risks. In this \n\nconcept, the conditions of the renewable energy projects are \n\npassed on to electricity consumers via the pool. The pool is \n\nbudget-neutral for the federal government.\n\nAn RE-Pool guarantees financing for future wind and solar \n\nprojects and addresses uncertainties that could otherwise \n\nendanger German expansion targets and increase the cost \n\nof the energy transition. At the same time, electricity con­\n\nsumers directly benefit from the cost reductions in renew­\n\nable energy. Affordable and reliable electricity prices are a \n\nprerequisite for further electrification, which is an important \n\ncomponent in many sectors in the transition towards a cli­\n\nmate-neutral economy. Thereby, they contribute to the suc­\n\ncess of the industrial transition. By passing on the benefits \n\nof wind and solar energy directly to electricity consumers, \n\nthe RE-Pool also increases political support for the energy \n\ntransition.\n\nConsumers can benefit from affordable \n\nrenewable energy via an RE-Pool\n\nThe elements of the RE-Pool build upon previously developed \n\nand well understood instruments. The long-term contracts \n\nare awarded to renewable energy plant operators in auctions \n\nby a publicly commissioned entity. The prices of successful \n\nbids define the contract price for the respective hedging of \n\na project’s electricity price risk, as was previously the case \n\nin the auctions according to the German Renewable Energy \n\nAct (EEG). If the market price is lower than this contract \n\n6 The concept of renewable energy pools as well as the calculations in this Weekly Report are \n\nbased on Karsten Neuhoff et al., “Contracting Matters: Hedging Consumers and Producers with a \n\nRenewable Energy Pool,” DIW Diskussionspapier no. 2035 (2023) (available online).\n\nprice during an hour in which the plant is producing elec­\n\ntricity, the difference is paid to the operator. In addition to \n\nthe current German system, the plant operator must reim­\n\nburse the surplus revenue to the RE-Pool in hours in which \n\nthe market price is higher than the contract price. Such \n\nsymmetrical long-term contracts hedge electricity produc­\n\ners against price risks, allowing the projects to be realized \n\nat low financing costs.7\n\nThe previous one-sided hedging via the sliding market pre­\n\nmium for new projects would come to an end with the intro­\n\nduction of the RE-Pool. This motivates developers of new \n\nwind and solar projects to participate in the pool. A further \n\nadvantage of the RE-Pool is the ability to hedge against reg­\n\nulatory uncertainties, such as the introduction of price zones \n\nor local prices.\n\nBy switching to symmetric hedging, the benefits of the sym­\n\nmetrical contracts can be passed on to the consumers. All of \n\nthe long-term contracts are aggregated in the RE Pool, which \n\nis defined by the sum of its generation and average contract \n\nprice. Electricity generated from the RE-Pool is then pro­\n\nportionally allocated to the consumers. Under the previous \n\nsupport regime, consumers only incurred costs that were \n\npassed on via the EEG surcharge and have been paid from \n\n7 Cf. Mats Kröger, Karsten Neuhoff, and Jörn C.

Following the introduc­\n\ntion of symmetric hedging, however, consumers will benefit \n\nfrom payments during periods of high electricity prices. If \n\nsymmetric contract structures had already been introduced \n\nin the past, it would have led to large payments and to a sig­\n\nnificant reduction in the burden on consumers during the \n\nenergy price crisis.8 The advantage of passing on the hedg­\n\ning contracts is that the payments in years with low electric­\n\nity prices do not burden the federal budget as in the previ­\n\nous support regime, as the payments and reimbursements \n\nof pool consumers and electricity producers balance each \n\nother out each period.\n\n8 Cf. Jörn Richstein, Frederik Lettow, and Karsten Neuhoff, “Marktprämie beschert Betreibern \n\nerneuerbarer Energien Zusatzgewinne – Differenzverträge würden VerbraucherInnen entlasten,” \n\nDIW aktuell no. 77 (in German; available online).\n\nAs further auctions are held each year as part of Germany’s \n\nrenewable energy expansion targets, the RE-Pool volume \n\nwould increase steadily over the years. If introduced for all \n\nnew tenders starting from 2025 (Figure 3), the RE-Pool would \n\nconsist of onshore wind and solar power installations in \n\nthe first few years. Due to the longer project development \n\ntimes, offshore wind installations would be added beginning \n\nin 2029. In this case, over 100 TWh of generation could be \n\nhedged via the pool from 2028 if Germany’s renewable tar­\n\ngets are reached. The exact price of the RE-Pool depends on \n\nthe generation costs of different renewable energy technol­\n\nogies and sites reflected in the bidding process. By weight­\n\ning the forecasted technology-specific generation costs9 with \n\nthe respective pool volumes, suggests that pool prices in the \n\nrange of 50 to 60 euros per megawatt hour.\n\nAn important question is what risks electricity consum­\n\ners are assuming when participating in an RE-Pool, espe­\n\ncially if electricity prices fall below the prices in the RE-Pool \n\nin the long term. Such a price drop could happen if renew­\n\nable energy generation costs continue to fall or renewable \n\nelectricity projects outside the pool would be subsidized. In \n\nprinciple, this could lead to a structural disadvantage for \n\ncompanies participating in the pool. This can be avoided if \n\nelectricity consumers in the pool receive an exit option, for \n\nexample with a five-year notice period. In case of an exit, the \n\nfederal government, as guarantor of the RE-Pool, would have \n\nto cover the costs of the remaining contracts. This creates a \n\nde facto regulatory guarantee from the federal government \n\nto the companies in the RE-Pool, which protects them from \n\ndisadvantages due to future regulatory measures like a sub­\n\nsidy for installations outside of the pool. On the other hand, \n\na long notice period, for example five years, ensures that con­\n\nsumers remain in the pool and committed to the deal of a \n\nmutual insurance of producers and consumers also in peri­\n\nods of temporarily lower whole-sale prices.\n\nRE-Pool access should prioritize consumer \n\nsegments particularly affected by the transition\n\nThere are various options for allocating the electricity gen­\n\nerated in the RE-Pool among the consumers: “pro-rata” allo­\n\ncation, auctions, or prioritization.\n\nUnder a “pro-rata” allocation, all electricity consumers are \n\nhedged according to their share of total electricity consump­\n\ntion. This would be the simplest and most plausible method \n\nin the long term. However, it would not provide sufficient \n\nhedging for groups of priority consumers who will be par­\n\nticularly affected in the coming years, as the RE-Pool volume \n\nmust first be built up. A second option would be to allocate \n\nthe RE-Pool via an auction. This would lead to the companies \n\nthat are able to pay the most receiving access to the hedge. \n\nThis would not necessarily benefit companies that require \n\nstable and competitive electricity prices in order to invest in \n\ntransition processes.\n\n9 International Energy Agency, World Energy Outlook 2023 (Paris: IEA, 2023) (available online).\n\nFigure 2\n\nSchematic depiction of a renewable energy pool (RE-Pool)\n\n \n\nSources: Karsten Neuhoff et al., “Contracting Matters: Hedging Consumers and Producers with a Renewable Energy \n\nPool,” DIW Diskussionspaper, no. 2035 (2023); authors’ depiction.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nAn RE-Pool enables cost-effective financing of wind and solar energy projects, \n\n allowing the lower costs to be passed on to consumers.\n\n123\n\nDIW Weekly Report 15/2024\n\nRENEWABLE ENERGY POOL\n\nA third possibility is prioritizing allocation to consumer seg­\n\nments that are especially affected by the energy transition. \n\nThis includes companies who are investing in electrifica­\n\ntion processes and thus have a particular need for hedging \n\ntheir electricity costs as well as energy-intensive manufac­\n\nturing companies that are under strong international com­\n\npetitive pressure. The uncertainty of the transition process \n\ncould be reduced for these groups and the necessary invest­\n\nment security increased. A third group consists of the res­\n\nidents living close to new wind and solar parks. Allocation \n\nto this group could increase acceptance for the parks.10 The \n\npublic interest in the projects and their positive externalities \n\nwould justify such prioritized allocation.\n\nDiscussions with stakeholders have revealed a significant \n\ninterest from potential consumers for shares in an RE-Pool. \n\nThus, it can be assumed that the demand for the pool shares \n\nwould exceed supply in the short term and the setting of \n\naccess criteria would likely be a subject to competing inter­\n\nests. However, a similar dynamic is to be expected even with­\n\nout an RE-Pool during times of high electricity prices and \n\nresulting possible government interventions. In any case, it \n\nmust be noted that any decisions about prioritization must \n\nbe discussed and decided upon in an open and transparent \n\nparliamentary process.\n\nRE-Pool offers advantages due to electricity price \n\nsecurity and low financing costs\n\nFor consumers, the RE-Pool offers the advantage of hedg­\n\ning their electricity costs. They are spared high bills in times \n\nof unexpectedly high energy prices, which decreases pres­\n\nsure on the federal government to take action in the mar­\n\nket to lower prices via ad hoc measures or to use budgetary \n\nresources to relieve electricity consumers. During the 2022 \n\nenergy price crisis, an RE-Pool would have led to considerably \n\nlower cost increases for participating consumers (Figure 4).11 \n\nMoreover, hedging electricity price risk is associated with \n\nbetter plannability and investment security. For instance, \n\nprivate homeowners can better calculate the economics of \n\ninstalling a heat pump. For companies it lowers the risk of \n\ninvesting in electrification processes to reduce emissions.\n\nConsumers could theoretically achieve the same effect using \n\nbilateral contracts with electricity suppliers. However, financ­\n\ning costs for wind and solar projects, and thus the elec­\n\ntricity generation costs, would be ten percent higher under \n\nsuch bilateral contracts compared to the RE-Pool, as a DIW \n\nBerlin study shows.12 This is the case because, in contrast to \n\na state-guaranteed contract, the counterparty’s default risk \n\nis greater. In addition, bilateral contracts have a negative \n\n10 Jakob Knauf, “Can’t buy me acceptance? Financial benefits for wind energy projects in \n\n Germany,” Energy Policy 165 (2022): 112924 (available online).\n\n11 The calculations in Figure 4 assume that the average costs in both policy options are the \n\nsame. The figure is thus less a prediction of the pool price and more an illustration of the reduced \n\nelectricity price volatility.\n\n12 Nils May and Karsten Neuhoff, “Financing Power: Impacts of Energy Policies in Changing \n\n Regulatory Environments,” The Energy Journal 42, no. 4 (2021): 131-151 (available online).\n\nimpact on the creditworthiness of companies if they reach \n\na large volume. This increases the financing costs and rep­\n\nresents a further 20-percent cost increase for the renewable \n\nelectricity that has been hedged. Furthermore, not all com­\n\npanies can conclude such bilateral electricity contracts in \n\nthe amount of their actual electricity demand in practice. \n\nThus, the RE-Pool increases the scope of consumers hedged \n\nagainst price fluctuations in the long term and reduces the \n\ncost of the energy transition.\n\nLastly, the RE-Pool has the advantage of a “flatter” generation \n\nprofile compared to bilateral hedging of electricity consum­\n\ners via individual projects. By aggregating all of the wind and \n\nsolar installations in Germany—and in neighboring coun­\n\ntries as well in the medium and long term—the generation \n\nvolatility is reduced. This can be shown schematically for a \n\npool comprised of equal shares of the current German solar \n\nand offshore wind installations compared to generation from \n\nonly onshore wind installations (Figure 5).\n\nRE-Pool creates incentives for flexible electricity \n\ndemand\n\nAnother advantage of an RE-Pool would be that electricity \n\nconsumers would be incentivized to invest in flexibility as \n\nwell as to adjust their demand to short-term price signals dur­\n\ning operation. These incentives arise because consumers are \n\nhedged by their share in the RE-Pool via the RE-Pool’s gen­\n\neration profile. Therefore, they are only fully hedged against \n\nFigure 3\n\nVolume and price development of an RE-Pool\n\nIn terawatt hours (left axis); euros per megawatt hour \n\n(2023, right axis)\n\n \n\nSources: Klaus Mindrup and Karsten Neuhoff, “Eneuerbare Energeien und Flexibilität – Optionen für reduzierte und \n\nverlässliche Stromkosten,” DIW Politikberatung kompakt, no. 197 (2023); calculations based on the German federal \n\ngovernment’s expansion plans for renewable energy sources and predicted generation costs from the 2023 IEA World \n\nEnergy Outlook.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nThe maximum volume of the RE-Pool will already be over 100 terawatt hours in 2028 \n\nif all new projects are aggregated into the pool beginning in 2025.\n\n124\n\nDIW Weekly Report 15/2024\n\nRENEWABLE ENERGY POOL\n\nthe electricity price risk if their demand follows the profile of \n\nthe pool’s generation perfectly. This means that consumers \n\nwith less flexible demand are exposed to the electricity price \n\nrisks of the short-term markets for the share of their demand \n\nthat deviates from the hedge provided by the RE-Pool. This \n\ncreates incentives to tap into cost-effective flexibility poten­\n\ntials, which keeps costs low for electricity consumers and the \n\nentire system. For example, companies can invest in flexibi­\n\nlization of production, for example with storage of heat and \n\nindustrial intermediate products.\n\nThe magnitude of costs incurred by electricity consumers \n\nwith inflexible demand, and thus also the amount of incen­\n\ntives for investments in flexibility, can be illustrated with the \n\nhelp of market value defined as the revenue a plant would \n\nhave obtained if it were to sell all production at the spot price \n\nof each hour (Figure 6). The green area depicts the 12-month \n\nmoving average of the market value of an RE-Pool compared \n\nto the average of the wholesale spot prices. Generally, this \n\nvalue is below 100 percent because the electricity price tends \n\nto be below average when the supply of renewable electricity \n\nis high. The green line represents the electricity costs of flex­\n\nible consumers who can perfectly adjust their demand to the \n\nRE-Pool’s generation profile. Inflexible consumers, in con­\n\ntrast, incur costs, as they must procure electricity outside of \n\nthe hedging via the RE-Pool. This would be the case primarily \n\nin hours of low production from renewable energy sources, \n\nin which the spot market price is higher than the average \n\nprice of the pool. With the hypothetical RE-Pool assumed in \n\nthis example, these costs (gray area) would currently be just \n\nunder 20 percent of the electricity price for electricity cus­\n\ntomers with completely inflexible demand.\n\nHedging with the RE-Pool’s generation profile does not only \n\nlead to incentives in increasing demand flexibility, but should \n\nalso contribute to further developing the electricity derivatives \n\nmarket. Each company can decide to what extent it invests \n\nin its own flexibility or hedges through the forwards and \n\nfutures market. In turn, this demand for forward products \n\nfor flexibility allows flexibility providers to secure revenue \n\nfrom the flexible operation of batteries or heat storage sys­\n\ntems and thus improves investment framework conditions.\n\nDesign of RE-Pool should be compatible with \n\nfuture electricity market reforms\n\nWhen designing the tender procedures and long-term con­\n\ntracts between the RE-Pool and wind and solar projects, it \n\nmust be ensured that installations are built and operated \n\nin a system-friendly manner and that plants do not pro­\n\nduce in periods of negative electricity prices. There are var­\n\nious options for this: One is to hedge the hourly electricity \n\nprice for producers but have clear regulations stipulating \n\nthat plants do not receive any remuneration during hours \n\nof negative electricity prices. However, this would result in \n\na loss of revenue that is difficult to predict. A further option \n\nfor lowering producers’ revenue risk would be to hedge the \n\npotential generation output during hours of negative elec­\n\ntricity prices instead of the actual output of the plant. This \n\nFigure 4\n\nElectricity costs with an RE-Pool compared to procurement \n\nwithout hedging\n\nIn euros per megawatt hour\n\n \n\nNotes: Electricity costs without hedging calculated using price and demand data from 2015 to 2022; with pool also \n\nbased on RE generation from 2015 to 2022; with flexibility based on a “spread product” that pays the difference \n\nbetween the four highest and lowest hours; same average costs in the scenarios.\n\nSources: Karsten Neuhoff et al., “Contracting Matters: Hedging Consumers and Producers with a Renewable Energy \n\nPool,” DIW Diskussionspaper, no. 2035 (2023); authors’ depiction.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nThe RE-Pool stabilizes the electricity costs across the observation period.\n\n125\n\nDIW Weekly Report 15/2024\n\nRENEWABLE ENERGY POOL\n\nwould restore incentives and maintain revenue security and \n\nlow financing costs. Various research groups have made com­\n\nparable proposals in recent months, all of which are based \n\non decoupling the payments for symmetrical hedging from \n\nthe actual production decisions of the plant operators.13 An \n\nRE-Pool is also compatible with these proposals.\n\nThe design of the RE-Pool should be chosen in such a way \n\nthat electricity consumers are hedged against regulatory \n\nuncertainties regarding possible future electricity market \n\nreforms. One example of this is the introduction of local \n\nprices or electricity price zones, which could replace the \n\nGerman single price zone to better align electricity demand \n\nand supply at a local level and thus avoid transmission con­\n\nstraints. The contracts in the RE-Pool should be specified \n\nin such a way that both electricity producers and consum­\n\ners in the RE-Pool are directly hedged against the electricity \n\nprice at their feed-in or purchase point. However, this could \n\nhave the effect that the payments to and from the RE-Pool no \n\nlonger balance each other out. The resulting revenues from \n\nintroducing locational pricing should be used to eliminate \n\nthese price differences.14 This would secure budget neutral­\n\nity of the RE-Pool.\n\nConclusion: An RE-Pool hedges both electricity \n\nproducers and consumers against price risks\n\nAn RE-Pool is an attractive option for passing on the advan­\n\ntages of electricity producers’ hedged electricity prices to the \n\nconsumers. In an RE-Pool, long-term hedging contracts that \n\nlower the investment risk of wind and solar project devel­\n\nopers are aggregated into a contract pool. In a second step, \n\nthis advantage is passed on to the electricity consumers. By \n\nlowering the investment risk, the pool reduces the financ­\n\ning costs for renewable energy projects and thus costs for \n\nrenewables to consumers. It makes it possible for electricity \n\nconsumers to hedge themselves against future price shocks. \n\nFurthermore, it supports investments in flexibility and the \n\ndevelopment of financial hedging products compatible with \n\nrenewable energy sources.

A Renewable Energy Pool (RE-Pool), \n\nwherein he favorable conditions of competitive enders for \n\nnew wind and solar power projects are passed on o electricity \n\nconsumers, could hedge such price risks. Consumers’ electric­\n\nity prices are hus hedged for he share of heir consumption \n\ntha corresponds o he RE-Pool’s generation profile. This, in \n\nturn, strengthens he incentives o inves in flexibility, such as \n\nin hea storage systems or ba eries, in order o adjus heir \n\ndemand o wind and solar electricity production in he pool. In \n\naddition, he RE-Pool profile can serve as a reference agains \n\nwhich new products o hedge flexibility can be introduced in \n\nthe futures and forward markets. The RE-Pool also addresses \n\nfinancing risks linked o regulatory uncertainties faced by \n\nrenewable energy projects. This reduces financing costs and \n\nthus costs for consumers and enhances confidence in future \n\nrenewable deploymen and hus supports investments into \n\nthe supply chain of projec developers and manufacturers. The \n\nRE-Pool contributes o an even be er use of renewable energy \n\nsources in he energy supply and prepares he electricity \n\nsystem for a future powered by a greater share of renewable \n\nenergy.\n\nThe electricity generation costs1 for renewable energy sources \n\nhave decreased considerably over he pas years. For exam­\n\nple, costs declined by 89 percen for solar installations, by \n\n69 percen for onshore wind installations, and by 59 percen \n\nfor offshore wind installations from 2010 o 2022 (Figure 1).2 \n\nAlthough over half of he electricity supply now comes from \n\nrenewable energy sources,3 heir declining costs4 could no \n\nprotec electricity consumers agains he price shocks on \n\nthe gas and coal markets in he pas years. This is due o \n\nthe pricing mechanism on he electricity market, where he \n\nmos expensive installation determines he power price in \n\neach hour. This means ha he generation costs of gas and \n\ncoal-fired power plants continue o determine he price of \n\nthe electricity supply in mos hours.\n\nThe geopolitical situation as well as he future develop­\n\nmen of energy and climate policy remain uncertain. Fossil \n\nfuel price shocks canno be ruled ou in he coming years, \n\neven if prices have declined recently. This uncertainty is \n\nalso reflected in he expectations of companies as electricity \n\nconsumers in he European Union. In a 2023 survey con­\n\nducted by he European Investmen Bank, 59 percen of \n\ncompanies expressed major concern abou energy prices \n\nand 47 percen were worried abou uncertainty regarding \n\nprice development.5\n\nIn principle, companies and energy providers can insure \n\nthemselves agains fluctuating prices by concluding long-\n\nterm bilateral power purchasing agreements (PPAs) with \n\nelectricity producers hrough which prices and delivery \n\n1 \n\nThe generation costs, or he levelized cos of electricity (LCOE), is a common measure for com­\n\nparing he costs of differen electricity generation echnologies. Both he installation costs and \n\nall variable costs are compared o he amoun of electricity produced by a system over he entire \n\n operating period.\n\n2 International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), Renewable Power Generation Costs in 2022, \n\nInternational Renewable Energy Agency (Abu Dhabi: 2023) (available online; accessed on March 20, \n\n2024 (in German).

However, such bilat­\n\neral contracts contain challenges for many companies, such \n\nas he defaul risk of he contrac partner and collateral ha \n\nmus be submi ed. In particular, i is risky for energy-inten­\n\nsive companies o hedge he price of a major share of heir \n\nelectricity demand via long-term PPAs if he prices of heir \n\nfinal outpu are no insured for a comparable ime period. \n\nTherefore, instruments ha avoid he problems of such bilat­\n\neral contracts and make he electricity marke resilien o \n\nfuture price fluctuations are under discussion.\n\nA Renewable Energy Pool allows electricity \n\nconsumers and renewable energy projec \n\ndevelopers o mutually insure agains price risks\n\nThe RE-Pool6 consists of hree elements (Figure 2). First, a \n\npublicly commissioned agency conducts an auction o ender \n\nlong-term contracts for he outpu of new wind and solar pro­\n\njects. Second, hese contracts are aggregated into a contrac \n\npool. The pool includes a diverse portfolio of plants with mul­\n\ntiple echnologies and a diverse locations ha began oper­\n\nating a differen imes. Thus, long-term hedging contracts \n\nare aggregated in he RE-Pool, which reduce wind and solar \n\nprojec developers’ investmen risk. Third, electricity con­\n\nsumers receive a contrac for a share of he electricity gener­\n\nated in he pool, hus hedging electricity price risks. In his \n\nconcept, he conditions of he renewable energy projects are \n\npassed on o electricity consumers via he pool. The pool is \n\nbudget-neutral for he federal government.\n\nAn RE-Pool guarantees financing for future wind and solar \n\nprojects and addresses uncertainties ha could otherwise \n\nendanger German expansion argets and increase he cos \n\nof he energy ransition. A he same ime, electricity con­\n\nsumers directly benefi from he cos reductions in renew­\n\nable energy. Affordable and reliable electricity prices are a \n\nprerequisite for further electrification, which is an importan \n\ncomponen in many sectors in he ransition owards a cli­\n\nmate-neutral economy. Thereby, hey contribute o he suc­\n\ncess of he industrial ransition. By passing on he benefits \n\nof wind and solar energy directly o electricity consumers, \n\nthe RE-Pool also increases political suppor for he energy \n\ntransition.\n\nConsumers can benefi from affordable \n\nrenewable energy via an RE-Pool\n\nThe elements of he RE-Pool build upon previously developed \n\nand well understood instruments. The long-term contracts \n\nare awarded o renewable energy plan operators in auctions \n\nby a publicly commissioned entity. The prices of successful \n\nbids define he contrac price for he respective hedging of \n\na project’s electricity price risk, as was previously he case \n\nin he auctions according o he German Renewable Energy \n\nAc (EEG). If he marke price is lower han his contrac \n\n6 The concep of renewable energy pools as well as he calculations in his Weekly Repor are \n\nbased on Karsten Neuhoff e al., “Contracting Ma ers: Hedging Consumers and Producers with a \n\nRenewable Energy Pool,” DIW Diskussionspapier no. 2035 (2023) (available online).\n\nprice during an hour in which he plan is producing elec­\n\ntricity, he difference is paid o he operator. In addition o \n\nthe curren German system, he plan operator mus reim­\n\nburse he surplus revenue o he RE-Pool in hours in which \n\nthe marke price is higher han he contrac price. Such \n\nsymmetrical long-term contracts hedge electricity produc­\n\ners agains price risks, allowing he projects o be realized \n\na low financing costs.7\n\nThe previous one-sided hedging via he sliding marke pre­\n\nmium for new projects would come o an end with he intro­\n\nduction of he RE-Pool. This motivates developers of new \n\nwind and solar projects o participate in he pool. A further \n\nadvantage of he RE-Pool is he ability o hedge agains reg­\n\nulatory uncertainties, such as he introduction of price zones \n\nor local prices.\n\nBy switching o symmetric hedging, he benefits of he sym­\n\nmetrical contracts can be passed on o he consumers. All of \n\nthe long-term contracts are aggregated in he RE Pool, which \n\nis defined by he sum of its generation and average contrac \n\nprice. Electricity generated from he RE-Pool is hen pro­\n\nportionally allocated o he consumers. Under he previous \n\nsuppor regime, consumers only incurred costs ha were \n\npassed on via he EEG surcharge and have been paid from \n\n7 Cf. Mats Kröger, Karsten Neuhoff, and Jörn C.

Following he introduc­\n\ntion of symmetric hedging, however, consumers will benefi \n\nfrom payments during periods of high electricity prices. If \n\nsymmetric contrac structures had already been introduced \n\nin he past, i would have led o large payments and o a sig­\n\nnifican reduction in he burden on consumers during he \n\nenergy price crisis.8 The advantage of passing on he hedg­\n\ning contracts is ha he payments in years with low electric­\n\nity prices do no burden he federal budge as in he previ­\n\nous suppor regime, as he payments and reimbursements \n\nof pool consumers and electricity producers balance each \n\nother ou each period.\n\n8 Cf. Jörn Richstein, Frederik Le ow, and Karsten Neuhoff, “Marktprämie bescher Betreibern \n\nerneuerbarer Energien Zusatzgewinne – Differenzverträge würden VerbraucherInnen entlasten,” \n\nDIW aktuell no. 77 (in German; available online).\n\nAs further auctions are held each year as par of Germany’s \n\nrenewable energy expansion argets, he RE-Pool volume \n\nwould increase steadily over he years. If introduced for all \n\nnew enders starting from 2025 (Figure 3), he RE-Pool would \n\nconsis of onshore wind and solar power installations in \n\nthe firs few years. Due o he longer projec developmen \n\ntimes, offshore wind installations would be added beginning \n\nin 2029. In his case, over 100 TWh of generation could be \n\nhedged via he pool from 2028 if Germany’s renewable ar­\n\ngets are reached. The exac price of he RE-Pool depends on \n\nthe generation costs of differen renewable energy echnol­\n\nogies and sites reflected in he bidding process. By weight­\n\ning he forecasted echnology-specific generation costs9 with \n\nthe respective pool volumes, suggests ha pool prices in he \n\nrange of 50 o 60 euros per megawa hour.\n\nAn importan question is wha risks electricity consum­\n\ners are assuming when participating in an RE-Pool, espe­\n\ncially if electricity prices fall below he prices in he RE-Pool \n\nin he long erm. Such a price drop could happen if renew­\n\nable energy generation costs continue o fall or renewable \n\nelectricity projects outside he pool would be subsidized. In \n\nprinciple, his could lead o a structural disadvantage for \n\ncompanies participating in he pool. This can be avoided if \n\nelectricity consumers in he pool receive an exi option, for \n\nexample with a five-year notice period. In case of an exit, he \n\nfederal government, as guarantor of he RE-Pool, would have \n\nto cover he costs of he remaining contracts. This creates a \n\nde facto regulatory guarantee from he federal governmen \n\nto he companies in he RE-Pool, which protects hem from \n\ndisadvantages due o future regulatory measures like a sub­\n\nsidy for installations outside of he pool. On he other hand, \n\na long notice period, for example five years, ensures ha con­\n\nsumers remain in he pool and commi ed o he deal of a \n\nmutual insurance of producers and consumers also in peri­\n\nods of emporarily lower whole-sale prices.\n\nRE-Pool access should prioritize consumer \n\nsegments particularly affected by he ransition\n\nThere are various options for allocating he electricity gen­\n\nerated in he RE-Pool among he consumers: “pro-rata” allo­\n\ncation, auctions, or prioritization.\n\nUnder a “pro-rata” allocation, all electricity consumers are \n\nhedged according o heir share of otal electricity consump­\n\ntion. This would be he simples and mos plausible method \n\nin he long erm. However, i would no provide sufficien \n\nhedging for groups of priority consumers who will be par­\n\nticularly affected in he coming years, as he RE-Pool volume \n\nmus firs be buil up. A second option would be o allocate \n\nthe RE-Pool via an auction. This would lead o he companies \n\ntha are able o pay he mos receiving access o he hedge. \n\nThis would no necessarily benefi companies ha require \n\nstable and competitive electricity prices in order o inves in \n\ntransition processes.\n\n9 International Energy Agency, World Energy Outlook 2023 (Paris: IEA, 2023) (available online).\n\nFigure 2\n\nSchematic depiction of a renewable energy pool (RE-Pool)\n\n \n\nSources: Karsten Neuhoff e al., “Contracting Ma ers: Hedging Consumers and Producers with a Renewable Energy \n\nPool,” DIW Diskussionspaper, no. 2035 (2023); authors’ depiction.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nAn RE-Pool enables cost-effective financing of wind and solar energy projects, \n\n allowing he lower costs o be passed on o consumers.\n\n123\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 15/2024\n\nRENEWABLE ENERGY POOL\n\nA hird possibility is prioritizing allocation o consumer seg­\n\nments ha are especially affected by he energy ransition. \n\nThis includes companies who are investing in electrifica­\n\ntion processes and hus have a particular need for hedging \n\ntheir electricity costs as well as energy-intensive manufac­\n\nturing companies ha are under strong international com­\n\npetitive pressure. The uncertainty of he ransition process \n\ncould be reduced for hese groups and he necessary invest­\n\nmen security increased. A hird group consists of he res­\n\nidents living close o new wind and solar parks. Allocation \n\nto his group could increase acceptance for he parks.10 The \n\npublic interes in he projects and heir positive externalities \n\nwould justify such prioritized allocation.\n\nDiscussions with stakeholders have revealed a significan \n\ninteres from potential consumers for shares in an RE-Pool. \n\nThus, i can be assumed ha he demand for he pool shares \n\nwould exceed supply in he shor erm and he se ing of \n\naccess criteria would likely be a subjec o competing inter­\n\nests. However, a similar dynamic is o be expected even with­\n\nou an RE-Pool during imes of high electricity prices and \n\nresulting possible governmen interventions. In any case, i \n\nmus be noted ha any decisions abou prioritization mus \n\nbe discussed and decided upon in an open and ransparen \n\nparliamentary process.\n\nRE-Pool offers advantages due o electricity price \n\nsecurity and low financing costs\n\nFor consumers, he RE-Pool offers he advantage of hedg­\n\ning heir electricity costs. They are spared high bills in imes \n\nof unexpectedly high energy prices, which decreases pres­\n\nsure on he federal governmen o ake action in he mar­\n\nke o lower prices via ad hoc measures or o use budgetary \n\nresources o relieve electricity consumers. During he 2022 \n\nenergy price crisis, an RE-Pool would have led o considerably \n\nlower cos increases for participating consumers (Figure 4).11 \n\nMoreover, hedging electricity price risk is associated with \n\nbe er plannability and investmen security. For instance, \n\nprivate homeowners can be er calculate he economics of \n\ninstalling a hea pump. For companies i lowers he risk of \n\ninvesting in electrification processes o reduce emissions.\n\nConsumers could heoretically achieve he same effec using \n\nbilateral contracts with electricity suppliers. However, financ­\n\ning costs for wind and solar projects, and hus he elec­\n\ntricity generation costs, would be en percen higher under \n\nsuch bilateral contracts compared o he RE-Pool, as a DIW \n\nBerlin study shows.12 This is he case because, in contras o \n\na state-guaranteed contract, he counterparty’s defaul risk \n\nis greater. In addition, bilateral contracts have a negative \n\n10 Jakob Knauf, “Can’ buy me acceptance?

The figure is hus less a prediction of he pool price and more an illustration of he reduced \n\nelectricity price volatility.\n\n12 Nils May and Karsten Neuhoff, “Financing Power: Impacts of Energy Policies in Changing \n\n Regulatory Environments,” The Energy Journal 42, no. 4 (2021): 131-151 (available online).\n\nimpac on he creditworthiness of companies if hey reach \n\na large volume. This increases he financing costs and rep­\n\nresents a further 20-percen cos increase for he renewable \n\nelectricity ha has been hedged. Furthermore, no all com­\n\npanies can conclude such bilateral electricity contracts in \n\nthe amoun of heir actual electricity demand in practice. \n\nThus, he RE-Pool increases he scope of consumers hedged \n\nagains price fluctuations in he long erm and reduces he \n\ncos of he energy ransition.\n\nLastly, he RE-Pool has he advantage of a “fla er” generation \n\nprofile compared o bilateral hedging of electricity consum­\n\ners via individual projects. By aggregating all of he wind and \n\nsolar installations in Germany—and in neighboring coun­\n\ntries as well in he medium and long erm—the generation \n\nvolatility is reduced. This can be shown schematically for a \n\npool comprised of equal shares of he curren German solar \n\nand offshore wind installations compared o generation from \n\nonly onshore wind installations (Figure 5).\n\nRE-Pool creates incentives for flexible electricity \n\ndemand\n\nAnother advantage of an RE-Pool would be ha electricity \n\nconsumers would be incentivized o inves in flexibility as \n\nwell as o adjus heir demand o short-term price signals dur­\n\ning operation. These incentives arise because consumers are \n\nhedged by heir share in he RE-Pool via he RE-Pool’s gen­\n\neration profile. Therefore, hey are only fully hedged agains \n\nFigure 3\n\nVolume and price developmen of an RE-Pool\n\nIn erawa hours (lef axis); euros per megawa hour \n\n(2023, righ axis)\n\n \n\nSources: Klaus Mindrup and Karsten Neuhoff, “Eneuerbare Energeien und Flexibilitä – Optionen für reduzierte und \n\nverlässliche Stromkosten,” DIW Politikberatung kompakt, no. 197 (2023); calculations based on he German federal \n\ngovernment’s expansion plans for renewable energy sources and predicted generation costs from he 2023 IEA World \n\nEnergy Outlook.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nThe maximum volume of he RE-Pool will already be over 100 erawa hours in 2028 \n\nif all new projects are aggregated into he pool beginning in 2025.\n\n124\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 15/2024\n\nRENEWABLE ENERGY POOL\n\nthe electricity price risk if heir demand follows he profile of \n\nthe pool’s generation perfectly. This means ha consumers \n\nwith less flexible demand are exposed o he electricity price \n\nrisks of he short-term markets for he share of heir demand \n\ntha deviates from he hedge provided by he RE-Pool. This \n\ncreates incentives o ap into cost-effective flexibility poten­\n\ntials, which keeps costs low for electricity consumers and he \n\nentire system. For example, companies can inves in flexibi­\n\nlization of production, for example with storage of hea and \n\nindustrial intermediate products.\n\nThe magnitude of costs incurred by electricity consumers \n\nwith inflexible demand, and hus also he amoun of incen­\n\ntives for investments in flexibility, can be illustrated with he \n\nhelp of marke value defined as he revenue a plan would \n\nhave obtained if i were o sell all production a he spo price \n\nof each hour (Figure 6). The green area depicts he 12-month \n\nmoving average of he marke value of an RE-Pool compared \n\nto he average of he wholesale spo prices. Generally, his \n\nvalue is below 100 percen because he electricity price ends \n\nto be below average when he supply of renewable electricity \n\nis high. The green line represents he electricity costs of flex­\n\nible consumers who can perfectly adjus heir demand o he \n\nRE-Pool’s generation profile. Inflexible consumers, in con­\n\ntrast, incur costs, as hey mus procure electricity outside of \n\nthe hedging via he RE-Pool. This would be he case primarily \n\nin hours of low production from renewable energy sources, \n\nin which he spo marke price is higher han he average \n\nprice of he pool. With he hypothetical RE-Pool assumed in \n\nthis example, hese costs (gray area) would currently be jus \n\nunder 20 percen of he electricity price for electricity cus­\n\ntomers with completely inflexible demand.\n\nHedging with he RE-Pool’s generation profile does no only \n\nlead o incentives in increasing demand flexibility, bu should \n\nalso contribute o further developing he electricity derivatives \n\nmarket. Each company can decide o wha exten i invests \n\nin its own flexibility or hedges hrough he forwards and \n\nfutures market.

There are var­\n\nious options for his: One is o hedge he hourly electricity \n\nprice for producers bu have clear regulations stipulating \n\ntha plants do no receive any remuneration during hours \n\nof negative electricity prices. However, his would resul in \n\na loss of revenue ha is difficul o predict. A further option \n\nfor lowering producers’ revenue risk would be o hedge he \n\npotential generation outpu during hours of negative elec­\n\ntricity prices instead of he actual outpu of he plant.

Various research groups have made com­\n\nparable proposals in recen months, all of which are based \n\non decoupling he payments for symmetrical hedging from \n\nthe actual production decisions of he plan operators.13 An \n\nRE-Pool is also compatible with hese proposals.\n\nThe design of he RE-Pool should be chosen in such a way \n\ntha electricity consumers are hedged agains regulatory \n\nuncertainties regarding possible future electricity marke \n\nreforms. One example of his is he introduction of local \n\nprices or electricity price zones, which could replace he \n\nGerman single price zone o be er align electricity demand \n\nand supply a a local level and hus avoid ransmission con­\n\nstraints. The contracts in he RE-Pool should be specified \n\nin such a way ha both electricity producers and consum­\n\ners in he RE-Pool are directly hedged agains he electricity \n\nprice a heir feed-in or purchase point. However, his could \n\nhave he effec ha he payments o and from he RE-Pool no \n\nlonger balance each other out. The resulting revenues from \n\nintroducing locational pricing should be used o eliminate \n\nthese price differences.14 This would secure budge neutral­\n\nity of he RE-Pool.\n\nConclusion: An RE-Pool hedges both electricity \n\nproducers and consumers agains price risks\n\nAn RE-Pool is an a ractive option for passing on he advan­\n\ntages of electricity producers’ hedged electricity prices o he \n\nconsumers. In an RE-Pool, long-term hedging contracts ha \n\nlower he investmen risk of wind and solar projec devel­\n\nopers are aggregated into a contrac pool. In a second step, \n\nthis advantage is passed on o he electricity consumers. By \n\nlowering he investmen risk, he pool reduces he financ­\n\ning costs for renewable energy projects and hus costs for \n\nrenewables o consumers. I makes i possible for electricity \n\nconsumers o hedge hemselves agains future price shocks. \n\nFurthermore, i supports investments in flexibility and he \n\ndevelopmen of financial hedging products compatible with \n\nrenewable energy sources. The RE-Pool is an importan par \n\nof an electricity marke with increasing shares of renewa­\n\nble energy.\n\n13 Cf.

A spli of larger pricing zones or an introduction of \n\nlocational pricing would reduce or eliminate hese costs and instead resul in congestion revenue \n\ntha can be used for reducing grid ariffs and hedging locational price differences in an RE-pool.\n\nFigure 5\n\nProduction profile of a hypothetical pool compared o onshore \n\nwind installations in 2021\n\nIndex of he maximum generation\n\n \n\nSources: Karsten Neuhoff e al., “Contracting Ma ers: Hedging Consumers and Producers with a Renewable Energy \n\nPool,” DIW Diskussionspaper, no. 2035 (2023); authors’ depiction.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nAn RE-Pool ha contains half onshore wind installations and half solar installations \n\nsignificantly reduces production volatility.\n\nFigure 6\n\nElectricity costs for flexible demand\n\nIn percen compared o electricity costs for inflexible demand\n\n \n\nNotes: Twelve-month moving average of he monthly marke values of a hypothetical RE-Pool, weighted with he \n\ngeneration volumes of renewable energy sources from 2023, compared o he spo marke price.
