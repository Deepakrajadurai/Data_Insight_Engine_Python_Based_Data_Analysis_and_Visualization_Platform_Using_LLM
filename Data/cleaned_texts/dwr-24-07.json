This difference, known as the gender \n\ncare gap, varies considerably between European countries, \n\nwith Germany somewhere in the middle of the distribution. \n\nThis Weekly Report analyzes the institutional, societal, and \n\nlabor market factors that are related to the gender care gap \n\nacross European countries. The results show that the gap \n\nis smaller in countries that spend more on the formal care \n\nsystem. In addition, they show that the gender care gap tends \n\nto be larger in countries that exhibit high gender inequality \n\nand high inequality in labor market participation between \n\nmen and women. Thus, the results emphasize that the gender \n\npay gap correlates with government investments in health \n\ncare, the care system, and the labor market structure. \n\nTo reduce the gender care gap, expenditure on formal care \n\nshould be increased to relieve informal caregivers and \n\nimprove the quality of care in professional facilities. At the \n\nsame time, policymakers should use tax and family policy \n\nincentives to increase women’s workforce participation so that \n\npaid work and care work are more evenly distributed.\n\nOne of the key future social and health policy challenges is \n\nthe increasing amount of people requiring care as society \n\nages. Currently, around five million people receive benefits \n\nfrom long-term care insurance in Germany and according \n\nto current estimates, this figure will increase over the com­\n\ning decades.1 The majority of people requiring care receive \n\ncare at home (83 percent). Nearly 14 percent of this majority \n\nbelong to Pflegegrad I (long-term care level I, “minor restric­\n\ntion of independence”) and only receive minimal additional \n\nbenefits from long-term care insurance. Around 60 percent \n\nof people receiving care at home only receive a care allow­\n\nance (Pflegegeld), meaning they organize informal care with­\n\nout professional assistance.2 The other 25 percent of people \n\nrequiring care in their own home organize their care with the \n\nhelp of outpatient nursing and care services, which  usually \n\nalso includes informal care provided by relatives.\n\nInformal care, especially without professional help, is time \n\nconsuming and frequently results in the caretaking rela­\n\ntives reducing or giving up paid employment or ending their \n\nsearch for paid employment. Like childcare, it is mainly \n\nwomen who provide informal care, interrupting their careers \n\nto do so.3 The difference between the amount of informal \n\ncare work performed by men and women is known as the \n\ngender care gap in long-term care.4 In this Weekly Report, \n\nthe shortened term gender care gap is used.5\n\n1 \n\nIn a current estimate, the Federal Statistical Office reports that the number of people \n\n receiving benefits will increase to 6.8 million by 2055 if prevalence rates remain the same. If the \n\n prevalence rates continue to trend upward, the number will be much higher.

Börsch-Supan, Peter Haan, and Elsa Perdrix, “Long-term Care in \n\n Germany,” NBER Working Paper, no. 31870 (2023) (available online)\n\n4 This term does not include other unpaid care work, such as childcare or housework and thus \n\ndiffers from other definitions of the gender care gap. For more, see the DIW Berlin Glossary (in Ger­\n\nman; available online).\n\n5 The large share of women performing care work is reflected in the formal care sector as well. \n\nAccording to OECD evaluations, the average share of women working in professional long-term \n\ncare in OECD countries is around 90 percent. This frequently includes jobs with poor working con­\n\nditions and comparatively low wages (OECD, “Women are well-represented in health and long-\n\nterm care professions, but often in jobs with poor working conditions,” (2019) (available online)).\n\n57\n\nDIW Weekly Report 7/2024\n\nGENDER CARE GAP\n\nThe gender care gap is a significant factor contributing to \n\nemployment and income inequality between men and wom­\n\nen.6 This does not only apply to current income possibilities, \n\nbut also to the amount of future pension entitlements, as they \n\ndirectly depend on how much remuneration subject to pen­\n\nsion insurance a person has earned.7 The differences in pen­\n\nsion entitlements between women and men are often linked \n\nto gender differences in employment histories.8\n\nThe above-average number of women caring for relatives is \n\noften explained by labor market differences between the gen­\n\nders: Women frequently earn less and work fewer hours than \n\ntheir partner, so reducing their hours or quitting their job \n\nto perform caretaking duties reduces the household income \n\nless than if their partner were to work fewer hours or quit. \n\nSocial norms that regard care work as women’s work also \n\ncontribute to the gap. Moreover, the underlying care system \n\nmay be reinforcing the differences in informal care provided \n\nby women and men. For example, a strong welfare state that \n\nspends a significant amount on formal care offers, such as \n\noutpatient care services, adult daycare, or in-patient nursing \n\nhomes, can mitigate gender differences in informal care, as \n\ngenerally less informal care is needed.\n\nThis Weekly Report investigates how the gender care gap in \n\nGermany differs from the gap in other European countries.9 \n\nIt also shows how the gender care gap correlates with govern­\n\nment spending on care as well as with the societal and labor \n\nmarket inequality between men and women. The analysis \n\nuses data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement \n\nin Europe (SHARE), which includes people aged 50 or older \n\nin 17 European countries. In addition to key socio-demo­\n\ngraphic indicators, the data contains detailed information on \n\ninformal care provided (Box on data and sample).10\n\nWomen perform more care work than men in all \n\ncountries analyzed\n\nThis Weekly Report only considers informal care work per­\n\nformed for someone outside of one’s own household—such \n\nas help with getting dressed, bathing or showering, eating \n\nmeals, getting in or out of bed, or using the toilet—when cal­\n\nculating the gender care gap. Caretaking duties performed \n\nfor one’s partner in one’s own household are not considered \n\nhere. The absolute difference between the shares of men \n\nand women acting as informal caregivers is adjusted for age \n\n6 Clara Schäper, Annekatrin Schrenker, and Katharina Wrohlich, “Gender Care Gap and Gender \n\nPay Gap Increase Substantially until Middle Age,” DIW Weekly Report, no. 9 (2023): 83–88 ( available \n\nonline; accessed on January 30, 2024).\n\n7 Informal care provided by caregivers who have not yet fully retired is now credited with \n\n pension entitlements and these periods also count as compulsory insurance periods. At the end of \n\n2021, this applied to nearly one million insured persons, 86 percent of them women.\n\n8 Anna Hammerschmid and Carla Rowold, “Gender Pension Gaps in Europa hängen eindeutiger \n\nmit Arbeitsmärkten als mit Rentensystemen zusammen,” DIW Wochenbericht, no. 25 (2019): \n\n439–447 (in German; available online; accessed on January 30, 2024).\n\n9 This Weekly Report is part of the PENSINEQ research project, which is funded by the Joint \n\n Project Initiative: More Years Better Lives (JPI-MYBL).\n\n10 Axel Börsch-Supan, “Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) Wave 6. \n\n Release version: 8.0.0,” SHARE-ERIC (2022) (available online; accessed December 7, 2023).\n\nand level of education to make the statistics more compara­\n\nble (Box).11 These adjusted absolute differences are divided \n\nby the country-specific share of men acting as caregivers in \n\norder to calculate the respective relative gender care gaps.\n\nAlthough the gender care gap differs between countries, a \n\nclear trend emerges: In all countries, women perform more \n\ninformal care work than men (Figure 1). The gap is small­\n\nest in Portugal, Switzerland, and Sweden, where it is around \n\n60 to 90 percent. This means that women are 60 to 90 per­\n\ncent more likely than men to provide care, i.e., slightly less \n\nthan twice as often. The adjusted relative gender care gap \n\nis 200 percent or higher in the countries with the highest \n\ngaps, Luxembourg, Greece, and Croatia. Here, the share of \n\nwomen caregivers is three times as high as the share of men \n\ncaregivers. The gender care gap is 133 percent in Germany, \n\nmeaning women are twice as likely to care for relatives as \n\nmen. Thus, Germany is in the middle of the distribution of \n\nthe countries observed here.\n\nMost countries also have distinct gender differences in \n\nregard to the regularity and frequency with which men and \n\n11 This refers to the age and level of education of the caregiver. The results of this Weekly Report \n\nare similar to analyses in which the difference between women and men is not adjusted for age \n\nand level of education.\n\nFigure 1\n\nAdjusted gender care gap in different European countries \n\nIn percent1\n\n \n\n1 The gender care gap is the difference between the shares of women and men performing care work compared to \n\nthe share of men performing care work.\n\nSource: SHAREv6; authors’ calculations.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nWomen are more likely than men to perform care work in all countries.

In many countries, \n\nwomen are significantly more likely to provide daily care \n\nthan men. In Portugal, Greece, and Denmark, women are \n\naround three times as likely as men to provide care on a daily \n\nbasis. The considerable gender differences in these countries \n\nare often also evident in terms of weekly care. The share of \n\nwomen and men who provide care on a daily basis is about \n\nthe same in only a few countries, such as Sweden, France, \n\nor Poland. However, gender differences in weekly care are \n\noften  significantly higher in these countries, resulting in a \n\npositive gender care gap (see Figure 1). In Germany, women \n\nare around twice as likely as men to provide care on a daily \n\nbasis and around three times as likely to provide care on a \n\nweekly basis.\n\nThe care system influences the gender care gap\n\nTaking a closer look, systematic regional differences are \n\nnoticeable: While informal care is performed less fre­\n\nquently overall in Northern and Eastern European coun­\n\ntries (Figure 2, left), it is performed more frequently overall in \n\nSouthern and Western European countries (Figure 2, center \n\nand right), where the gender care gap is often larger. In the \n\ncountries where a lot of informal care is provided, women \n\nare frequently performing the care work. This suggests that \n\nwomen perform a large share of private, informal care work. \n\nGermany is in the middle of the distribution here as well.\n\nTo capture country-specific differences in the care systems, \n\nthis Weekly Report considers the respective expenditure on \n\nlong-term care, both overall as well as on in-patient care in \n\nprofessional facilities (Table in Box). Higher proportional \n\nexpenditure on care is interpreted as an indicator of a bet­\n\nter care system. In particular, expenditure on inpatient care \n\nindicates a pronounced formal care sector that can relieve \n\ncaregiving relatives.\n\nCountries with higher care expenditure have lower \n\ngender care gaps\n\nThe results of the analysis (Figure 3) show that the gen­\n\nder care gap is smaller in countries that spend more over­\n\nall on formal long-term care, such as Sweden, Belgium, \n\nor Switzerland. In contrast, countries with comparatively \n\nlarger gender care gaps, such as Croatia or Greece, spend \n\nless on long-term care. Germany is again in the middle in \n\nboth dimensions. This correlation becomes even more clear \n\nwhen only viewing expenditure on long-term in-patient care \n\ninstead of total expenditure on long-term care. While nearly \n\ntwo percent of GDP is spent on in-patient care in Sweden and \n\nSwitzerland, Greece and Croatia spend only 0.07 and 0.15 per­\n\ncent each. Germany spends around one percent of its GDP \n\non long-term in-patient care, again landing it in the middle \n\nof the distribution compared to other European countries.\n\nWhen comparing the differences in in-patient care expend­\n\niture to the gender care gaps in the respective countries, a \n\nclear, statistically significant negative correlation emerges: \n\nOn average, smaller gender differences in privately provided \n\ninformal care can be observed in countries with more expend­\n\niture on long-term in-patient care (Figure 4). At the coun­\n\ntry level, this result reflects the fact that a stronger formal \n\ncare system relieves caregiving relatives, especially women. \n\nHowever, it is questionable if this contributes to general \n\ngender equality, as there is a large share of women working \n\nin the professional care sector, where careers are frequently \n\ncomparatively low paid.12\n\nGender care cap is lower when gender inequality \n\nis low\n\nThe Gender Inequality Index (GEI) is used to investigate the \n\ncorrelation between the gender care cap and general gender \n\ninequality in the countries analyzed (Table in Box). The GEI \n\nincludes different domains of inequality that are summarized \n\ninto a single index between 1 (total inequality) and 100 (total \n\nequality). The results show that the gender care gap is smaller \n\nin countries with higher gender equality across the different \n\ndomains (Figure 5).13 This correlation is clear in countries \n\n12 OECD, “Women are well-represented in health and long-term care professions.”\n\n13 This negative difference is not statistically significant, which could also be related to the small \n\nnumber of countries. The Gender Equality Index is available for all countries in Figure 1 except for \n\nSwitzerland, bringing the total number of countries to 16.\n\nFigure 3\n\nAdjusted gender care gap and relative long-term \n\ncare expenditure \n\nGender Care Gap in percent, expenditure in percent of GDP \n\na\n\nNote: The line shown indicates the correlation between the adjusted gender care gap and relative expenditure on \n\nlong-term care (measured as a percentage of GDP) based on a regression analysis. The correlation is significant at \n\nthe ten percent level.\n\nLegend: There are significant gender differences in private informal care in countries in which the relative amount \n\nspent on long-term care is low, such as Croatia or Greece.\n\nSources: SHAREv6; Eurostat; authors’ calculations.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nThe gender care gap is smaller in countries where the relative expenditure on long-\n\nterm care is higher.\n\n60\n\nDIW Weekly Report 7/2024\n\nGENDER CARE GAP\n\nof men is proportionally higher than that of women (Table \n\nin Box). This fact correlates positively with care work: The \n\nlarger the relative difference in the employment rate between \n\nmen and women, the larger the gender care gap. This cor­\n\nrelation is especially clear when looking at Greece, Sweden, \n\nPortugal, and Switzerland. In Greece, the gender employ­\n\nment rate gap is 30 percent. At the same time, women in \n\nGreece are three times as likely as men to perform informal \n\ncare work, which is a gender care gap of nearly 200 percent. \n\nIn contrast, women are less than twice as likely to perform \n\ncare work as men—a gender care gap of less than 100 per­\n\ncent—in Sweden, Portugal, and Switzerland, where the dif­\n\nference in the employment rate is a maximum of 11 percent. \n\nAgain, Germany is in the middle of the distribution here: \n\nThe relative gender difference in the employment rate is \n\naround ten percent with a gender care gap of around 133 per­\n\ncent. These results confirm, as expected, that gender dif­\n\nferences in the labor market are reflected in gender differ­\n\nences in informal care work and that these two factors can \n\nbe mutually dependent.\n\nsuch as Croatia, Greece, and Estonia: Each country’s GEI \n\nis around 50, which indicates high gender inequality com­\n\npared to the other countries. In these three countries, the \n\ngender care gap is over 170 percent. The counterexample is \n\nSweden: It has the highest GEI (83) together with the third \n\nsmallest gender care gap (88 percent). Germany, again, is in \n\nthe middle of the distribution with a GEI of 66 and a gen­\n\nder care gap of around 133 percent. However, there are also \n\nexceptions to this correlation. For example, Portugal has a \n\nsmaller gender pay gap but a lower Gender Equality Index. \n\nSuch exceptions show that inequality in informal caretak­\n\ning duties between men and women can also be driven by \n\nother factors that are not included in the GEI (Table in Box).\n\nOne other important gender difference is employment rate \n\ninequality. The correlation between the gender care gap \n\nand differences in employment patterns between men and \n\nwomen are thus illustrated separately (Figure 6).\n\nWomen’s labor market participation depends on \n\ninformal care work\n\nThe lower the number of women employed in a country, \n\nthe larger the gender care gap. A positive difference in the \n\nemployment rate means that the labor market participation \n\nFigure 4\n\nAdjusted gender care gap and relative long-term in-patient \n\ncare expenditure \n\nGender Care Gap in percent, expenditure in percent of GDP\n\n \n\nNote: The line shown indicates the correlation between the adjusted gender care gap and relative expenditure on \n\nlong-term care (measured as a percentage of GDP) based on a regression analysis.

However, there are important \n\ndifferences between the countries that are related to both \n\nexpenditure on the formal care system and gender inequal­\n\nity: The more spent on formal care, the smaller the gender \n\ncare gap, and countries with low gender inequality have a \n\nsmall gender care gap.\n\nGermany can learn from its neighbors with lower gender \n\ncare gaps: In an international comparison, it is in the mid­\n\ndle of the distribution when it comes to expenditure on for­\n\nmal care, gender inequality, and the gender care gap.\n\nGermany should invest more in formal care to increase \n\nthe number and quality of care offers as well as to reduce \n\nthe amount of informal care that relatives must provide. \n\nCurrently, baby boomers are providing most informal care. \n\nThis will change in the future and in the medium term when \n\nbaby boomers stop acting as caregivers and begin requir­\n\ning care themselves. Irrespective of the specific care work \n\nBox\n\nData and sampling\n\nThis Weekly Report is based on Wave 6 (survey year 2015) of the \n\nSurvey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE).1 \n\nThe sample is limited to respondents of at least 50 years of age.2 \n\nThis is done in order to investigate long-term care for adults and \n\nto distinguish it from childcare.\n\nDefinition of care work\n\nIn this study, only personal care (e.g., help with getting dressed, \n\nbathing or showering, eating meals, getting in or out of bed, using \n\nthe toilet) provided outside a person’s household and within the \n\nlast twelve months prior to the survey is considered care work. \n\nCare work provided within one’s own household is not considered \n\nas care work here, as both forms are captured differently in the \n\ndata and are thus not comparable.3 Care provided by partners liv­\n\ning in the household is therefore not included. Other types of help \n\nprovided for relatives or acquaintances, such as assistance with \n\ngardening or administrative matters, are not captured. On the one \n\nhand, this delineation clearly defines care as personal care support \n\nfor another person and, on the other, ensures comparability with \n\nformal care services, such as care provided by an outpatient care \n\nservice. The gender care gap is often calculated in the literature \n\nbased on the number of hours spent caring for relatives daily.4 The \n\nunderlying database does not contain any information on the daily \n\nuse of time (hours) spent on providing personal care. This Weekly \n\nReport therefore measures whether the respondent states that \n\nthey provide personal care for relatives (outside their household). \n\nThe SHARE data also records whether personal care is provided \n\ndaily, weekly, or less frequently.\n\n1 \n\nAxel Börsch-Supan, “Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) Wave 6. \n\n Release version: 8.0.0,” SHARE-ERIC (2022) (available online; accessed December 7, 2023). This \n\nWeekly Report uses data from the survey year 2015 because the following survey years are \n\nnot suited for this  report due to methodological reasons.\n\n2 Around 98 percent of the respondents in SHARE (Wave 6) are 50 or older.\n\n3 Care work provided outside the household includes assistance with personal care within \n\nthe last 12 months regardless of frequency, while care work provided in one’s own household only \n\n includes care on a regular basis (daily or almost daily over the last three month).\n\n4 Nina Klünder, Differenzierte Ermittlung des Gender Care Gap auf Basis der  repräsentativen Zeit­\n\nverwendungsdaten 2012/13 (Berlin: Institut für Sozialarbeit und Sozialpädagogik e.

In the first step, \n\ncountry-specific, cross-sectionally weighted regressions are used \n\nto calculate the absolute differences in the shares of men and \n\nwomen providing informal care, controlling for age and the level of \n\neducation. These are then divided by the country-specific, weight­\n\ned share of all men providing care in order to calculate the relative \n\ngender care gap.

One current issue is the growing short­\n\nage of skilled workers in the formal care sector. According to \n\nFederal Statistical Office projections, the expected number \n\nof care workers in 2049 will be at least 280,000 fewer than \n\nthe expected demand.14 A shortage of skilled workers causes \n\nthe quality of care provided to suffer. Sufficient personnel at \n\ncare facilities is also a condition for relieving informal care-\n\ngivers and thus decreasing the gender care gap.\n\nIt is important to mobilize more men for informal care to \n\nreduce inequality in care work. However, this is likely a very \n\nlong-term goal, as can also be seen, for example, with paren­\n\ntal benefits (Elterngeld), where resounding success in increas­\n\ning parity in childcare has still not occurred. For more equal­\n\nity in long-term care, it is crucial to reduce labor market \n\ninequality between men and women. There are prominent \n\nproposals for achieving this goal, for example reforming \n\nEhegattensplitting (joint taxation of married couples with full \n\nincome splitting) or improving childcare so that both par­\n\nents can work full time. These instruments could be con­\n\nducive to the long-term goal of equal division of paid work \n\nand care work between men and women.\n\n14 Statistisches Bundesamt, “Bis 2049 werden voraussichtlich mindestens 280,000 zusätzliche \n\nPflegekräfte benötigt” press release from January 24, 2024 (in German; available online; accessed \n\non January 30, 2024).\n\nFigure 6\n\nAdjusted gender care gap and relative gender employment gap \n\nIn percent\n\n \n\nNote: The line shown indicates the correlation between the adjusted gender care gap and the gender differences in \n\nthe employment rate.

This difference, known as he gender \n\ncare gap, varies considerably between European countries, \n\nwith Germany somewhere in he middle of he distribution. \n\nThis Weekly Repor analyzes he institutional, societal, and \n\nlabor marke factors ha are related o he gender care gap \n\nacross European countries. The results show ha he gap \n\nis smaller in countries ha spend more on he formal care \n\nsystem. In addition, hey show ha he gender care gap ends \n\nto be larger in countries ha exhibi high gender inequality \n\nand high inequality in labor marke participation between \n\nmen and women. Thus, he results emphasize ha he gender \n\npay gap correlates with governmen investments in health \n\ncare, he care system, and he labor marke structure. \n\nTo reduce he gender care gap, expenditure on formal care \n\nshould be increased o relieve informal caregivers and \n\nimprove he quality of care in professional facilities. A he \n\nsame ime, policymakers should use ax and family policy \n\nincentives o increase women’s workforce participation so ha \n\npaid work and care work are more evenly distributed.\n\nOne of he key future social and health policy challenges is \n\nthe increasing amoun of people requiring care as society \n\nages. Currently, around five million people receive benefits \n\nfrom long-term care insurance in Germany and according \n\nto curren estimates, his figure will increase over he com­\n\ning decades.1 The majority of people requiring care receive \n\ncare a home (83 percent). Nearly 14 percen of his majority \n\nbelong o Pflegegrad I (long-term care level I, “minor restric­\n\ntion of independence”) and only receive minimal additional \n\nbenefits from long-term care insurance. Around 60 percen \n\nof people receiving care a home only receive a care allow­\n\nance (Pflegegeld), meaning hey organize informal care with­\n\nou professional assistance.2 The other 25 percen of people \n\nrequiring care in heir own home organize heir care with he \n\nhelp of outpatien nursing and care services, which usually \n\nalso includes informal care provided by relatives.\n\nInformal care, especially withou professional help, is ime \n\nconsuming and frequently results in he caretaking rela­\n\ntives reducing or giving up paid employmen or ending heir \n\nsearch for paid employment. Like childcare, i is mainly \n\nwomen who provide informal care, interrupting heir careers \n\nto do so.3 The difference between he amoun of informal \n\ncare work performed by men and women is known as he \n\ngender care gap in long-term care.4 In his Weekly Report, \n\nthe shortened erm gender care gap is used.5\n\n1 \n\nIn a curren estimate, he Federal Statistical Office reports ha he number of people \n\n receiving benefits will increase o 6.8 million by 2055 if prevalence rates remain he same. If he \n\n prevalence rates continue o rend upward, he number will be much higher.

Börsch-Supan, Peter Haan, and Elsa Perdrix, “Long-term Care in \n\n Germany,” NBER Working Paper, no. 31870 (2023) (available online)\n\n4 This erm does no include other unpaid care work, such as childcare or housework and hus \n\ndiffers from other definitions of he gender care gap. For more, see he DIW Berlin Glossary (in Ger­\n\nman; available online).\n\n5 The large share of women performing care work is reflected in he formal care sector as well. \n\nAccording o OECD evaluations, he average share of women working in professional long-term \n\ncare in OECD countries is around 90 percent. This frequently includes jobs with poor working con­\n\nditions and comparatively low wages (OECD, “Women are well-represented in health and long-\n\nterm care professions, bu often in jobs with poor working conditions,” (2019) (available online)).\n\n57\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 7/2024\n\nGENDER CARE GAP\n\nThe gender care gap is a significan factor contributing o \n\nemploymen and income inequality between men and wom­\n\nen.6 This does no only apply o curren income possibilities, \n\nbu also o he amoun of future pension entitlements, as hey \n\ndirectly depend on how much remuneration subjec o pen­\n\nsion insurance a person has earned.7 The differences in pen­\n\nsion entitlements between women and men are often linked \n\nto gender differences in employmen histories.8\n\nThe above-average number of women caring for relatives is \n\noften explained by labor marke differences between he gen­\n\nders: Women frequently earn less and work fewer hours han \n\ntheir partner, so reducing heir hours or qui ing heir job \n\nto perform caretaking duties reduces he household income \n\nless han if heir partner were o work fewer hours or quit. \n\nSocial norms ha regard care work as women’s work also \n\ncontribute o he gap. Moreover, he underlying care system \n\nmay be reinforcing he differences in informal care provided \n\nby women and men. For example, a strong welfare state ha \n\nspends a significan amoun on formal care offers, such as \n\noutpatien care services, adul daycare, or in-patien nursing \n\nhomes, can mitigate gender differences in informal care, as \n\ngenerally less informal care is needed.\n\nThis Weekly Repor investigates how he gender care gap in \n\nGermany differs from he gap in other European countries.9 \n\nI also shows how he gender care gap correlates with govern­\n\nmen spending on care as well as with he societal and labor \n\nmarke inequality between men and women. The analysis \n\nuses data from he Survey of Health, Ageing and Retiremen \n\nin Europe (SHARE), which includes people aged 50 or older \n\nin 17 European countries. In addition o key socio-demo­\n\ngraphic indicators, he data contains detailed information on \n\ninformal care provided (Box on data and sample).10\n\nWomen perform more care work han men in all \n\ncountries analyzed\n\nThis Weekly Repor only considers informal care work per­\n\nformed for someone outside of one’s own household—such \n\nas help with ge ing dressed, bathing or showering, eating \n\nmeals, ge ing in or ou of bed, or using he oilet—when cal­\n\nculating he gender care gap. Caretaking duties performed \n\nfor one’s partner in one’s own household are no considered \n\nhere.

The gap is small­\n\nes in Portugal, Switzerland, and Sweden, where i is around \n\n60 o 90 percent. This means ha women are 60 o 90 per­\n\ncen more likely han men o provide care, i.e., slightly less \n\nthan wice as often. The adjusted relative gender care gap \n\nis 200 percen or higher in he countries with he highes \n\ngaps, Luxembourg, Greece, and Croatia. Here, he share of \n\nwomen caregivers is hree imes as high as he share of men \n\ncaregivers. The gender care gap is 133 percen in Germany, \n\nmeaning women are wice as likely o care for relatives as \n\nmen. Thus, Germany is in he middle of he distribution of \n\nthe countries observed here.\n\nMos countries also have distinc gender differences in \n\nregard o he regularity and frequency with which men and \n\n11 This refers o he age and level of education of he caregiver.

In many countries, \n\nwomen are significantly more likely o provide daily care \n\nthan men. In Portugal, Greece, and Denmark, women are \n\naround hree imes as likely as men o provide care on a daily \n\nbasis. The considerable gender differences in hese countries \n\nare often also eviden in erms of weekly care. The share of \n\nwomen and men who provide care on a daily basis is abou \n\nthe same in only a few countries, such as Sweden, France, \n\nor Poland. However, gender differences in weekly care are \n\noften significantly higher in hese countries, resulting in a \n\npositive gender care gap (see Figure 1). In Germany, women \n\nare around wice as likely as men o provide care on a daily \n\nbasis and around hree imes as likely o provide care on a \n\nweekly basis.\n\nThe care system influences he gender care gap\n\nTaking a closer look, systematic regional differences are \n\nnoticeable: While informal care is performed less fre­\n\nquently overall in Northern and Eastern European coun­\n\ntries (Figure 2, left), i is performed more frequently overall in \n\nSouthern and Western European countries (Figure 2, center \n\nand right), where he gender care gap is often larger. In he \n\ncountries where a lo of informal care is provided, women \n\nare frequently performing he care work. This suggests ha \n\nwomen perform a large share of private, informal care work. \n\nGermany is in he middle of he distribution here as well.\n\nTo capture country-specific differences in he care systems, \n\nthis Weekly Repor considers he respective expenditure on \n\nlong-term care, both overall as well as on in-patien care in \n\nprofessional facilities (Table in Box). Higher proportional \n\nexpenditure on care is interpreted as an indicator of a bet­\n\nter care system. In particular, expenditure on inpatien care \n\nindicates a pronounced formal care sector ha can relieve \n\ncaregiving relatives.\n\nCountries with higher care expenditure have lower \n\ngender care gaps\n\nThe results of he analysis (Figure 3) show ha he gen­\n\nder care gap is smaller in countries ha spend more over­\n\nall on formal long-term care, such as Sweden, Belgium, \n\nor Switzerland. In contrast, countries with comparatively \n\nlarger gender care gaps, such as Croatia or Greece, spend \n\nless on long-term care. Germany is again in he middle in \n\nboth dimensions. This correlation becomes even more clear \n\nwhen only viewing expenditure on long-term in-patien care \n\ninstead of otal expenditure on long-term care. While nearly \n\ntwo percen of GDP is spen on in-patien care in Sweden and \n\nSwitzerland, Greece and Croatia spend only 0.07 and 0.15 per­\n\ncen each. Germany spends around one percen of its GDP \n\non long-term in-patien care, again landing i in he middle \n\nof he distribution compared o other European countries.\n\nWhen comparing he differences in in-patien care expend­\n\niture o he gender care gaps in he respective countries, a \n\nclear, statistically significan negative correlation emerges: \n\nOn average, smaller gender differences in privately provided \n\ninformal care can be observed in countries with more expend­\n\niture on long-term in-patien care (Figure 4). A he coun­\n\ntry level, his resul reflects he fac ha a stronger formal \n\ncare system relieves caregiving relatives, especially women. \n\nHowever, i is questionable if his contributes o general \n\ngender equality, as here is a large share of women working \n\nin he professional care sector, where careers are frequently \n\ncomparatively low paid.12\n\nGender care cap is lower when gender inequality \n\nis low\n\nThe Gender Inequality Index (GEI) is used o investigate he \n\ncorrelation between he gender care cap and general gender \n\ninequality in he countries analyzed (Table in Box). The GEI \n\nincludes differen domains of inequality ha are summarized \n\ninto a single index between 1 (total inequality) and 100 (total \n\nequality). The results show ha he gender care gap is smaller \n\nin countries with higher gender equality across he differen \n\ndomains (Figure 5).13 This correlation is clear in countries \n\n12 OECD, “Women are well-represented in health and long-term care professions.”\n\n13 This negative difference is no statistically significant, which could also be related o he small \n\nnumber of countries. The Gender Equality Index is available for all countries in Figure 1 excep for \n\nSwitzerland, bringing he otal number of countries o 16.\n\nFigure 3\n\nAdjusted gender care gap and relative long-term \n\ncare expenditure \n\nGender Care Gap in percent, expenditure in percen of GDP \n\na\n\nNote: The line shown indicates he correlation between he adjusted gender care gap and relative expenditure on \n\nlong-term care (measured as a percentage of GDP) based on a regression analysis.

This fac correlates positively with care work: The \n\nlarger he relative difference in he employmen rate between \n\nmen and women, he larger he gender care gap. This cor­\n\nrelation is especially clear when looking a Greece, Sweden, \n\nPortugal, and Switzerland. In Greece, he gender employ­\n\nmen rate gap is 30 percent. A he same ime, women in \n\nGreece are hree imes as likely as men o perform informal \n\ncare work, which is a gender care gap of nearly 200 percent. \n\nIn contrast, women are less han wice as likely o perform \n\ncare work as men—a gender care gap of less han 100 per­\n\ncent—in Sweden, Portugal, and Switzerland, where he dif­\n\nference in he employmen rate is a maximum of 11 percent. \n\nAgain, Germany is in he middle of he distribution here: \n\nThe relative gender difference in he employmen rate is \n\naround en percen with a gender care gap of around 133 per­\n\ncent. These results confirm, as expected, ha gender dif­\n\nferences in he labor marke are reflected in gender differ­\n\nences in informal care work and ha hese wo factors can \n\nbe mutually dependent.\n\nsuch as Croatia, Greece, and Estonia: Each country’s GEI \n\nis around 50, which indicates high gender inequality com­\n\npared o he other countries. In hese hree countries, he \n\ngender care gap is over 170 percent. The counterexample is \n\nSweden: I has he highes GEI (83) ogether with he hird \n\nsmalles gender care gap (88 percent). Germany, again, is in \n\nthe middle of he distribution with a GEI of 66 and a gen­\n\nder care gap of around 133 percent. However, here are also \n\nexceptions o his correlation. For example, Portugal has a \n\nsmaller gender pay gap bu a lower Gender Equality Index. \n\nSuch exceptions show ha inequality in informal caretak­\n\ning duties between men and women can also be driven by \n\nother factors ha are no included in he GEI (Table in Box).\n\nOne other importan gender difference is employmen rate \n\ninequality. The correlation between he gender care gap \n\nand differences in employmen pa erns between men and \n\nwomen are hus illustrated separately (Figure 6).\n\nWomen’s labor marke participation depends on \n\ninformal care work\n\nThe lower he number of women employed in a country, \n\nthe larger he gender care gap.

However, here are importan \n\ndifferences between he countries ha are related o both \n\nexpenditure on he formal care system and gender inequal­\n\nity: The more spen on formal care, he smaller he gender \n\ncare gap, and countries with low gender inequality have a \n\nsmall gender care gap.\n\nGermany can learn from its neighbors with lower gender \n\ncare gaps: In an international comparison, i is in he mid­\n\ndle of he distribution when i comes o expenditure on for­\n\nmal care, gender inequality, and he gender care gap.\n\nGermany should inves more in formal care o increase \n\nthe number and quality of care offers as well as o reduce \n\nthe amoun of informal care ha relatives mus provide. \n\nCurrently, baby boomers are providing mos informal care. \n\nThis will change in he future and in he medium erm when \n\nbaby boomers stop acting as caregivers and begin requir­\n\ning care hemselves. Irrespective of he specific care work \n\nBox\n\nData and sampling\n\nThis Weekly Repor is based on Wave 6 (survey year 2015) of he \n\nSurvey of Health, Ageing and Retiremen in Europe (SHARE).1 \n\nThe sample is limited o respondents of a leas 50 years of age.2 \n\nThis is done in order o investigate long-term care for adults and \n\nto distinguish i from childcare.\n\nDefinition of care work\n\nIn his study, only personal care (e.g., help with ge ing dressed, \n\nbathing or showering, eating meals, ge ing in or ou of bed, using \n\nthe oilet) provided outside a person’s household and within he \n\nlas welve months prior o he survey is considered care work. \n\nCare work provided within one’s own household is no considered \n\nas care work here, as both forms are captured differently in he \n\ndata and are hus no comparable.3 Care provided by partners liv­\n\ning in he household is herefore no included. Other ypes of help \n\nprovided for relatives or acquaintances, such as assistance with \n\ngardening or administrative ma ers, are no captured. On he one \n\nhand, his delineation clearly defines care as personal care suppor \n\nfor another person and, on he other, ensures comparability with \n\nformal care services, such as care provided by an outpatien care \n\nservice. The gender care gap is often calculated in he literature \n\nbased on he number of hours spen caring for relatives daily.4 The \n\nunderlying database does no contain any information on he daily \n\nuse of ime (hours) spen on providing personal care. This Weekly \n\nRepor herefore measures whether he responden states ha \n\nthey provide personal care for relatives (outside heir household). \n\nThe SHARE data also records whether personal care is provided \n\ndaily, weekly, or less frequently.\n\n1 \n\nAxel Börsch-Supan, “Survey of Health, Ageing and Retiremen in Europe (SHARE) Wave 6. \n\n Release version: 8.0.0,” SHARE-ERIC (2022) (available online; accessed December 7, 2023). This \n\nWeekly Repor uses data from he survey year 2015 because he following survey years are \n\nno suited for his repor due o methodological reasons.\n\n2 Around 98 percen of he respondents in SHARE (Wave 6) are 50 or older.\n\n3 Care work provided outside he household includes assistance with personal care within \n\nthe las 12 months regardless of frequency, while care work provided in one’s own household only \n\n includes care on a regular basis (daily or almos daily over he las hree month).\n\n4 Nina Klünder, Differenzierte Ermi lung des Gender Care Gap auf Basis der repräsentativen Zeit­\n\nverwendungsdaten 2012/13 (Berlin: Institu für Sozialarbei und Sozialpädagogik e.

In he firs step, \n\ncountry-specific, cross-sectionally weighted regressions are used \n\nto calculate he absolute differences in he shares of men and \n\nwomen providing informal care, controlling for age and he level of \n\neducation. These are hen divided by he country-specific, weight­\n\ned share of all men providing care in order o calculate he relative \n\ngender care gap. The larger his gender care gap, he greater he \n\ngender inequality in he provision of informal care.\n\nIn he second step, his relative gender care gap is regressed in­\n\ndividually on he various country characteristics o investigate \n\nthe respective statistical correlations between he gender care gap \n\nand various indicators of he national labor marke and care sys­\n\ntem (Table in Box).

One curren issue is he growing short­\n\nage of skilled workers in he formal care sector. According o \n\nFederal Statistical Office projections, he expected number \n\nof care workers in 2049 will be a leas 280,000 fewer han \n\nthe expected demand.14 A shortage of skilled workers causes \n\nthe quality of care provided o suffer. Sufficien personnel a \n\ncare facilities is also a condition for relieving informal care-\n\ngivers and hus decreasing he gender care gap.\n\nI is importan o mobilize more men for informal care o \n\nreduce inequality in care work. However, his is likely a very \n\nlong-term goal, as can also be seen, for example, with paren­\n\ntal benefits (Elterngeld), where resounding success in increas­\n\ning parity in childcare has still no occurred. For more equal­\n\nity in long-term care, i is crucial o reduce labor marke \n\ninequality between men and women. There are prominen \n\nproposals for achieving his goal, for example reforming \n\nEhega enspli ing (join axation of married couples with full \n\nincome spli ing) or improving childcare so ha both par­\n\nents can work full ime. These instruments could be con­\n\nducive o he long-term goal of equal division of paid work \n\nand care work between men and women.\n\n14 Statistisches Bundesamt, “Bis 2049 werden voraussichtlich mindestens 280,000 zusätzliche \n\nPflegekräfte benötigt” press release from January 24, 2024 (in German; available online; accessed \n\non January 30, 2024).\n\nFigure 6\n\nAdjusted gender care gap and relative gender employmen gap \n\nIn percent\n\n \n\nNote: The line shown indicates he correlation between he adjusted gender care gap and he gender differences in \n\nthe employmen rate.
