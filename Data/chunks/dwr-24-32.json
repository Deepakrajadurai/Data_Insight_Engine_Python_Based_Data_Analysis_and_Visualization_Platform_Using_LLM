    "Income, work, and health satisfaction differ primarily by household income, age, and parental status By Laura Buchinger, Theresa Entringer, and Daniel Graeber ABSTRACT Subjective well-being is essential for both quality of life and a healthy society. Studies have shown ha satisfied people have be er relationships, are more productive, and have a longer life expectancy. General life satisfaction is being discussed as an alternative measure of prosperity beyond GDP. Thus, find­ ings on his opic are relevan for both he scientific commu­ nity as well as policymakers. This Weekly Repor investigates the income, work, and health satisfaction of he German popu­ lation from 2004 o 2021. Using data from he Socio-Economic Panel, we investigate if here are differences in satisfaction between genders, regions (east/west), age groups, parental status, and income groups. The analysis shows ha general life satisfaction as well as income, work, and health satisfac­ tion have either increased or remained constan since 2004. However, differences between groups, some quite significant, still remain, especially in erms of health satisfaction. Com­ paratively, low-income earners and parents are dissatisfied. To counter his, policy measures o unburden parents and improve he childcare system are needed. Subjective well-being has a significan impac on he quality of life in a society. Psychological and medical studies have shown ha people who are more satisfied have be er rela­ tionships,1 are more productive a work,2 and even have a longer life expectancy.3 Subjective well-being is also a opic of research in economics.4 The discussion around subjective well-being as a measure of human progress is being revived as he suitability of GDP as a measure of human progress is being questioned due o climate change and increasingly scare resources.5 Findings on he subjective well-being of he German population are hus extremely relevan for both sci­ ence and policymakers. The literature differentiates between affective well-being— the frequency with which people experience positive and neg­ ative feelings—and cognitive well-being, how people eval­ uate heir life overall compared o heir ideal vision of it.6 Studies capture cognitive well-being by estimating general life satisfaction as well as satisfaction in individual domains. While he majority of he literature focuses on general life satisfaction, here are relatively few studies on satisfaction with differen life domains. This Weekly Repor contributes to he literature by analyzing inequalities in satisfaction in three differen domains: personal income, work, and health. Work is a key par of life for mos adults, and work satisfac­ tion hus plays an importan role in he well-being of mos adults in Germany. The same applies o satisfaction with personal income; income enables social participation and 1 Shannon More and Ed Diener, “Types of subjective well-being and heir associations with rela­ tionship outcomes,” Journal of Positive Psychology and Wellbeing 3, no. 2 (2019): 112–118. 2 Jesús F.

As health is he basis for all aspects of life, health satisfaction is a key indi­ cator for participation in all parts of life. For he analysis, we use data from he Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), one of he few datasets in Germany ha contains representative data on general life satisfaction as well as on satisfaction with differen life domains (Box).7 The analy­ sis period is from 2004 o 2021, as income satisfaction has been included in he SOEP since 2004.8 Differences between women and men, eas and wes Germany, people with and withou children, people below and above 30, and people with low, middle, and high ne household incomes are ana­ lyzed descriptively in his period.9 These indicators have already shown meaningful differences in other analyses.10 The respondents rated heir satisfaction with differen life domains on a scale from 0 (no a all satisfied) o 10 (com­ pletely satisfied). The findings of his analysis can inform policymakers in which life domains and for which popu­ lation groups measures o increase well-being are particu­ larly relevant. 7 Jan Goebel e al., “The German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP),” Journal of Economics and Sta­ tistics 239, no. 2 (2010): 345–360. 8 This analysis uses data ha covers up o 2021. 9 We differentiate between differen income erciles. 10 Theresa M. Entringer and Laura Buchinger, Subjektives Wohlbefinden und Sorgen. Datenre­ por 2024 – Ein Sozialberich für die Bundesrepublik Deutschland (Federal Statistical Office (Desta­ tis), Berlin Social Science Center (WZB), Federal Institute for Population Research (BiB) ogether with he Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) a he German Institute for Economic Research (DIW Berlin), 2024). Major differences between general life satisfaction and satisfaction with differen domains Depending on he domain, he level of satisfaction and its developmen over he pas years differ greatly (Figure 1). In 2004, for example, general life satisfaction was rated he high­ es with an average of 6.7 points, while personal income sat­ isfaction was lowes with an average of 5.5 points. By 2021, both values had improved, with satisfaction with personal income (6.9) rising less steadily bu more strongly han gen­ eral life satisfaction (7.4). In comparison, he increase in real wages during a similar period, 2004 o 2019, was around en percent.11 Similarly, although no quite as steeply, work sat­ isfaction increased from 6.8 o 7.2. In contrast, health satis­ faction has remained constan",
    "over he years a around 6.5. Its only increase, o 6.9, occurred during he coronavirus pandemic in 2021. Women and eas Germans have caugh up in terms of income satisfaction There are considerable gender differences when i comes to personal income satisfaction: Compared o women, men have been consistently more satisfied with heir income over the years (Figure 2).12 In 2004, men were around 0.4 points 11 Guido Zinke, Lohnentwicklung in Deutschland und Europa (2020: Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung) (in German; available online). 12 This refers o labor income only. As a result, only employed people are considered in his anal­ ysis. Figure 1 General life, income, work, and health satisfaction Scale from 0 (no a all satisfied) o 10 (completely satisfied) Source: Authors’ calculations based on SOEP data. © DIW Berlin 2024 Income, work, and health satisfaction have either increased or remained constan since 2004. Box Dataset: The Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) The Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) is a representative and multidisciplinary household survey. Households and heir members in Germany have been surveyed on heir general life situation on an annual basis since 1984.1 These surveys cover education, he labor marke situation, and health of he respondents. As of 2024, around 30,000 respondents from around 15,000 households are surveyed annually. Data on general life satisfaction and on personal income, work, and health satisfaction of he SOEP respondents were used for he analysis. Specifically, he respondents were asked: “How satis­ fied are you currently with [life domain]?” The respondents in­ dicated heir satisfaction on a scale of 0 (no a all satisfied) o 10 (completely satisfied). The question abou work satisfaction was only posed o people who are working. The question abou health satisfaction was posed o all people living in Germany. To be able o make be er comparisons over ime, refugees are no included in he analysis. 1 Jan Goebel e al., “The German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP),” Journal of Economics and Statistics 239, no. 2 (2019): 345–360. 214 DIW Weekly Repor 32+33+34/2024 SATISFACTION Figure 2 Income satisfaction Scale from 0 (no a all satisfied) o 10 (completely satisfied) Source: Authors’ calculations based on SOEP data. © DIW Berlin 2024 Over he years, men have been consistently more satisfied with heir personal income han women. 215 DIW Weekly Repor 32+33+34/2024 SATISFACTION more satisfied with heir personal income han women. In 2007, heir satisfaction increased o 0.6 points. After his, how­ ever, women’s satisfaction began o catch up and men were only 0.2 points more satisfied han women by 2021. While personal income satisfaction has increased over ime for both men and women, he increase was much greater for women. While here are many reasons for he gender gap in personal income satisfaction, he main reason is likely ha women still earn less han men. In 2005, he gender pay gap was around 16.8 percent. By 2021, i had shrunk o 13.5 percent.13 Thus, women and men have converged in erms of income satisfaction, similarly o how hey are converging in wages.",
    "There are also differences between eas and wes Germany. For example, people in eas Germany are considerably more dissatisfied with heir personal income compared o peo­ ple in wes Germany. The average value in eas Germany was 4.9 points in 2004 compared o an average 5.7 points in wes Germany. By 2021, he personal income satisfaction gap between eas and wes Germany had shrunk consider­ ably. In 2021, eas Germans (6.7) were nearly as satisfied as wes Germans (6.9). The pay gap between eas and west, which has become smaller over he years, may be relevan here. While he gross hourly wage in eas Germany was only around 75 percen of he gross hourly wage in wes Germany in 2004, i had increased o around 87 percen in 2021.14 In regards o age, people below 30 were considerably less sat­ isfied with heir personal income (4.9) han people above 30 (5.7), although he gap has decreased over he years. In 2021, for example, younger adults’ personal income satisfaction was 6.5, while i was 6.9 for older adults over 30. People who are finishing raining or an apprenticeship or who recently began heir professional career were increasingly more sat­ isfied with heir personal income. One possible reason for this could be how he labor marke has changed over he las 20 years. The early 2000s were characterized by unem­ ploymen and limited labor marke prospects, especially for young people.15 By 2022, half of all companies were affected by a shortage of skilled professionals.16 This is likely o have had a positive impac on starting salaries and he general labor marke for young people. This was hen possibly also reflected in young people’s income satisfaction. In erms of household income, he respondents are divided into hree groups of equal size and compared: he lowes income earners (firs ercile), he middle-income earners (second ercile), and he highes income earners (third er­ cile). Unsurprisingly, personal income satisfaction differs 13 OECD, “Gender Wage Gap,” (2024) (available online; accessed on June 20, 2024.) Relative dif­ ferences in he mean values (median) are reported. 14 Jannik André Nauerth and Johan Pflanz, “Lohnlücke Ost-Wes – Ewige Disparitä oder schiefer Vergleich?” Ifo Dresden berichte 30, no. 5 (2023): 8–13. 15 Sandra Buchholz und Karin Kurz, “Increasing employmen instability among young people?

While hese differences are considerable, he gaps did narrow o some exten in 2021: The gap between",
    "he highes and middle incomes shrank (from 1.0 o 0.8) and the gap between he lowes and middle incomes remained the same (1.2). In principle, his gap indicates ha he addi­ tional satisfaction from additional income decreases along the income distribution. There are no discernible differences between people with and withou children over he entire period; both are equally satisfied with heir income. Differences in work satisfaction are comparably low Working women and men in Germany are similarly satis­ fied with heir work (Figure 3). Considering ha women, on average, repor lower satisfaction with heir personal income on average, his similarity is remarkable. While women are more dissatisfied han men in erms of heir income, other aspects of heir jobs, like colleagues, work hours, field, and the demands placed on such aspects do no appear o resul in differences in work satisfaction. Compared o wes Germany, people in eas Germany were more dissatisfied with heir work from 2004 o 2018. Despite this, he gap shrunk from 0.5 o 0.3 points in his period and there have been no more differences between he regions since 2019. One possible explanation for hese differences and he subsequen convergence could be economic differ­ ences between eas and wes Germany. For historical reasons, the economic structure in eas Germany differs greatly from tha in wes Germany. For example, people in eas Germany frequently work in differen professions han people in wes Germany.18 The headquarters and research departments of large companies are still located in he west. Above all, how­ ever, unemploymen in eas Germany was high for a long time, which likely resulted in a far more pronounced fear of unemploymen in he east.19 This could lead o average work satisfaction being lower in eas Germany compared o wes Germany. Catch-up processes may ultimately have led o a convergence of work satisfaction in eas and wes Germany. When comparing people under and over 30, i is noticeable tha he under-30 group has, on average, greater work sat­ isfaction han he over-30 group. This gap remained largely constan over he observation period. However, he differ­ ence in work satisfaction was only 0.2 points in 2021. This 17 For his analysis, he ne household income was needs-adjusted using he square roo of he household size. Further, i was deflated using he consumer price index. 18 Jannik André Nauerth and Johan Pflanz, “Lohnlücke Ost-Wes – Ewige Disparitä oder schiefer Vergleich?” Ifo Dresden berichte 30, no. 5 (2023): 8–13. 19 Michaela Fuchs e al., “Baustelle Arbeitsmark – die Beschäftigungsdynamik in Os und Wes ha sich angeglichen,” IAB-Forum 9 (2018) (available online). 216 DIW Weekly Repor 32+33+34/2024 SATISFACTION Figure 3 Work satisfaction Scale from 0 (no a all satisfied) o 10 (completely satisfied) Source: Authors’ calculations based on SOEP data. © DIW Berlin 2024 Differences in work satisfaction are only observed between he differen income groups. 217 DIW Weekly Repor 32+33+34/2024 SATISFACTION could be related o he fac ha younger people have no been working for very long and hus",
    "still have a multitude of career developmen possibilities and paths before hem, which decrease with age. A he same ime, younger peo­ ple often do no ye have any additional family responsibili­ ties and may herefore no require as much flexibility from their employers. The greates differences in work satisfaction are between the groups with differen household incomes. Low-income earners (firs ercile) were he mos dissatisfied with work, followed by middle-income earners and high-income earn­ ers (second and hird erciles). The differences were great­ es between he lowes and middle income erciles. The dif­ ference was around 0.5 points in 2004 bu had sunk o 0.3 points by 2021, and he gap between he middle and high­ es incomes sank from 0.4 o 0.2. One possible explanation for his is ha people from he bo om hird of earners more frequently have jobs with poor working conditions, such as shif work, li le schedule flexibility, and significan physi­ cal and mental burdens. These are factors ha have been proven o negatively affec work satisfaction.20 Similar o gender, no significan differences can be found between people with and withou children over he obser­ vation period. Men have higher health satisfaction han women On average, men were more satisfied with heir health han women (Figure 4): While men reported health satisfaction of 6.6 points in 2004, women reported only 6.3. The ime series of he wo ran almos parallel until 2020. In 2021, both values increased by around 0.3 points, likely an effec of he corona­ virus pandemic. Thus, men report, on average, ha hey are in be er health han women. Moreover, studies show ha men go o he doctor less frequently and are also less likely to be absen from work due o illness.21 However, men die earlier and are more affected by some common diseases han women. A he same ime, women suffer more frequently from some hormone-related physical and mental illnesses, especially in relation o he menstrual cycle, pregnancy, birth, and menopause. Thus, when observing differen indicators of health, i is often unclear whether women or men are health­ ier. Differing gender norms could also explain he continu­ ing gap in health satisfaction between men and women. For example, studies have shown ha mos people find i socially inacceptable for men o alk abou heir health problems.22 There are also ongoing differences between people with and withou children: On average, parents were more dissatisfied with heir health (6.2 in 2004) han people withou children 20 Sarah A. Burgard and Katherine Y. Lin, “Bad Jobs, Bad Health?

(6.7). The gap increased o 0.6 points by 2021, with he health satisfaction of",
    "people withou children increasing in particu­ lar (7.3 compared o 6.7 for parents). As parenthood is associ­ ated with stress factors, such as less and worse sleep,23 rela­ tionship problems,24 less ime for relaxation,25 and finan­ cial issues,26 his is no surprising. Numerous studies have already shown ha many people are less satisfied with heir physical or mental health after becoming parents.27 Differences between eas and wes Germany have lessened over ime: People in eas Germany were more dissatisfied with heir health han people in wes Germany. In 2004, he difference was 0.4 points and by 2021, i had shrunk o only 0.1 points. Many eas Germans have fragmented employ­ men histories due o heir experiences post-reunification. A he same ime, significan health differences between people of high and low socioeconomic status, for example approximated by employmen status, are well documented in he scientific literature.28 Compared o people over 30, people under 30 were 1.4 points more satisfied with heir health on average in 2004. Surprisingly, his difference had been steadily decreasing until 2021; ha year, he difference was only 1.1 points. One explanation for his convergence could be ha he state of health in old age is steadily improving across birth cohorts.29 When looking a he differen household income groups, peo­ ple from he bo om hird were he leas satisfied with heir health, followed by people from he middle hird, while he highes income earners were he mos satisfied with heir health. The gaps between he groups were around 0.4 points each and have remained relatively constan over he years. This may reflec he well-documented socio-economic dif­ ferences in health in Germany.30 23 David Richter e al., “Long-term effects of pregnancy and childbirth on sleep satisfaction and duration of first-time and experienced mothers and fathers,” Sleep 42, no. 4 (2019): zsz015. 24 Manon A. van Scheppingen e al., “Self-Esteem and Relationship Satisfaction During he Tran­ sition o Motherhood,” Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 114, no. 6 (2018): 973–991. 25 Amy Claxton and Maureen Perry-Jenkins, “No Fun Anymore: Leisure and Marital Quality Across he Transition o Parenthood,” Journal of Marriage and Family 70, no. 1 (2008): 28–43. 26 Ma hias Pollmann-Schult, “Parenthood and Life Satisfaction: Why Don’ Children Make People Happy?” Journal of Marriage and Family 76, no. 2 (2014): 319–336. 27 Michael D.

In regard to income satisfaction, he gap between people in eas and wes Germany, women and men, and younger and older people have shrunk markedly or closed com­ pletely. However, hese positive findings are offse by he sometimes still serious group differences in erms of health satisfaction. The bo om hird of income earners as well as parents are especially dissatisfied with heir health. I canno be policy makers’ intention ha low income and parenthood are risk factors for well-being. I is heir duty to relieve hese groups; hey could star by improving he childcare system, reducing bureaucracy when applying for benefits, and making low-threshold suppor services more visible.
