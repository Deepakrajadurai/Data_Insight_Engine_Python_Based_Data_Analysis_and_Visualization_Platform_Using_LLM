Behr, Till Köveker, and Merve Kücük\n\nABSTRACT\n\nIn 2023, heating energy prices increased by substantial \n\n31 percent compared to the previous year, following a 33 per­\n\ncent increase already seen in 2022. Calculations based on \n\ndata from the energy service provider ista show average price \n\nincreases were the highest in the German state of Rhine­\n\nland-Palatinate, and the lowest in Hamburg. Owing to these \n\nprice hikes and ongoing energy-saving efforts, the tempera­\n\nture-adjusted heating energy consumption of two- and mul­\n\nti-apartment buildings in Germany covered in this study fell \n\nby an average of four percent compared to the previous year, \n\nwhich was slightly less than the decline observed in 2022. The \n\nbiggest energy savings were seen in households in Saxony. \n\nAt the same time, temperature-adjusted CO2 emissions per \n\nsquare meter also fell, although to a slightly lesser extent than \n\nin 2022. With heating energy prices stabilizing, the momentum \n\nin emissions reductions is expected to slow down. If Germany \n\nis to meet its climate targets, further efforts are needed, par­\n\nticularly in improving energy efficiency in the building sector \n\nand in switching to renewable heating systems.\n\nThe impact of the gas price crisis continued to be felt strongly \n\nin 2023. Since Gazprom began restricting gas supply in the \n\nsecond half of 2021, and all the more so after Russia launched \n\nits attack on Ukraine in February 2022, gas and other heating \n\nfuels have become significantly more expensive in Germany. \n\nAfter dramatic price hikes in the first year of the war, prices \n\ncontinued their steep upward trend over the course of 2023.\n\nIn both 2022 and 2023, as a response to a looming gas short­\n\nage and the ever-increasing burden on private households, \n\nthe German government took various measures in an attempt \n\nto reduce energy consumption while simultaneously allevi­\n\nating the burden on private households. In December 2022, \n\nfor instance, households’ monthly heating bill for gas and \n\ndistrict heating was paid by the government.1 In January \n\n2023, a gas and heating price cap was introduced to be appli­\n\ncable for private households and small and medium-sized \n\nenterprises. For natural gas consumers, the cap was set at \n\n12 cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh). This price was applied to \n\n80 percent of the projected annual heating energy consump­\n\ntion in September 2022.2 Any consumption beyond that had \n\nto be paid at the regular market price. Similarly, for house­\n\nholds using district heating, heating costs were capped at \n\n9.5 cents per kWh. The relief granted by the state had to be \n\nclearly indicated on the heating bill. The aim of this instru­\n\nment was to maintain the incentive to reduce heating energy \n\nconsumption through higher energy prices while simultane­\n\nously protecting consumers from overly high prices.3 This \n\nmeasure came into force on March 1, 2023 (and also ret­\n\nroactively included January and February) and expired on \n\nDecember 31, 2023.\n\n1\t\n\nBundesregierung, “Energie-Rabatt für Haushalte und Unternehmen,” 2023 (in German; availa-\n\nble online, accessed October 14, 2024; this applies to all other online sources in this report unless \n\nstated otherwise).\n\n2\t If a household reduces its heating energy consumption by more than 20 percent in compar­\n\nison to the previous year, the annual statement will show these entire savings reimbursed at the \n\nnew, higher energy price, meaning that the greater incentives created by the new higher prices \n\napply to the entirety of saving.\n\n3\t The gas and heating price cap applied to private households, small and medium-sized enter­\n\nprises with a gas consumption of less than 1.5 million kilowatt-hours per year, as well as clubs and \n\nassociations. Cf. Bundesregierung, “Fragen und Antworten zu den Energiepreisbremsen,” 2024 (in \n\nGerman; available online).\n\n265\n\nDIW Weekly Report 45/2024\n\nHEAT MONITOR 2023\n\nIn response to the energy price crisis, Germany has stepped \n\nup its efforts to lessen its dependence on fossil fuels in the \n\nbuilding sector. The goal was to further reduce Europe’s \n\ndependence on (Russian) gas imports, on the one hand, and \n\nmeet the climate targets outlined in the Paris Agreement, \n\non the other. In 2022 and 2023, emissions from the German \n\nbuilding sector totaled 108 and 102 million tonnes of CO2 \n\nequivalent, respectively,4 which is considerably higher \n\n4 To be able to compare the impact of different climate-active gases, they are converted into \n\nCO2 equivalents. This involves converting emissions of greenhouse gases other than CO2 into CO2 \n\nequivalents based on their global warming potential.\n\nBox 1\n\nDatabase und methodology used for Heat Monitor 2023\n\nIn partnership with ista SE (former ista Deutsschland GmbH), one \n\nof the largest energy service providers in Germany, the DIW Berlin \n\nhas developed the Heat Monitor Germany in 2014. The Monitor re­\n\nports regional and national trends in heating energy consumption, \n\nenergy prices and heating expenditures for residential buildings \n\non an annual basis. The calculations are based on (1) building-level \n\nheating bills from ista SE for about 300000 residential buildings \n\nwith two or more apartments (more than two million apartments), \n\n(2) climate adjustment factors from the German Weather Service \n\n(Deutscher Wetterdienst), and (3) census survey results from the \n\nGerman Federal Statistical Office. The heating bills contain infor­\n\nmation on energy consumption, billing periods, heating fuel type, \n\nenergy costs, and building location and size.\n\nThe heating bills capture residential buildings with two or multi \n\napartments – i.e., the sample covers buildings, owned or rented, \n\nwith at least two households. We further limit the sample of build­\n\nings to those with heated living space of between 15 and 250 \n\nsquare meters per apartment. Note that we do not have a random \n\nsample from the population of residential buildings in Germany. \n\nIn comparison with the 2014 microcensus supplementary survey, \n\nbuildings with three to six apartments and larger buildings (13 or \n\nmore apartments) are overrepresented in the sample. We offset \n\nthis by weighting average heating consumption according to the \n\nrelative importance of each building size category in the statistical \n\npopulation. To accomplish this, we use results from the 2010 mi­\n\ncrocensus supplementary survey that indicate the shares of each \n\nbuilding size category by spatial planning region (ROR).\n\nFor each building, we calculate the temperature-adjusted heat­\n\ning energy consumption by adjusting total energy consumed for \n\nheating for local changes in the climate and weather. To ensure \n\ncomparability across time and space, we use information from the \n\nGerman Weather Service. The available weighting factors normal­\n\nizes heating consumption to climatic condition in Potsdam, the \n\nreference location.1\n\nWe calculate the annual quantity of heating energy consumption \n\nin relation to the heated living space of a building. This is carried \n\nout in several steps: First, building-specific consumption values are \n\n1 \n\nThe effect of different temperature correction methods was determined in a study from 2022. \n\nThe study shows that the results of the temperature-corrected values do not differ greatly. See Pe­\n\nter Mellwig et al., “Klimaschutz im Gebäudebereich: Erklärungen für stagnierende CO2-Emissionen \n\ntrotz erfolgreicher Sanierungsmaßnahmen,” Short study commissioned by Agora Energiewende \n\n2022 (in German; available online).\n\nlimited to the amounts of energy used for heating space (excluding \n\nwarm water). Second, the consumption value is multiplied by the \n\nheating value corresponding to the building’s energy fuel type, giv­\n\ning us the absolute heating energy consumption in kilowatt-hours \n\n(kWh) for a building in a billing period. Third, the values are allocat­\n\ned to a specific heating year, since the closing date for measure­\n\nment is not always December 31 of the relevant year. Fourth, we \n\nadjust the consumption values for the climatic conditions during \n\nthe heating period in question and divide it by the amount of heat­\n\ning space in the building. The units are kilowatt-hours required per \n\nsquare meter of heated living space per year (kWh/sqm).\n\nLastly, average heating demand values at the regional level are \n\ncomputed as the weighted arithmetic mean for the overall building \n\nstock of a region – for weights, we use the proportion of buildings \n\nin each housing size category (two, three to six, seven to twelve, 13 \n\nto 20, and over 21 apartments) at the regional level.\n\nHeating bills are created with a time lag. The values of the 2021 \n\nheating period are calculated based on a smaller sample than the \n\nvalues for earlier years. For 2023, around 50 percent of the homes \n\nare available, compared to 2022. The results for 2023 should \n\ntherefore be regarded as preliminary. For heating consumption, a \n\ncorrection was made by calculating a hypothetical value for 2023 \n\nenergy consumption and by correcting the energy consumption \n\nfor 2022 with the national trend. It is possible, however, that an \n\nupdate may nevertheless result in retroactive corrections.\n\nTo calculate the price and consumption changes in the different \n\nregions, the prices for one kilowatt hour of heating energy and the \n\ntemperature-adjusted heating energy requirements per square \n\nmeter in 2023 are compared with those from 2022. As the con­\n\ntracts of households do not reflect the wholesale price, but usually \n\na price fixed for one or two years is paid, the energy prices in \n\n2023 differed greatly depending on when the new contract was \n\nconcluded and what the energy cost level was at the time. Energy \n\nprices also differ significantly from region to region. For these \n\nreasons, only the energy prices and requirements of buildings \n\nfor which data is available in both 2022 and 2023 are compared. \n\nBuildings that appear in the data set for 2022 but for which no data \n\nis currently available for 2023 are not included in this analysis. \n\nTherefore, the changes in prices and requirements per federal \n\nstate or region shown in Figures 3 and 4 and in the text cannot be \n\ndirectly compared with the figures in the table, which are based on \n\nall buildings available for the respective year.\n\n266\n\nDIW Weekly Report 45/2024\n\nHEAT MONITOR 2023\n\nthan the 67 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent specified in \n\nGermany’s climate action targets for 2030.5\n\nDIW Berlin’s Heat Monitor Germany analyzes heating \n\nenergy consumption, energy prices, and heating expendi­\n\ntures as well as the resulting CO2 emissions for residential \n\nbuildings on an annual basis. The calculations are based \n\non heating energy bills for two- and multi-apartment build­\n\nings. The comprehensive dataset, which comprises around \n\n300,000 buildings and was provided by energy service pro­\n\nvider ista SE (formerly ista Deutschland GmbH)6, is weighted \n\non the basis of the German microcensus, and therefore \n\npaints a representative picture for the whole of Germany. \n\nOur  analysis for 2023 is based on energy bill data already \n\navailable for over 170,000 buildings (Box 1).\n\nThis year’s analysis focuses on the continued savings in heat­\n\ning energy consumption as well as the development of heat­\n\ning costs and prices in the first year after the beginning of the \n\nenergy price crisis. The analysis of heating energy prices and \n\nconsumption, which previously included gas and oil heating \n\n5 Bundesministerium für Umwelt, Naturschutz, nukleare Sicherheit und Verbraucherschutz, \n\n“Das neue Klimaschutzgesetz – Jahresemissionsmengen nach Bereichen bis 2030,” 2024 (in Ger­\n\nman; available online)\n\n6 Alongside its competitor Techem, ista is one of the two largest billing companies for heating \n\nand hot water in Germany. In 2017, the two companies combined held a market share of around \n\n50 percent.\n\nonly, was extended this year to include district heating. The \n\nincreasing share of district heating, which currently accounts \n\nfor around 15 percent of homes in Germany, is thus taken \n\ninto account as a potentially sustainable heat source in the \n\nheat supply.7 Consequently, the average prices for 2023 and \n\nthe historical comparison years listed in this report now also \n\ninclude district heating.\n\nHeating energy consumption remains higher in \n\nthe west than in the east and south of Germany\n\nHeating energy consumption8 in two- and multi-apartment \n\nbuildings continued to fall in 2023 (Figure 1). In fact, the aver­\n\nage temperature-adjusted heating consumption of 118 kWh \n\nper square meter of heated living space was 3.8 percent lower \n\nthan in the previous year (123 kWh) and nine percent lower \n\nthan in 2021 (130 kWh). The combination of higher heating \n\nenergy prices, alongside appeals to save energy during the \n\n2022/2023 heating period, and targeted measures to reduce \n\nheating energy consumption (such as hydraulic balancing, \n\nadditional energy efficiency measures, heating curve adjust­\n\nments) had a noticeable impact on the heating energy con­\n\nsumption in 2023. However, the increase in prices could \n\nnot be offset by the savings in demand, resulting in higher \n\nexpenditures for households.\n\nWe observe significant regional differences in heating energy \n\nconsumption, specifically between the west and northwest \n\nof Germany, on the one hand, and the east and south, on \n\nthe other. Once again, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania \n\nconsumed the least heating energy at 99 kWh per square \n\nmeter. As in the previous year, Saarland was at the other \n\nend of the scale with the highest consumption of 137 kWh \n\nper square meter (Table and Figure 2). Taken together, the \n\nwestern German states consumed 121 kWh per square meter, \n\nexceeding the heating energy consumption of their east­\n\nern German counterparts, which required an average of \n\n111 kWh (Figure 1). A possible explanation for this could be \n\nthe higher retrofit rates for residential buildings in the east­\n\nern German states.9\n\nAt the regional level, the differences between the highest \n\nand lowest level of consumption are even more pronounced. \n\nCentral Mecklenburg/Rostock had the lowest average heating \n\nenergy consumption in Germany at 87 kWh per square meter, \n\nfollowed by Western Pomerania at 98 kWh. East Fresia, in \n\ncontrast, consumed far more heating energy with 140 kWh \n\nper square meter. The Saar region was in second place with \n\n137 kWh.\n\n7 This corresponds to around six percent of residential buildings in Germany, cf. BDEW (2024): \n\nWie heizt Deutschland 2023?

regional differences in price changes and \n\nconsumption per square meter\n\nThe median heating energy price for 2023, accounting for \n\nrebates granted under the energy price cap, was 11.81 cents \n\nper kWh. In 2023, Germany saw a 31.4 percent increase over \n\nthe previous year, which was almost as high as the increase \n\nin the first year after the start of the war on Ukraine, when \n\nenergy prices rose by 33.3 percent (Figure 3). This corre­\n\nsponds to a 75-percent increase in average prices compared \n\nto 2021.\n\nThere are several reasons for this sharp increase in energy \n\nprices despite the price cap. First, the cap applied to gas and \n\ndistrict heating only;10 second; the average prices for 2022 \n\nwere far lower than the price cap; and third, the price cap \n\napplied only to 80 percent of past consumption. If a house­\n\nhold was only able to reduce its consumption by less than \n\n20 percent compared to 2022 and the new contractual price \n\nwould have been higher than the level of the price cap, the \n\nresulting average price for this household would exceed the \n\nprice cap.\n\nArguably the main reason why heating energy prices con­\n\ntinued to increase in 2023, as compared to 2022, was that \n\n10 In 2023, there was also an electricity price cap. However, this only impacted heating  energy \n\nprices for a very small number of households, as only a very small proportion of buildings in \n\nGermany have electric heating. Since the present analysis is limited to the three dominant heat­\n\ning energy sources—gas, oil, and district heating—the electricity price cap has no effect for the \n\nsample considered.\n\nAnother area where we observe stark differences between \n\nGerman states is in the billed heating prices (Table). Median \n\nheating prices were the lowest in Bremen with 11.08 cents \n\nper kWh, followed by Baden-Württemberg with 11.15 cents. \n\nIn contrast, Berlin and Brandenburg had the highest heat­\n\ning prices with median prices of 12.87 and 12.80 cents per \n\nkWh, respectively. Regional differences at the more granular \n\nlevel were even more pronounced. Households in Prignitz-\n\nOberhavel and Central Schleswig-Holstein paid 14.60 and \n\n13.93 cents per kWh, making their median prices the high­\n\nest. Median heating prices in Altmark, Saxony-Anhalt, were \n\nlowest at just 8.84 cents per kWh, followed by Bodensee-\n\nOberschwaben at 9.03 cents.\n\nBox 2\n\nCalculation of CO₂ emissions\n\nTo calculate a building’s CO2 emissions, the heating energy \n\nconsumption per square meter is multiplied by the emis­\n\nsion factors of each energy carrier (Table). To allow for a \n\n comparison with emissions in the building sector for the \n\nwhole of Germany, only direct CO2 emissions are calculated. \n\nUpstream emissions resulting from energy extraction, trans­\n\nport, and transformation (for example when generating elec­\n\ntricity and district heating) are not taken into account.\n\nTo calculate representative average annual CO₂ emissions \n\nper square meter, the annual CO2 emissions per square meter \n\nare weighted for each property according to the share of the \n\nbuilding category in the statistical population. The weighting \n\nis similar to the calculation for temperature-adjusted heating \n\nenergy consumption (Box 1). In other words, the different build­\n\ning size categories are weighted according to their share in \n\nthe microcensus.\n\nFigure 3\n\nEnergy prices\n\nWeighted median of natural gas, oil prices, and district \n\nheating in euro cents per kilowatt-hour (left axis), change \n\nin percent (right axis)\n\n \n\nSource: ista SE; authors’ own calculations.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nIn the two years 2022 and 2023, the increase in energy prices adds up \n\nto 75 percent.\n\nTable\n\nCO2 emission factors depending on \n\nenergy carrier\n\nEnergy carrier\n\nCO2 emission factor\n\nNatural gas (H)\n\n0.201\n\nNatural gas (L)\n\n0.201\n\nOil\n\n0.266\n\nHeavy oil\n\n0.293\n\nLignite\n\n0.359\n\nCoke\n\n0.389\n\nHard coal\n\n0.345\n\nLiquified gas\n\n0.236\n\nDistrict heating\n\n0\n\nElectricity\n\n0\n\nPellets\n\n0\n\nWood\n\n0\n\nWood chips\n\n0\n\nSource: Umweltbundesamt 2014\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\n271\n\nDIW Weekly Report 45/2024\n\nHEAT MONITOR 2023\n\nsome households did not have to pay the higher energy \n\nprices until 2023. Thanks to the one to two-year energy price \n\nplans signed up for in advance, they were not subject to \n\nprice increases in 2022. The different contract structures \n\ntherefore resulted in a significant increase in price variation. \n\nAccordingly, there are households that came through the \n\ncrisis almost unscathed, while others ended up paying very \n\nhigh prices. At the federal state level, Rhineland-Palatinate \n\nsaw the biggest price increase with 45.2 percent, while the \n\nstate of Hamburg recorded the smallest increase with just \n\n8.8 percent in comparison to the previous year.\n\nThe biggest energy savings in 2023 were recorded in Saxony, \n\nwhich reduced their heating energy consumption by 5.8 per­\n\ncent. Saarland and Brandenburg, in contrast, saw the small­\n\nest reductions in consumption (2.6 and 2.8 percent, respec­\n\ntively). One of the reasons households did not save more, \n\ndespite the steep price increases, was likely the energy effi­\n\nciency of the buildings, something over which particularly \n\ntenant households generally have no influence. Hence, the \n\nrelation between price increases and reduced heating energy \n\nconsumption is not clear (Figure 4). The fact that reduced \n\nconsumption cannot fully offset these sharp price increases \n\nis also reflected in the steep rise in overall heating expendi­\n\ntures, with 2023 seeing an increase in heating energy expend­\n\niture of around 24 percent over the previous year (compared \n\nto 2021, the last year before the energy crisis, the increase \n\nwas as high as 54 percent).\n\nPrice and demand structure for district heating \n\ndiffers noticeably from gas and oil\n\nDistrict heating and heat networks have the potential to \n\nmake a significant contribution to the decarbonization of \n\nheat supply: They can be operated with sustainable energy \n\nsources and are more efficient than building-internal gas \n\nand oil-based heating systems. In order to map the poten­\n\ntial switch to sustainable sources in heat generation, this \n\nyear for the first time the Heat Monitor’s analysis of heat­\n\ning energy prices covers not just oil and gas but also district \n\nheating. The analysis clearly shows that the price range for \n\ndistrict heating is considerably wider than for gas and oil \n\n(Figure 5). Similarly, the median price of district heating \n\nper kilowatt-hour is, on average, substantially higher than \n\nthose for gas and oil.\n\nThat said, at 97 kWh per square meter, heating consumption \n\nfor district heating is 24 percent lower than for oil (127 kWh) \n\nand 19 percent lower than for gas (120 kWh) (Figure 6). \n\nDifferences in price and demand for district heating arise, \n\namong other reasons, from the fact that heat is supplied \n\ndirectly with district heating, whereas with gas and heat­\n\ning oil, there are conversion losses due to heat generation \n\nin the house. Another reason for the lower average heating \n\nenergy consumption for district heating is that buildings sup­\n\nplied with district heating have, on average, more residential \n\nunits than buildings, which are heated with gas or oil. These \n\nlarger buildings have less outer walls per square meter of liv­\n\ning space, resulting in lower heating energy requirements.\n\nFigure 4\n\nChange in (temperature-adjusted) heating energy consumption \n\nand heating energy prices in two and multi-apartment buildings \n\n(2022–2023) \n\nIn percent\n\n \n\nNote: Billed heating costs are a weighted average of natural gas, oil, and district heating prices. To calculate the \n\nchanges, only buildings that could be observed in both 2022 and 2023 are taken into account and weighted using the \n\nmicrocensus. For this reason, this figure is not comparable with the table.\n\nSource: ista SE; authors’ own calculations.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nSavings in consumption were not necessarily related to price increases: Households \n\nin Saxony saved the most on heating energy, even though prices did not rise that \n\nmuch there in 2023. \n\n272\n\nDIW Weekly Report 45/2024\n\nHEAT MONITOR 2023\n\nEmissions reductions losing momentum\n\nLast year, building sector emissions in Germany amounted \n\nto 102 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent.11 This is 51 percent \n\nless than in 1990. Nevertheless, for Germany to meet its 2030 \n\nclimate targets, the building sector has to reduce its emis­\n\nsions by 69 percent compared to 1990 levels.\n\nA building’s CO2 emissions depend on multiple factors \n\n(Box 2), in particular its energy efficiency and the heating \n\nsystem used. The emissions per square meter for the two- \n\nand multi-apartment buildings examined here continue to \n\nbe on a downward trend (Figure 7). With 19.1 kilos per square \n\nmeter of heated living space, the CO2 emissions attributed to \n\nheating were eight percent lower in 2023 than in the previ­\n\nous year. Temperature-adjusted, however, this corresponds \n\nto a 4.3 percent reduction only, as 2023 was a relatively mild \n\nyear. Thus, although the downward trend has continued, the \n\nreduction in emissions was lower in 2023 than the 5.6 per­\n\ncent observed in the previous year (16 percent without tem­\n\nperature adjustment). Given the smaller decrease in heating \n\nenergy consumption, it is not surprising that emissions lev­\n\nels are no longer falling as dramatically, but the momentum \n\nin the building sector is still not enough to meet Germany’s \n\nclimate targets.\n\nConclusion: Greater investment in building \n\nenergy efficiency needed\n\nIn 2023, once again, households faced strong increases in \n\nheating costs compared to the previous year—amounting to \n\n31 percent, on average. That being said, there were strong \n\nregional variations. These resulted, on the one hand, from \n\nthe different types of fuel used, as well as from the differ­\n\nent types of contracts used by electricity and gas suppliers. \n\nOther important factors might be the different points in \n\ntime at which contracts were concluded or oil tanks filled.\n\nThe analysis shows that, in 2023, the (now expired) energy \n\nprice cap to protect households from potentially extreme \n\nheating cost hikes was indeed effective. For the majority \n\nof households, the unit prices billed were not substantially \n\nhigher than the price cap of 12 cents. When it came to dis­\n\ntrict heating, on the other hand, the average price of heat­\n\ning energy was 13 cents per kWh—well above the price cap \n\nof 9.5 cents per kWh. With the price cap only applying to \n\n80 percent of forecasted consumption and anything above \n\nthis being charged at given market energy prices, 2023 saw \n\na very high average price for district heating in many places.\n\nDespite similar price increases as in 2022, heating energy \n\nsavings in 2023 were lower than in the previous year. \n\nTemperature-adjusted, private households consumed 3.8 per­\n\ncent less heating energy than in 2022. In the previous year, \n\nthe saving was 5.3 percent. One reason for this might be that \n\n11 Umweltbundesamt, “Treibhausgasminderungsziele Deutschlands,” 2024 (in German; \n\navailable online).\n\nFigure 5\n\nHeating energy prices in two- and multi-apartment buildings by \n\nenergy source \n\nEuro cents per kilowatt-hour\n\n \n\nNote: The shaded areas show the price variance. \n\nSource: ista SE; authors‘ own calculations.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nAverage prices for district heating are higher than for gas and oil and also show a \n\nstronger variation.\n\nFigure 6\n\nHeating energy consumption in two- and multi-apartment \n\nbuildings by energy source \n\nAnnual heating energy consumption in kilowatt-hours per square \n\nmeter of heating living space; temperature-adjusted \n\n \n\nSource: ista SE; authors‘ own calculations.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nHeating energy consumption per square meter is significantly lower for district \n\nheating than for oil and gas.\n\n273\n\nDIW Weekly Report 45/2024\n\nHEAT MONITOR 2023\n\nin 2023, much less attention was devoted to saving heating \n\nenergy than in 2022. Another reason might be that the poten­\n\ntial to save energy through changes in consumer behavior \n\nhad already been exhausted in some households. In some \n\nregions, however, savings were more than twice as high as \n\nthe national average. This indicates that savings in heating \n\nenergy and therefore also emissions are still possible in the \n\nshort term – whether through behavioral adjustments or \n\nenergy-efficient renovations.\n\nThe months following the energy price crisis of 2022/2023 \n\nsaw the price pressure on the supply side decrease as whole­\n\nsale energy prices dropped and started to stabilize. In the \n\nyears ahead, however, the cost of CO2 emissions from fos­\n\nsil fuels is likely to increase heating costs for private house­\n\nholds. That said, the energy price crisis has demonstrated \n\nthat higher heating costs have a limited impact on people’s \n\nheating behavior and therefore also CO2 emissions.\n\nWhen it comes to reducing emissions, the momentum is \n\nthus unlikely to continue unless it is supported by other \n\nmeans. Yet, emissions have to be reduced for the climate tar­\n\ngets in the building sector to be met. The Expert Commission \n\non Gas and Heat has proposed a number of specific meas­\n\nures to achieve these reductions. The advice and in-kind \n\ncontributions intended to help households reduce their \n\nheating energy and electricity consumption should there­\n\nfore be strengthened. Even more importantly, however, the \n\n energy-efficient retrofits of inefficient buildings as well as the \n\nswitch to sustainable heating systems such as heat pumps \n\nmust be accelerated. If this is not vigorously pursued, we \n\ncan expect that heating energy consumption and thus also \n\nemissions in the building sector will rise again in the com­\n\ning years.\n\nFigure 7\n\nDevelopment of CO₂ emissions in the residential building sector \n\nIn kilograms of CO₂ per square meter of heated living space \n\n \n\nSource: ista SE; authors’ own calculations.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nCO₂ emissions from residential buildings fall steadily, albeit at a very slow pace.\n\nJEL: R31, Q21, Q40\n\nKeywords: Heating demand, heating costs, building energy efficiency, residential \n\nbuildings, gas prices\n\nSophie Behr is a research associate in the department of Climate Policy of DIW \n\nBerlin | sbehr@diw.de\n\nTill Köveker is a research associate in the department of Climate Policy of DIW \n\nBerlin | tkoeveker@diw.de\n\nMerve Kucuk is a research associate in the department of Climate Policy of \n\nDIW Berlin | mkucuk@diw.de",

Behr, Till Köveker, and Merve Kücük\n\nABSTRACT\n\nIn 2023, heating energy prices increased by substantial \n\n31 percen compared o he previous year, following a 33 per­\n\ncen increase already seen in 2022. Calculations based on \n\ndata from he energy service provider ista show average price \n\nincreases were he highes in he German state of Rhine­\n\nland-Palatinate, and he lowes in Hamburg. Owing o hese \n\nprice hikes and ongoing energy-saving efforts, he empera­\n\nture-adjusted heating energy consumption of wo- and mul­\n\nti-apartmen buildings in Germany covered in his study fell \n\nby an average of four percen compared o he previous year, \n\nwhich was slightly less han he decline observed in 2022. The \n\nbigges energy savings were seen in households in Saxony. \n\nA he same ime, emperature-adjusted CO2 emissions per \n\nsquare meter also fell, although o a slightly lesser exten han \n\nin 2022. With heating energy prices stabilizing, he momentum \n\nin emissions reductions is expected o slow down. If Germany \n\nis o mee its climate argets, further efforts are needed, par­\n\nticularly in improving energy efficiency in he building sector \n\nand in switching o renewable heating systems.\n\nThe impac of he gas price crisis continued o be fel strongly \n\nin 2023. Since Gazprom began restricting gas supply in he \n\nsecond half of 2021, and all he more so after Russia launched \n\nits a ack on Ukraine in February 2022, gas and other heating \n\nfuels have become significantly more expensive in Germany. \n\nAfter dramatic price hikes in he firs year of he war, prices \n\ncontinued heir steep upward rend over he course of 2023.\n\nIn both 2022 and 2023, as a response o a looming gas short­\n\nage and he ever-increasing burden on private households, \n\nthe German governmen ook various measures in an a emp \n\nto reduce energy consumption while simultaneously allevi­\n\nating he burden on private households. In December 2022, \n\nfor instance, households’ monthly heating bill for gas and \n\ndistric heating was paid by he government.1 In January \n\n2023, a gas and heating price cap was introduced o be appli­\n\ncable for private households and small and medium-sized \n\nenterprises. For natural gas consumers, he cap was se a \n\n12 cents per kilowa -hour (kWh). This price was applied o \n\n80 percen of he projected annual heating energy consump­\n\ntion in September 2022.2 Any consumption beyond ha had \n\nto be paid a he regular marke price. Similarly, for house­\n\nholds using distric heating, heating costs were capped a \n\n9.5 cents per kWh. The relief granted by he state had o be \n\nclearly indicated on he heating bill. The aim of his instru­\n\nmen was o maintain he incentive o reduce heating energy \n\nconsumption hrough higher energy prices while simultane­\n\nously protecting consumers from overly high prices.3 This \n\nmeasure came into force on March 1, 2023 (and also ret­\n\nroactively included January and February) and expired on \n\nDecember 31, 2023.\n\n1\t\n\nBundesregierung, “Energie-Raba für Haushalte und Unternehmen,” 2023 (in German; availa-\n\nble online, accessed October 14, 2024; his applies o all other online sources in his repor unless \n\nstated otherwise).\n\n2\t If a household reduces its heating energy consumption by more han 20 percen in compar­\n\nison o he previous year, he annual statemen will show hese entire savings reimbursed a he \n\nnew, higher energy price, meaning ha he greater incentives created by he new higher prices \n\napply o he entirety of saving.\n\n3\t The gas and heating price cap applied o private households, small and medium-sized enter­\n\nprises with a gas consumption of less han 1.5 million kilowa -hours per year, as well as clubs and \n\nassociations.

Bundesregierung, “Fragen und Antworten zu den Energiepreisbremsen,” 2024 (in \n\nGerman; available online).\n\n265\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 45/2024\n\nHEAT MONITOR 2023\n\nIn response o he energy price crisis, Germany has stepped \n\nup its efforts o lessen its dependence on fossil fuels in he \n\nbuilding sector. The goal was o further reduce Europe’s \n\ndependence on (Russian) gas imports, on he one hand, and \n\nmee he climate argets outlined in he Paris Agreement, \n\non he other. In 2022 and 2023, emissions from he German \n\nbuilding sector otaled 108 and 102 million onnes of CO2 \n\nequivalent, respectively,4 which is considerably higher \n\n4 To be able o compare he impac of differen climate-active gases, hey are converted into \n\nCO2 equivalents. This involves converting emissions of greenhouse gases other han CO2 into CO2 \n\nequivalents based on heir global warming potential.\n\nBox 1\n\nDatabase und methodology used for Hea Monitor 2023\n\nIn partnership with ista SE (former ista Deutsschland GmbH), one \n\nof he larges energy service providers in Germany, he DIW Berlin \n\nhas developed he Hea Monitor Germany in 2014. The Monitor re­\n\nports regional and national rends in heating energy consumption, \n\nenergy prices and heating expenditures for residential buildings \n\non an annual basis. The calculations are based on (1) building-level \n\nheating bills from ista SE for abou 300000 residential buildings \n\nwith wo or more apartments (more han wo million apartments), \n\n(2) climate adjustmen factors from he German Weather Service \n\n(Deutscher We erdienst), and (3) census survey results from he \n\nGerman Federal Statistical Office. The heating bills contain infor­\n\nmation on energy consumption, billing periods, heating fuel ype, \n\nenergy costs, and building location and size.\n\nThe heating bills capture residential buildings with wo or multi \n\napartments – i.e., he sample covers buildings, owned or rented, \n\nwith a leas wo households. We further limi he sample of build­\n\nings o hose with heated living space of between 15 and 250 \n\nsquare meters per apartment. Note ha we do no have a random \n\nsample from he population of residential buildings in Germany. \n\nIn comparison with he 2014 microcensus supplementary survey, \n\nbuildings with hree o six apartments and larger buildings (13 or \n\nmore apartments) are overrepresented in he sample. We offse \n\nthis by weighting average heating consumption according o he \n\nrelative importance of each building size category in he statistical \n\npopulation. To accomplish his, we use results from he 2010 mi­\n\ncrocensus supplementary survey ha indicate he shares of each \n\nbuilding size category by spatial planning region (ROR).\n\nFor each building, we calculate he emperature-adjusted heat­\n\ning energy consumption by adjusting otal energy consumed for \n\nheating for local changes in he climate and weather. To ensure \n\ncomparability across ime and space, we use information from he \n\nGerman Weather Service. The available weighting factors normal­\n\nizes heating consumption o climatic condition in Potsdam, he \n\nreference location.1\n\nWe calculate he annual quantity of heating energy consumption \n\nin relation o he heated living space of a building. This is carried \n\nou in several steps: First, building-specific consumption values are \n\n1 \n\nThe effec of differen emperature correction methods was determined in a study from 2022. \n\nThe study shows ha he results of he emperature-corrected values do no differ greatly. See Pe­\n\nter Mellwig e al., “Klimaschutz im Gebäudebereich: Erklärungen für stagnierende CO2-Emissionen \n\ntrotz erfolgreicher Sanierungsmaßnahmen,” Shor study commissioned by Agora Energiewende \n\n2022 (in German; available online).\n\nlimited o he amounts of energy used for heating space (excluding \n\nwarm water). Second, he consumption value is multiplied by he \n\nheating value corresponding o he building’s energy fuel ype, giv­\n\ning us he absolute heating energy consumption in kilowa -hours \n\n(kWh) for a building in a billing period. Third, he values are allocat­\n\ned o a specific heating year, since he closing date for measure­\n\nmen is no always December 31 of he relevan year. Fourth, we \n\nadjus he consumption values for he climatic conditions during \n\nthe heating period in question and divide i by he amoun of heat­\n\ning space in he building. The units are kilowa -hours required per \n\nsquare meter of heated living space per year (kWh/sqm).\n\nLastly, average heating demand values a he regional level are \n\ncomputed as he weighted arithmetic mean for he overall building \n\nstock of a region – for weights, we use he proportion of buildings \n\nin each housing size category (two, hree o six, seven o welve, 13 \n\nto 20, and over 21 apartments) a he regional level.\n\nHeating bills are created with a ime lag. The values of he 2021 \n\nheating period are calculated based on a smaller sample han he \n\nvalues for earlier years. For 2023, around 50 percen of he homes \n\nare available, compared o 2022. The results for 2023 should \n\ntherefore be regarded as preliminary. For heating consumption, a \n\ncorrection was made by calculating a hypothetical value for 2023 \n\nenergy consumption and by correcting he energy consumption \n\nfor 2022 with he national rend. I is possible, however, ha an \n\nupdate may nevertheless resul in retroactive corrections.\n\nTo calculate he price and consumption changes in he differen \n\nregions, he prices for one kilowa hour of heating energy and he \n\ntemperature-adjusted heating energy requirements per square \n\nmeter in 2023 are compared with hose from 2022. As he con­\n\ntracts of households do no reflec he wholesale price, bu usually \n\na price fixed for one or wo years is paid, he energy prices in \n\n2023 differed greatly depending on when he new contrac was \n\nconcluded and wha he energy cos level was a he ime. Energy \n\nprices also differ significantly from region o region. For hese \n\nreasons, only he energy prices and requirements of buildings \n\nfor which data is available in both 2022 and 2023 are compared. \n\nBuildings ha appear in he data se for 2022 bu for which no data \n\nis currently available for 2023 are no included in his analysis. \n\nTherefore, he changes in prices and requirements per federal \n\nstate or region shown in Figures 3 and 4 and in he ex canno be \n\ndirectly compared with he figures in he able, which are based on \n\nall buildings available for he respective year.\n\n266\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 45/2024\n\nHEAT MONITOR 2023\n\nthan he 67 million onnes of CO2 equivalen specified in \n\nGermany’s climate action argets for 2030.5\n\nDIW Berlin’s Hea Monitor Germany analyzes heating \n\nenergy consumption, energy prices, and heating expendi­\n\ntures as well as he resulting CO2 emissions for residential \n\nbuildings on an annual basis. The calculations are based \n\non heating energy bills for wo- and multi-apartmen build­\n\nings. The comprehensive dataset, which comprises around \n\n300,000 buildings and was provided by energy service pro­\n\nvider ista SE (formerly ista Deutschland GmbH)6, is weighted \n\non he basis of he German microcensus, and herefore \n\npaints a representative picture for he whole of Germany. \n\nOur analysis for 2023 is based on energy bill data already \n\navailable for over 170,000 buildings (Box 1).\n\nThis year’s analysis focuses on he continued savings in heat­\n\ning energy consumption as well as he developmen of heat­\n\ning costs and prices in he firs year after he beginning of he \n\nenergy price crisis. The analysis of heating energy prices and \n\nconsumption, which previously included gas and oil heating \n\n5 Bundesministerium für Umwelt, Naturschutz, nukleare Sicherhei und Verbraucherschutz, \n\n“Das neue Klimaschutzgesetz – Jahresemissionsmengen nach Bereichen bis 2030,” 2024 (in Ger­\n\nman; available online)\n\n6 Alongside its competitor Techem, ista is one of he wo larges billing companies for heating \n\nand ho water in Germany. In 2017, he wo companies combined held a marke share of around \n\n50 percent.\n\nonly, was extended his year o include distric heating. The \n\nincreasing share of distric heating, which currently accounts \n\nfor around 15 percen of homes in Germany, is hus aken \n\ninto accoun as a potentially sustainable hea source in he \n\nhea supply.7 Consequently, he average prices for 2023 and \n\nthe historical comparison years listed in his repor now also \n\ninclude distric heating.\n\nHeating energy consumption remains higher in \n\nthe wes han in he eas and south of Germany\n\nHeating energy consumption8 in wo- and multi-apartmen \n\nbuildings continued o fall in 2023 (Figure 1). In fact, he aver­\n\nage emperature-adjusted heating consumption of 118 kWh \n\nper square meter of heated living space was 3.8 percen lower \n\nthan in he previous year (123 kWh) and nine percen lower \n\nthan in 2021 (130 kWh). The combination of higher heating \n\nenergy prices, alongside appeals o save energy during he \n\n2022/2023 heating period, and argeted measures o reduce \n\nheating energy consumption (such as hydraulic balancing, \n\nadditional energy efficiency measures, heating curve adjust­\n\nments) had a noticeable impac on he heating energy con­\n\nsumption in 2023. However, he increase in prices could \n\nno be offse by he savings in demand, resulting in higher \n\nexpenditures for households.\n\nWe observe significan regional differences in heating energy \n\nconsumption, specifically between he wes and northwes \n\nof Germany, on he one hand, and he eas and south, on \n\nthe other. Once again, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania \n\nconsumed he leas heating energy a 99 kWh per square \n\nmeter. As in he previous year, Saarland was a he other \n\nend of he scale with he highes consumption of 137 kWh \n\nper square meter (Table and Figure 2). Taken ogether, he \n\nwestern German states consumed 121 kWh per square meter, \n\nexceeding he heating energy consumption of heir east­\n\nern German counterparts, which required an average of \n\n111 kWh (Figure 1). A possible explanation for his could be \n\nthe higher retrofi rates for residential buildings in he east­\n\nern German states.9\n\nA he regional level, he differences between he highes \n\nand lowes level of consumption are even more pronounced. \n\nCentral Mecklenburg/Rostock had he lowes average heating \n\nenergy consumption in Germany a 87 kWh per square meter, \n\nfollowed by Western Pomerania a 98 kWh. Eas Fresia, in \n\ncontrast, consumed far more heating energy with 140 kWh \n\nper square meter. The Saar region was in second place with \n\n137 kWh.\n\n7 This corresponds o around six percen of residential buildings in Germany, cf. BDEW (2024): \n\nWie heiz Deutschland 2023?

differences in price changes and \n\nconsumption per square meter\n\nThe median heating energy price for 2023, accounting for \n\nrebates granted under he energy price cap, was 11.81 cents \n\nper kWh. In 2023, Germany saw a 31.4 percen increase over \n\nthe previous year, which was almos as high as he increase \n\nin he firs year after he star of he war on Ukraine, when \n\nenergy prices rose by 33.3 percen (Figure 3). This corre­\n\nsponds o a 75-percen increase in average prices compared \n\nto 2021.\n\nThere are several reasons for his sharp increase in energy \n\nprices despite he price cap. First, he cap applied o gas and \n\ndistric heating only;10 second; he average prices for 2022 \n\nwere far lower han he price cap; and hird, he price cap \n\napplied only o 80 percen of pas consumption. If a house­\n\nhold was only able o reduce its consumption by less han \n\n20 percen compared o 2022 and he new contractual price \n\nwould have been higher han he level of he price cap, he \n\nresulting average price for his household would exceed he \n\nprice cap.\n\nArguably he main reason why heating energy prices con­\n\ntinued o increase in 2023, as compared o 2022, was ha \n\n10 In 2023, here was also an electricity price cap. However, his only impacted heating energy \n\nprices for a very small number of households, as only a very small proportion of buildings in \n\nGermany have electric heating. Since he presen analysis is limited o he hree dominan heat­\n\ning energy sources—gas, oil, and distric heating—the electricity price cap has no effec for he \n\nsample considered.\n\nAnother area where we observe stark differences between \n\nGerman states is in he billed heating prices (Table). Median \n\nheating prices were he lowes in Bremen with 11.08 cents \n\nper kWh, followed by Baden-Wür emberg with 11.15 cents. \n\nIn contrast, Berlin and Brandenburg had he highes heat­\n\ning prices with median prices of 12.87 and 12.80 cents per \n\nkWh, respectively. Regional differences a he more granular \n\nlevel were even more pronounced. Households in Prignitz-\n\nOberhavel and Central Schleswig-Holstein paid 14.60 and \n\n13.93 cents per kWh, making heir median prices he high­\n\nest. Median heating prices in Altmark, Saxony-Anhalt, were \n\nlowes a jus 8.84 cents per kWh, followed by Bodensee-\n\nOberschwaben a 9.03 cents.\n\nBox 2\n\nCalculation of CO₂ emissions\n\nTo calculate a building’s CO2 emissions, he heating energy \n\nconsumption per square meter is multiplied by he emis­\n\nsion factors of each energy carrier (Table). To allow for a \n\n comparison with emissions in he building sector for he \n\nwhole of Germany, only direc CO2 emissions are calculated. \n\nUpstream emissions resulting from energy extraction, rans­\n\nport, and ransformation (for example when generating elec­\n\ntricity and distric heating) are no aken into account.\n\nTo calculate representative average annual CO₂ emissions \n\nper square meter, he annual CO2 emissions per square meter \n\nare weighted for each property according o he share of he \n\nbuilding category in he statistical population. The weighting \n\nis similar o he calculation for emperature-adjusted heating \n\nenergy consumption (Box 1). In other words, he differen build­\n\ning size categories are weighted according o heir share in \n\nthe microcensus.\n\nFigure 3\n\nEnergy prices\n\nWeighted median of natural gas, oil prices, and distric \n\nheating in euro cents per kilowa -hour (lef axis), change \n\nin percen (righ axis)\n\n \n\nSource: ista SE; authors’ own calculations.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nIn he wo years 2022 and 2023, he increase in energy prices adds up \n\nto 75 percent.\n\nTable\n\nCO2 emission factors depending on \n\nenergy carrier\n\nEnergy carrier\n\nCO2 emission factor\n\nNatural gas (H)\n\n0.201\n\nNatural gas (L)\n\n0.201\n\nOil\n\n0.266\n\nHeavy oil\n\n0.293\n\nLignite\n\n0.359\n\nCoke\n\n0.389\n\nHard coal\n\n0.345\n\nLiquified gas\n\n0.236\n\nDistric heating\n\n0\n\nElectricity\n\n0\n\nPellets\n\n0\n\nWood\n\n0\n\nWood chips\n\n0\n\nSource: Umweltbundesam 2014\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\n271\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 45/2024\n\nHEAT MONITOR 2023\n\nsome households did no have o pay he higher energy \n\nprices until 2023. Thanks o he one o wo-year energy price \n\nplans signed up for in advance, hey were no subjec o \n\nprice increases in 2022. The differen contrac structures \n\ntherefore resulted in a significan increase in price variation. \n\nAccordingly, here are households ha came hrough he \n\ncrisis almos unscathed, while others ended up paying very \n\nhigh prices. A he federal state level, Rhineland-Palatinate \n\nsaw he bigges price increase with 45.2 percent, while he \n\nstate of Hamburg recorded he smalles increase with jus \n\n8.8 percen in comparison o he previous year.\n\nThe bigges energy savings in 2023 were recorded in Saxony, \n\nwhich reduced heir heating energy consumption by 5.8 per­\n\ncent. Saarland and Brandenburg, in contrast, saw he small­\n\nes reductions in consumption (2.6 and 2.8 percent, respec­\n\ntively). One of he reasons households did no save more, \n\ndespite he steep price increases, was likely he energy effi­\n\nciency of he buildings, something over which particularly \n\ntenan households generally have no influence. Hence, he \n\nrelation between price increases and reduced heating energy \n\nconsumption is no clear (Figure 4). The fac ha reduced \n\nconsumption canno fully offse hese sharp price increases \n\nis also reflected in he steep rise in overall heating expendi­\n\ntures, with 2023 seeing an increase in heating energy expend­\n\niture of around 24 percen over he previous year (compared \n\nto 2021, he las year before he energy crisis, he increase \n\nwas as high as 54 percent).\n\nPrice and demand structure for distric heating \n\ndiffers noticeably from gas and oil\n\nDistric heating and hea networks have he potential o \n\nmake a significan contribution o he decarbonization of \n\nhea supply: They can be operated with sustainable energy \n\nsources and are more efficien han building-internal gas \n\nand oil-based heating systems. In order o map he poten­\n\ntial switch o sustainable sources in hea generation, his \n\nyear for he firs ime he Hea Monitor’s analysis of heat­\n\ning energy prices covers no jus oil and gas bu also distric \n\nheating. The analysis clearly shows ha he price range for \n\ndistric heating is considerably wider han for gas and oil \n\n(Figure 5). Similarly, he median price of distric heating \n\nper kilowa -hour is, on average, substantially higher han \n\nthose for gas and oil.\n\nTha said, a 97 kWh per square meter, heating consumption \n\nfor distric heating is 24 percen lower han for oil (127 kWh) \n\nand 19 percen lower han for gas (120 kWh) (Figure 6). \n\nDifferences in price and demand for distric heating arise, \n\namong other reasons, from he fac ha hea is supplied \n\ndirectly with distric heating, whereas with gas and heat­\n\ning oil, here are conversion losses due o hea generation \n\nin he house. Another reason for he lower average heating \n\nenergy consumption for distric heating is ha buildings sup­\n\nplied with distric heating have, on average, more residential \n\nunits han buildings, which are heated with gas or oil. These \n\nlarger buildings have less outer walls per square meter of liv­\n\ning space, resulting in lower heating energy requirements.\n\nFigure 4\n\nChange in (temperature-adjusted) heating energy consumption \n\nand heating energy prices in wo and multi-apartmen buildings \n\n(2022–2023) \n\nIn percent\n\n \n\nNote: Billed heating costs are a weighted average of natural gas, oil, and distric heating prices. To calculate he \n\nchanges, only buildings ha could be observed in both 2022 and 2023 are aken into accoun and weighted using he \n\nmicrocensus. For his reason, his figure is no comparable with he able.\n\nSource: ista SE; authors’ own calculations.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nSavings in consumption were no necessarily related o price increases: Households \n\nin Saxony saved he mos on heating energy, even hough prices did no rise ha \n\nmuch here in 2023. \n\n272\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 45/2024\n\nHEAT MONITOR 2023\n\nEmissions reductions losing momentum\n\nLas year, building sector emissions in Germany amounted \n\nto 102 million onnes of CO2 equivalent.11 This is 51 percen \n\nless han in 1990. Nevertheless, for Germany o mee its 2030 \n\nclimate argets, he building sector has o reduce its emis­\n\nsions by 69 percen compared o 1990 levels.\n\nA building’s CO2 emissions depend on multiple factors \n\n(Box 2), in particular its energy efficiency and he heating \n\nsystem used. The emissions per square meter for he wo- \n\nand multi-apartmen buildings examined here continue o \n\nbe on a downward rend (Figure 7). With 19.1 kilos per square \n\nmeter of heated living space, he CO2 emissions a ributed o \n\nheating were eigh percen lower in 2023 han in he previ­\n\nous year. Temperature-adjusted, however, his corresponds \n\nto a 4.3 percen reduction only, as 2023 was a relatively mild \n\nyear. Thus, although he downward rend has continued, he \n\nreduction in emissions was lower in 2023 han he 5.6 per­\n\ncen observed in he previous year (16 percen withou em­\n\nperature adjustment). Given he smaller decrease in heating \n\nenergy consumption, i is no surprising ha emissions lev­\n\nels are no longer falling as dramatically, bu he momentum \n\nin he building sector is still no enough o mee Germany’s \n\nclimate argets.\n\nConclusion: Greater investmen in building \n\nenergy efficiency needed\n\nIn 2023, once again, households faced strong increases in \n\nheating costs compared o he previous year—amounting o \n\n31 percent, on average. Tha being said, here were strong \n\nregional variations. These resulted, on he one hand, from \n\nthe differen ypes of fuel used, as well as from he differ­\n\nen ypes of contracts used by electricity and gas suppliers. \n\nOther importan factors migh be he differen points in \n\ntime a which contracts were concluded or oil anks filled.\n\nThe analysis shows hat, in 2023, he (now expired) energy \n\nprice cap o protec households from potentially extreme \n\nheating cos hikes was indeed effective. For he majority \n\nof households, he uni prices billed were no substantially \n\nhigher han he price cap of 12 cents. When i came o dis­\n\ntric heating, on he other hand, he average price of heat­\n\ning energy was 13 cents per kWh—well above he price cap \n\nof 9.5 cents per kWh. With he price cap only applying o \n\n80 percen of forecasted consumption and anything above \n\nthis being charged a given marke energy prices, 2023 saw \n\na very high average price for distric heating in many places.\n\nDespite similar price increases as in 2022, heating energy \n\nsavings in 2023 were lower han in he previous year. \n\nTemperature-adjusted, private households consumed 3.8 per­\n\ncen less heating energy han in 2022. In he previous year, \n\nthe saving was 5.3 percent. One reason for his migh be ha \n\n11 Umweltbundesamt, “Treibhausgasminderungsziele Deutschlands,” 2024 (in German; \n\navailable online).\n\nFigure 5\n\nHeating energy prices in wo- and multi-apartmen buildings by \n\nenergy source \n\nEuro cents per kilowa -hour\n\n \n\nNote: The shaded areas show he price variance. \n\nSource: ista SE; authors‘ own calculations.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nAverage prices for distric heating are higher han for gas and oil and also show a \n\nstronger variation.\n\nFigure 6\n\nHeating energy consumption in wo- and multi-apartmen \n\nbuildings by energy source \n\nAnnual heating energy consumption in kilowa -hours per square \n\nmeter of heating living space; emperature-adjusted \n\n \n\nSource: ista SE; authors‘ own calculations.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nHeating energy consumption per square meter is significantly lower for distric \n\nheating han for oil and gas.\n\n273\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 45/2024\n\nHEAT MONITOR 2023\n\nin 2023, much less a ention was devoted o saving heating \n\nenergy han in 2022. Another reason migh be ha he poten­\n\ntial o save energy hrough changes in consumer behavior \n\nhad already been exhausted in some households. In some \n\nregions, however, savings were more han wice as high as \n\nthe national average. This indicates ha savings in heating \n\nenergy and herefore also emissions are still possible in he \n\nshor erm – whether hrough behavioral adjustments or \n\nenergy-efficien renovations.\n\nThe months following he energy price crisis of 2022/2023 \n\nsaw he price pressure on he supply side decrease as whole­\n\nsale energy prices dropped and started o stabilize. In he \n\nyears ahead, however, he cos of CO2 emissions from fos­\n\nsil fuels is likely o increase heating costs for private house­\n\nholds. Tha said, he energy price crisis has demonstrated \n\ntha higher heating costs have a limited impac on people’s \n\nheating behavior and herefore also CO2 emissions.\n\nWhen i comes o reducing emissions, he momentum is \n\nthus unlikely o continue unless i is supported by other \n\nmeans. Yet, emissions have o be reduced for he climate ar­\n\ngets in he building sector o be met. The Exper Commission \n\non Gas and Hea has proposed a number of specific meas­\n\nures o achieve hese reductions. The advice and in-kind \n\ncontributions intended o help households reduce heir \n\nheating energy and electricity consumption should here­\n\nfore be strengthened. Even more importantly, however, he \n\n energy-efficien retrofits of inefficien buildings as well as he \n\nswitch o sustainable heating systems such as hea pumps \n\nmus be accelerated. If his is no vigorously pursued, we \n\ncan expec ha heating energy consumption and hus also \n\nemissions in he building sector will rise again in he com­\n\ning years.\n\nFigure 7\n\nDevelopmen of CO₂ emissions in he residential building sector \n\nIn kilograms of CO₂ per square meter of heated living space \n\n \n\nSource: ista SE; authors’ own calculations.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nCO₂ emissions from residential buildings fall steadily, albei a a very slow pace.\n\nJEL: R31, Q21, Q40\n\nKeywords: Heating demand, heating costs, building energy efficiency, residential \n\nbuildings, gas prices\n\nSophie Behr is a research associate in he departmen of Climate Policy of DIW \n\nBerlin | sbehr@diw.de\n\nTill Köveker is a research associate in he departmen of Climate Policy of DIW \n\nBerlin | koeveker@diw.de\n\nMerve Kucuk is a research associate in he departmen of Climate Policy of \n\nDIW Berlin | mkucuk@diw.de"
