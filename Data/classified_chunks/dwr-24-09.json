    "DIW Weekly Repor 9/2024 DOI: h ps://doi.org/10.18723/diw_dwr:2024-9-1 GENDER CARE GAP No lasting increase in he gender care gap in Germany after he coronavirus pandemic By Jonas Jessen, Lavinia Kinne, and Katharina Wrohlich ABSTRACT The gender care gap, i.e., he difference between he amoun of unpaid care work—such as childcare and housework—per­ formed between men and women is comparatively high in Germany: Women ake on much more unpaid care work han men. This gap increases consistently when starting a family. A he beginning of he coronavirus pandemic in 2020, many feared ha he gender care gap may grow even larger. In fact, empirical analyses show ha gender differences in care work did increase in young families a he beginning of he pandemic, as primarily women ook on he extra childcare work brough on by closures of daycare facilities and schools. However, using data from he family panel pairfam, his Weekly Repor shows ha he gender care gap has since returned o its—albei still high—pre-pandemic level. If policymakers wan to effectively comba gender inequalities on he labor market, they should focus more on he unequal division of care work and dismantle existing barriers preventing a more equal divi­ sion. This could be done by, for example, increasing he period of parental leave earmarked o fathers, and reforming minijobs and Ehega enspli ing, i.e., he join axation of married cou­ ples with full income spli ing. International Women’s Day on March 8 is drawing increased a ention o numerous inequalities between women and men. In particular, he gender pay gap, which was 18 per­ cent1 for he fourth ime in a row in 2023 according o cal­ culations by he Federal Statistical Office, is moving into he center of he public debate—no leas hanks o he Equal Pay Day campaign, which falls on March 6 in Germany his year.2 The difference in unpaid care work between women and men, known as he gender care gap, is closely related o he gender pay gap. Care work includes childcare, housework (cooking, cleaning, washing), repairs, and informal care of relatives.3 Countless studies over he years have investigated the gender care gap. 4 Recently, he Federal Statistical Office published data on he gender care gap in Germany mount­ ing o abou 44 percent.5 Considerable increase in gender care gap after becoming a parent Like he gender pay gap, he gender care gap is no he same across all age groups and increases from age 30 in particu­ lar. For employed individuals aged 35 o 39, he gender care gap is over 100 percent. This means ha women in his age 1 The gender pay gap measures he percentage difference between he average gross hourly wages of men and women compared o he average gross hourly wages of men.

An evaluation of data from he family panel pairfam shows the relationship between he birth of he firs child and an increase in he gender care gap (Box 1). When, for example, considering he division of housework (i.e., cooking, clean­ ing, and washing) as par of unpaid care work before and after he birth of a child, here is a sharp decline in he share of couples who divide housework almos equally (“abou 50/50”). Jus under half of couples divide housework roughly equally before he birth of he firs child, bu his share is up o 27 percentage points lower in he years following he birth of he child (Figure 1, right-hand side). In contrast, he share of couples in which “primarily he mother” or “(almost) entirely he mother” handles he housework increases sig­ nificantly (by en and 21 percentage points, respectively). The share of couples indicating ha he mother primarily or (almost) entirely handles childcare is also significantly higher han he share of couples who divide childcare more equally (Figure 1, left-hand side). Only a few couples indi­ cated ha he father akes on a larger share of unpaid care work compared o he mother, both before and after he birth of he firs child. Even more unequal division of care work during the firs months of he pandemic In March 2020, daycare facilities and schools in Germany were closed on shor notice o comba he spread of he corona virus. Parents had",
    "o make up for he lack of school­ ing and childcare options a home o a large extent. A he time, many feared ha mothers would primarily ake on he majority of he additional educational and childcare asks, which would further increase he already large gender care gap in Germany.7 On he other hand, some pointed ou he possibility ha he lack of childcare options could increase fathers’ participation in childcare and hus bring abou a change in social norms in he medium erm.8 Countless empirical studies have examined he division of unpaid care work during he firs months of he coronavi­ rus pandemic. Studies on Germany using various surveys from he firs weeks and months of he pandemic came o the same conclusion: Mothers ook on he majority of he 6 Clara Schäper, Annekatrin Schrenker, and Katharina Wrohlich, “Gender Care Gap and Gen­ der Pay Gap Increase Substantially until Middle Age,” DIW Weekly Repor no. 9 (2023): 99–105 (available online). 7 A return o raditional gender roles is often discussed in his context. Cf. for example Ju a Allmendinger, “Zurück in alte Rollen. Corona bedroh die Geschlechtergerechtigkeit,” WZB-Mi ei­ lungen no. 168 (2020) (in German). 8 Cf. for example Titan Alon e al., “The impac of COVID-19 on gender equality,” NBER Working Paper 26947 (2020); as well as Claudia Hupkau and Barbara Petrongolo, “Work, Care and Gender during he COVID-19 Crisis,” Fiscal Studies 41, no. 3 (2020): 623-651. additional care work.9 A he same ime, however, he data shows ha fathers also spen more ime on childcare han before he pandemic.10 A study from spring and summer 2020 evaluated pairfam data on how couples with a leas one child aged 14 or younger divide housework and childcare duties and also concluded tha his division was somewha more unequal han before the pandemic. While he share of couples dividing child­ care and housework equally remained nearly he same, he share of couples who indicated ha he mother performed (almost) all of hese asks increased. The share of couples in which hese asks were “primarily” performed by he mother decreased accordingly.11 Studies on other countries came o similar results (Box 2). Unequal division of care work declined o pre-pandemic level within one year Empirical studies based on data from winter 2020/2021, nearly a year into he pandemic, concluded ha couples were spli ing unpaid care work essentially he same as hey did before he pandemic (in 2019) (Figure 2).12 The larger share of couples in which he mother “(almost) entirely” ook over childcare and housework in he firs lockdown in 2020 was no longer observed in winter 2020/2021. Division of care work has no changed wo years following he star of he pandemic Pairfam data is now available for he second year follow­ ing he beginning of he coronavirus pandemic. These data include very detailed information on he division of house­ work and childcare between mothers and fathers. They are available for he ime before he pandemic (2019) and can be",
    "compared with hree periods during and after he pan­ demic (spring and summer 2020, winter 2020/2021, and winter 2021/2022). While many families were still affected by pandemic containmen measures such as daycare and school closures in summer 2020 and winter 2020/2021, his was no longer he case in winter 2021/2022.13 The analyses 9 Cf.

In 2019, before he coronavirus pandemic, he majority (59 percent) of respondents indicated ha childcare was provided primarily by he mother. In around 30 percen of cases, childcare was divided evenly. Less han nine percen of respondents indicated ha he mother was (almost) entirely responsible for childcare. In fewer han hree percen of all households in 2019 he father was (almost) entirely or pri­ marily providing childcare.",
    "Very similar pa erns were found for housework. In comparison, he division of childcare and housework in early summer 2020, i.e., during he firs survey after he beginning of he coronavirus pandemic, was more unequal. Particularly noticeable is he decline in he share of couples in which he mother was “primarily” responsible for child­ care and housework. In contrast, he share of couples in which he mother ook on childcare and housework “(almost) entirely” increased by almos he same exten (Figure 2). A detailed analysis of he changes in how couples divide care work shows ha some couples in which he mother was primarily responsible for hese duties before he pan­ demic also had a more equal division during he firs lock­ down (Figure 3). However, some couples who initially had a more equal division switched o a more unequal division in spring/summer 2020 in which primarily he mother ook on childcare and housework. Nine months later, in winter 2020/2021, he share of cou­ ples in which he mother ook care of childcare and house­ work “(almost) entirely” again declined markedly. Couples in which he mothers ook on almos all of he childcare a the beginning of he pandemic now divide childcare more equally. In addition, he share of couples dividing house­ work and childcare roughly equally increased again and was above he 2019 pre-pandemic level. The division of childcare duties remained nearly he same in winter 2021/2022 as well. Thus, he new data from winter 2021/2022 confirm he obser­ vation ha he division of childcare between mothers and fathers—following a brief more unequal division during he firs lockdown in 2020—has no changed significantly fol­ lowing he coronavirus pandemic. A similar picture emerges for housework: Although he share of couples in which he mother was (almost) entirely responsible for housework increased by hree percentage points, hese changes were no statistically significant. Overall, i canno be said with statistical certainty ha here have been any changes com­ pared o before he pandemic for any constellations of house­ work division. Conclusion: Large gender care gap in Germany, bu no lasting increase during he coronavirus pandemic Germany has a relatively large gender care gap compared o, for example, he Nordic countries, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Denmark. This means ha women perform significantly more unpaid care work, such as childcare and housework, compared o men. A he beginning of he coronavirus pan­ demic, many feared ha he related daycare and school clo­ sures could further increase his inequality. And his seemed to be he case, a leas in he shor erm: In spring and early Figure 2 Division of unpaid care work between couples during and around he coronavirus pandemic Shares in percent Note: The vertical black lines each represen a 95 percen confidence interval.

Each year, over 12,000 randomly selected people born between 1971 o 1973, 1981 o 1983, 1991 o 1993, and 2001 o 2003 (since 2019) cohorts participated in he pairfam survey. In the survey, respondents are asked o provide information abou themselves and heir family members, while he family members answer a less extensive survey. An additional survey was conducted in summer 2020 with he purpose of investigating societal changes following he corona- virus pandemic.2 The focus of he survey was on coronavirus-re­ lated changes o family life. All respondents who participated in he previous survey wave, or were only emporarily absent, participated in he additional survey. The regular pairfam survey was continued in he winters of 2020/2021 and 2021/2022. The analyses in his Weekly Repor are mainly based on he las regular survey before he pandemic (2018/2019), he additional corona­ virus pandemic survey, and he wo following survey waves. As gender differences are investigated, he analysis was limited o opposite-gender couples. The data include extensive information on socio-demographic characteristics of he respondents, heir employmen situation, and a itudes oward and details abou relationships. Furthermore, there are questions abou he division of labor in he partnership, the main opic of his Weekly Report. The survey question is: “How are you and your partner currently dividing he ime spen performing work in he following areas?” • Housework (washing, cooking, cleaning) • Shopping • House, apartment, or car repairs • Financial ma ers, dealing with authorities • Childcare [only households with children] Answer options are: • (Almost) entirely my partner • Primarily my partner • Abou 50/50 split • Primarily me • (Almost) entirely me The answers are recoded by gender in order o more directly inter- pre he responses of women and men, each of which make up 1 Cf.

The answers hus range from “the male partner akes over his area (almost) entirely” o “the female partner akes over his area (almost) entirely.” To examine he changes in he division of unpaid care work, he",
    "responses from 2018/2019 are used as a reference period and deviations during and after he coronavirus pandemic are subse­ quently studied. The analyses on he effects of having children on he division of unpaid care work3 are based on all survey waves from 2008 o 2022. The dependen variable, i.e., differen constellations of care work division, is regressed on indicators for he years before and after he birth of he firs child. In addition, age and cohor effects are partialled out. The coefficients displayed hus show how he division of care work has changed relative o he reference period (two years before he birth of he firs child). As no childcare is per­ fomed before he birth of he firs child, he coefficients are natu­ rally se o zero before he birth of he firs child. In contrast, he division of household labor before he birth of he firs child is in­ dicated in he figures. The estimates are based on a otal of 19,665 observations of 5,840 respondents. The sample in he estimation is limited o couples who will either have a child in he following survey years or had a child in he previous waves. In he analysis of he division of care work before, during, and after the coronavirus pandemic,4 opposite-gender couples living o­ gether are observed in he corresponding four survey waves. The sample includes 7,352 observations based on 3,186 respondents. In both samples, 56 o 60 percen of he respondents are women. To depic he division of care work over he four survey waves around he pandemic and how his division changed from survey to survey, he sample is limited o households ha were observed in all four survey waves.5 This way, i can be ensured ha he periods between he surveys can be investigated. The sample includes 2,324 observations and 581 respondents. 3 See Figure 1 in his Weekly Report. 4 See Figure 2 in his report. 5 See Figure 3 in his report. 81 DIW Weekly Repor 9/2024 GENDER CARE GAP summer 2020, inequality in unpaid care work among cou­ ples with children had increased compared o he year before the pandemic. However, his inequality declined back o its pre-pandemic level within he firs year of he pandemic. Recen data from he second year after he beginning of he pandemic confirm his finding. Thus, a major reversal of gender roles did no occur as a resul of he coronavirus pandemic as some had feared. The un equal division of unpaid care work between women and men in Germany did no become more unequal in he medium erm, bu instead remained a a high level. The gender care gap is associated with many gender gaps on he labor market. Gender inequalities increase in unpaid care work as well as on he labor marke when couples have children. If policymakers wan o reduce labor market-re­ lated gender inequalities such as he gender pay gap, hey need o also focus on closing he gender care gap.",
    "Numerous courses of action o create incentives for a more equal divi­ sion of paid and unpaid care work between women and men have been on he able for some ime. Expanding he num­ ber of partner months during parental allowance (Elterngeld), for example, could reduce he considerable inequality in care work following he birth of a child. Furthermore, reforming Ehega enspli ing (join axation of married couples with full income spli ing) and he ax reatmen of mini-job income could reduce he financial “part-time rap” for married women and hus lead o a more equal division of paid work and care work between women and men in he long erm. Figure 3 Change in he division of unpaid care work among couples during and around he coronavirus pandemic Shares in percent Source: Authors’ calculations based on he family panel pairfam. © DIW Berlin 2024 A he beginning of he pandemic, many couples divided care work differently, albei only emporarily. 82 DIW Weekly Repor 9/2024 GENDER CARE GAP Box 2 Impac of he coronavirus pandemic on he division of unpaid care work in an international context Worldwide, women perform considerably more unpaid care work than men, although he size of he gender care gap differs between countries. In some OECD countries, such as South Korea, Japan, Mexico, and Turkey, he gender care gap is similar o he gap in Germany. However, he average gender care gap is smaller in many other European countries.1 Moreover, an especially large in­ crease in he gender care gap can be observed following he birth of a couple’s firs child in Germany compared o other countries.2 The effects of he coronavirus pandemic on he division of unpaid care work have been investigated in many countries. For example, studies from he U.S. show ha couples were dividing care work more equally in 2020 compared o before he pandemic. However, here oo here is an increased burden on mothers compared o fathers in erms of educating heir children and contempora­ neously managing both paid work and childcare. This burden occurred primarily due o daycare and school closures and could be observed in particular for parents with a low level of education and low income.3 This also resulted in differences in well-being between mothers and women withou children: Mothers with young children (up o and including primary school age) reported a greater psychological burden during he pandemic.4 1 OECD, Dare o Share – Deutschlands Weg zur Partnerschaftlichkei in Familie und Beruf ( Paris: 2017) (in German); Jacques Charmes, The Unpaid Care Work and he Labour Market.
