    "men. This difference, known as he gender care gap, varies considerably between European countries, with Germany somewhere in he middle of he distribution. This Weekly Repor analyzes he institutional, societal, and labor marke factors ha are related o he gender care gap across European countries. The results show ha he gap is smaller in countries ha spend more on he formal care system. In addition, hey show ha he gender care gap ends to be larger in countries ha exhibi high gender inequality and high inequality in labor marke participation between men and women. Thus, he results emphasize ha he gender pay gap correlates with governmen investments in health care, he care system, and he labor marke structure. To reduce he gender care gap, expenditure on formal care should be increased o relieve informal caregivers and improve he quality of care in professional facilities. A he same ime, policymakers should use ax and family policy incentives o increase women’s workforce participation so ha paid work and care work are more evenly distributed. One of he key future social and health policy challenges is the increasing amoun of people requiring care as society ages. Currently, around five million people receive benefits from long-term care insurance in Germany and according to curren estimates, his figure will increase over he com­ ing decades.1 The majority of people requiring care receive care a home (83 percent). Nearly 14 percen of his majority belong o Pflegegrad I (long-term care level I, “minor restric­ tion of independence”) and only receive minimal additional benefits from long-term care insurance. Around 60 percen of people receiving care a home only receive a care allow­ ance (Pflegegeld), meaning hey organize informal care with­ ou professional assistance.2 The other 25 percen of people requiring care in heir own home organize heir care with he help of outpatien nursing and care services, which usually also includes informal care provided by relatives. Informal care, especially withou professional help, is ime consuming and frequently results in he caretaking rela­ tives reducing or giving up paid employmen or ending heir search for paid employment. Like childcare, i is mainly women who provide informal care, interrupting heir careers to do so.3 The difference between he amoun of informal care work performed by men and women is known as he gender care gap in long-term care.4 In his Weekly Report, the shortened erm gender care gap is used.5 1 In a curren estimate, he Federal Statistical Office reports ha he number of people receiving benefits will increase o 6.8 million by 2055 if prevalence rates remain he same. If he prevalence rates continue o rend upward, he number will be much higher.

For more, see he DIW Berlin Glossary (in Ger­ man; available online). 5 The large share of women performing care work is reflected in he formal care sector as well. According o OECD evaluations, he average share of women working in professional long-term care in OECD countries is around 90 percent. This frequently includes jobs with poor working con­ ditions and comparatively low wages (OECD, “Women are well-represented in health and long- term care professions, bu often in jobs with poor working conditions,” (2019) (available online)). 57 DIW Weekly Repor 7/2024 GENDER CARE GAP The gender care gap is a significan factor contributing o employmen and income inequality between men and wom­ en.6 This does no only apply o curren income possibilities, bu also o he amoun of future pension entitlements, as hey directly depend on how much remuneration subjec o pen­ sion insurance a person has earned.7 The differences in pen­ sion entitlements between women and men are often linked to gender differences in employmen histories.8 The above-average number of women caring for relatives is often explained by labor marke differences between he gen­ ders: Women frequently earn less and work fewer hours han their partner, so reducing heir hours or qui ing heir job to perform caretaking duties reduces he household income less han if heir partner were o work fewer hours or quit. Social norms ha regard care work as women’s work also contribute o he gap. Moreover, he underlying care system may be reinforcing he differences in informal care provided by women and men. For example, a strong welfare state ha spends a significan amoun on formal care offers, such as outpatien care services, adul daycare, or in-patien nursing homes, can mitigate gender differences in informal care, as generally less informal care is needed. This Weekly Repor investigates how he gender care gap in Germany differs from he gap in other European countries.9 I also shows how he gender care gap correlates with govern­ men spending on care as well as with he societal and labor marke inequality between men and women. The analysis uses data from he Survey of Health, Ageing and Retiremen in Europe (SHARE), which includes people aged 50 or older in 17 European countries. In addition o key socio-demo­ graphic indicators, he data contains detailed information on informal care provided (Box on data and sample).10 Women perform more care work han men in all countries analyzed This Weekly Repor only considers informal care work per­ formed for someone outside of one’s own household—such as help with ge ing dressed, bathing or showering, eating meals, ge ing in or ou of bed, or using he oilet—when cal­ culating he gender care gap. Caretaking duties performed for one’s partner in one’s",
    "own household are no considered here. The absolute difference between he shares of men and women acting as informal caregivers is adjusted for age 6 Clara Schäper, Annekatrin Schrenker, and Katharina Wrohlich, “Gender Care Gap and Gender Pay Gap Increase Substantially until Middle Age,” DIW Weekly Report, no. 9 (2023): 83–88 ( available online; accessed on January 30, 2024). 7 Informal care provided by caregivers who have no ye fully retired is now credited with pension entitlements and hese periods also coun as compulsory insurance periods.

Although he gender care gap differs between countries, a clear rend emerges: In all countries, women perform more informal care work han men (Figure 1). The gap is small­ es in Portugal, Switzerland, and Sweden, where i is around 60 o 90 percent. This means ha women are 60 o 90 per­ cen more likely han men o provide care, i.e., slightly less than wice as often. The adjusted relative gender care gap is 200 percen or higher in he countries with he highes gaps, Luxembourg, Greece, and Croatia. Here, he share of women caregivers is hree imes as high as he share of men caregivers. The gender care gap is 133 percen in Germany, meaning women are wice as likely o care for relatives as men. Thus, Germany is in he middle of he distribution of the countries observed here. Mos countries also have distinc gender differences in regard o he regularity and frequency with which men and 11 This refers o he age and level of education of he caregiver. The results of his Weekly Repor are similar o analyses in which he difference between women and men is no adjusted for age and level of education.

In many countries, women are significantly more likely o provide daily care than men. In Portugal, Greece, and Denmark, women are around hree imes as likely as men o provide care on a daily basis. The considerable gender differences in hese countries are often also eviden in erms of weekly care. The share of women and men who provide care on a daily basis is abou the same in only a few countries, such as Sweden, France, or Poland. However, gender differences in weekly care are often significantly higher in hese countries, resulting in a positive gender care gap (see Figure 1). In Germany, women are around wice as likely as men o provide care on a daily basis and around hree imes as likely o provide care on a weekly basis. The care system influences he gender care gap Taking a closer look, systematic regional differences are noticeable: While informal care is performed less fre­ quently overall in Northern and Eastern European coun­ tries (Figure 2, left), i is performed more frequently overall in Southern and Western European countries (Figure 2, center and right), where he gender care gap is often larger. In he countries where a lo of informal care is provided, women are frequently performing he care work. This suggests ha women perform a large share of private, informal care work. Germany is in he middle of he distribution here as well. To capture country-specific differences in he care systems, this Weekly Repor considers he respective expenditure on long-term care, both overall as well as on in-patien care in professional facilities (Table in Box). Higher proportional expenditure on care is interpreted as an indicator of a bet­ ter care system. In particular, expenditure on inpatien care indicates a pronounced formal care sector ha can relieve caregiving relatives. Countries with higher care expenditure have lower gender care gaps The results of he analysis (Figure 3) show ha he gen­ der care gap is smaller in countries ha spend more over­ all on formal long-term care, such as Sweden, Belgium, or Switzerland. In contrast, countries with comparatively larger gender care gaps, such as Croatia or Greece, spend less on long-term care. Germany is again in he middle in both dimensions. This correlation becomes even more clear when only viewing expenditure on long-term in-patien care instead of otal expenditure on long-term care. While nearly two percen of GDP is spen on in-patien care in Sweden and Switzerland, Greece and Croatia spend only 0.07 and 0.15 per­ cen each. Germany spends around one percen of its GDP on long-term in-patien care, again landing i in",
    "he middle of he distribution compared o other European countries. When comparing he differences in in-patien care expend­ iture o he gender care gaps in he respective countries, a clear, statistically significan negative correlation emerges: On average, smaller gender differences in privately provided informal care can be observed in countries with more expend­ iture on long-term in-patien care (Figure 4). A he coun­ try level, his resul reflects he fac ha a stronger formal care system relieves caregiving relatives, especially women. However, i is questionable if his contributes o general gender equality, as here is a large share of women working in he professional care sector, where careers are frequently comparatively low paid.12 Gender care cap is lower when gender inequality is low The Gender Inequality Index (GEI) is used o investigate he correlation between he gender care cap and general gender inequality in he countries analyzed (Table in Box). The GEI includes differen domains of inequality ha are summarized into a single index between 1 (total inequality) and 100 (total equality). The results show ha he gender care gap is smaller in countries with higher gender equality across he differen domains (Figure 5).13 This correlation is clear in countries 12 OECD, “Women are well-represented in health and long-term care professions.” 13 This negative difference is no statistically significant, which could also be related o he small number of countries. The Gender Equality Index is available for all countries in Figure 1 excep for Switzerland, bringing he otal number of countries o 16.

This fac correlates positively with care work: The larger he relative difference in he employmen rate between men and women, he larger he gender care gap. This cor­ relation is especially clear when looking a Greece, Sweden, Portugal, and Switzerland. In Greece, he gender employ­ men rate gap is 30 percent. A he same ime, women in Greece are hree imes as likely as men o perform informal care work, which is a gender care gap of nearly 200 percent. In contrast, women are less han wice as likely o perform care work as men—a gender care gap of less han 100 per­ cent—in Sweden, Portugal, and Switzerland, where he dif­",
    "ference in he employmen rate is a maximum of 11 percent. Again, Germany is in he middle of he distribution here: The relative gender difference in he employmen rate is around en percen with a gender care gap of around 133 per­ cent. These results confirm, as expected, ha gender dif­ ferences in he labor marke are reflected in gender differ­ ences in informal care work and ha hese wo factors can be mutually dependent. such as Croatia, Greece, and Estonia: Each country’s GEI is around 50, which indicates high gender inequality com­ pared o he other countries. In hese hree countries, he gender care gap is over 170 percent. The counterexample is Sweden: I has he highes GEI (83) ogether with he hird smalles gender care gap (88 percent). Germany, again, is in the middle of he distribution with a GEI of 66 and a gen­ der care gap of around 133 percent. However, here are also exceptions o his correlation. For example, Portugal has a smaller gender pay gap bu a lower Gender Equality Index. Such exceptions show ha inequality in informal caretak­ ing duties between men and women can also be driven by other factors ha are no included in he GEI (Table in Box). One other importan gender difference is employmen rate inequality. The correlation between he gender care gap and differences in employmen pa erns between men and women are hus illustrated separately (Figure 6). Women’s labor marke participation depends on informal care work The lower he number of women employed in a country, the larger he gender care gap. A positive difference in he employmen rate means ha he labor marke participation Figure 4 Adjusted gender care gap and relative long-term in-patien care expenditure Gender Care Gap in percent, expenditure in percen of GDP Note: The line shown indicates he correlation between he adjusted gender care gap and relative expenditure on long-term care (measured as a percentage of GDP) based on a regression analysis.

However, here are importan differences between he countries ha are related o both expenditure on he formal care system and gender inequal­ ity: The more spen on formal care, he smaller he gender care gap, and countries with low gender inequality have a small gender care gap. Germany can learn from its neighbors with lower gender care gaps: In an international comparison, i is in he mid­ dle of he distribution when i comes o expenditure on for­ mal care, gender inequality, and he gender care gap. Germany should inves more in formal care o increase the number and quality of care offers as well as o reduce the amoun of informal care ha relatives mus provide. Currently, baby boomers are providing mos informal care. This will change in he future and in he medium erm when baby boomers stop acting as caregivers and begin requir­ ing care hemselves. Irrespective of he specific care work Box Data and sampling This Weekly Repor is based on Wave 6 (survey year 2015) of he Survey of Health, Ageing and Retiremen in Europe (SHARE).1 The sample is limited o respondents of a leas 50 years of age.2 This is done in order o investigate long-term care for adults and to distinguish i from childcare. Definition of care work In his study, only personal care (e.g., help with ge ing dressed, bathing or showering, eating meals, ge ing in or ou of bed, using the oilet) provided outside a person’s household and within he las welve months prior o he survey is considered care work. Care work provided within one’s own household is no considered as care work here, as both forms are captured differently in he data and are hus no comparable.3 Care provided by partners liv­ ing in he household is herefore no included. Other ypes of help provided for relatives or acquaintances, such as assistance with gardening or administrative ma ers, are no captured. On he one hand, his delineation clearly defines care as personal care suppor for another person and, on he other, ensures comparability with formal care services, such as care provided by an outpatien care service. The gender care gap is often calculated in he literature based on he number of hours spen caring for relatives daily.4 The underlying database does no contain any information on he daily use of ime (hours) spen on providing personal care. This Weekly Repor herefore measures whether he responden states ha they provide personal care for relatives (outside heir household). The SHARE data also records whether personal care is provided daily, weekly, or less frequently.",

This Weekly Repor uses data from he survey year 2015 because he following survey years are no suited for his repor due o methodological reasons. 2 Around 98 percen of he respondents in SHARE (Wave 6) are 50 or older. 3 Care work provided outside he household includes assistance with personal care within the las 12 months regardless of frequency, while care work provided in one’s own household only includes care on a regular basis (daily or almos daily over he las hree month). 4 Nina Klünder, Differenzierte Ermi lung des Gender Care Gap auf Basis der repräsentativen Zeit­ verwendungsdaten 2012/13 (Berlin: Institu für Sozialarbei und Sozialpädagogik e.

Methodology The gender care gap describes he relative difference in he shares of women and of men providing informal care. In he firs step, country-specific, cross-sectionally weighted regressions are used to calculate he absolute differences in he shares of men and women providing informal care, controlling for age and he level of education. These are hen divided by he country-specific, weight­ ed share of all men providing care in order o calculate he relative gender care gap. The larger his gender care gap, he greater he gender inequality in he provision of informal care. In he second step, his relative gender care gap is regressed in­ dividually on he various country characteristics o investigate the respective statistical correlations between he gender care gap and various indicators of he national labor marke and care sys­ tem (Table in Box). As with he SHARE data, information from 2015 is used for he indicators.

    "care system. One curren issue is he growing short­ age of skilled workers in he formal care sector. According o Federal Statistical Office projections, he expected number of care workers in 2049 will be a leas 280,000 fewer han the expected demand.14 A shortage of skilled workers causes the quality of care provided o suffer. Sufficien personnel a care facilities is also a condition for relieving informal care- givers and hus decreasing he gender care gap. I is importan o mobilize more men for informal care o reduce inequality in care work. However, his is likely a very long-term goal, as can also be seen, for example, with paren­ tal benefits (Elterngeld), where resounding success in increas­ ing parity in childcare has still no occurred. For more equal­ ity in long-term care, i is crucial o reduce labor marke inequality between men and women. There are prominen proposals for achieving his goal, for example reforming Ehega enspli ing (join axation of married couples with full income spli ing) or improving childcare so ha both par­ ents can work full ime. These instruments could be con­ ducive o he long-term goal of equal division of paid work and care work between men and women. 14 Statistisches Bundesamt, “Bis 2049 werden voraussichtlich mindestens 280,000 zusätzliche Pflegekräfte benötigt” press release from January 24, 2024 (in German; available online; accessed on January 30, 2024).
