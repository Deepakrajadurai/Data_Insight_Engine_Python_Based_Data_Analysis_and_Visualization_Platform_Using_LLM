This gap increases consistently when starting a family. \n\nAt the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, many \n\nfeared that the gender care gap may grow even larger. In \n\nfact, empirical analyses show that gender differences in care \n\nwork did increase in young families at the beginning of the \n\npandemic, as primarily women took on the extra childcare \n\nwork brought on by closures of daycare facilities and schools. \n\nHowever, using data from the family panel pairfam, this Weekly \n\nReport shows that the gender care gap has since returned to \n\nits—albeit still high—pre-pandemic level. If policymakers want \n\nto effectively combat gender inequalities on the labor market, \n\nthey should focus more on the unequal division of care work \n\nand dismantle existing barriers preventing a more equal divi­\n\nsion. This could be done by, for example, increasing the period \n\nof parental leave earmarked to fathers, and reforming minijobs \n\nand Ehegattensplitting, i.e., the joint taxation of married cou­\n\nples with full income splitting.\n\nInternational Women’s Day on March 8 is drawing increased \n\nattention to numerous inequalities between women and \n\nmen. In particular, the gender pay gap, which was 18 per­\n\ncent1 for the fourth time in a row in 2023 according to cal­\n\nculations by the Federal Statistical Office, is moving into the \n\ncenter of the public debate—not least thanks to the Equal Pay \n\nDay campaign, which falls on March 6 in Germany this year.2\n\nThe difference in unpaid care work between women and \n\nmen, known as the gender care gap, is closely related to the \n\ngender pay gap. Care work includes childcare, housework \n\n(cooking, cleaning, washing), repairs, and informal care of \n\nrelatives.3 Countless studies over the years have investigated \n\nthe gender care gap. 4 Recently, the Federal Statistical Office \n\npublished data on the gender care gap in Germany mount­\n\ning to about 44 percent.5\n\nConsiderable increase in gender care gap after \n\nbecoming a parent\n\nLike the gender pay gap, the gender care gap is not the same \n\nacross all age groups and increases from age 30 in particu­\n\nlar. For employed individuals aged 35 to 39, the gender care \n\ngap is over 100 percent. This means that women in this age \n\n1 \n\nThe gender pay gap measures the percentage difference between the average gross hourly \n\nwages of men and women compared to the average gross hourly wages of men. For more informa­\n\ntion, see the entry on the gender care gap in the DIW Berlin Glossary (in German; available  online). \n\nFor the current gender pay gap, see Statistisches Bundesamt, “Gender Pay Gap 2023:  Frauen \n\nverdienten pro Stunde 18 Prozent weniger als Männer,” press release no. 027 from January 18, \n\n2024 (in German; available online. Accessed on February 16, 2024. This applies to all other online \n\n sources in this report unless stated otherwise).\n\n2 Equal Pay Day began in the United States and was observed for the first time in Germany in \n\n2007. It represents the day each year until which women essentially work unpaid. In 2024, Equal \n\nPay Day is on March 6 (18 percent of 366 days is 66 days). For more information, see the Equal Pay \n\nDay website (available online).\n\n3 For more information, see the entry on the gender care gap in the DIW Berlin Glossary (in Ger­\n\nman; available online).\n\n4 Nina Klünder, Differenzierte Ermittlung des Gender Care Gap auf Basis der repräsentativen \n\nZeitverwendungsdaten 2012/13 (Berlin: Institut für Sozialarbeit und Sozialpädagogik e.V., 2017) (in \n\nGerman; available online); and Claire Samtleben, “Also on Sundays, Women Perform Most of the \n\nHousework and Child Care,” DIW Weekly Report no. 10 (2019): 86-92 (available online).\n\n5 Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth (BMFSFJ), “Statistisches \n\nBundesamt veröffentlicht neue Zahlen zum Gender Care Gap,” latest news, February 28, 2024, \n\n(available online).\n\n77\n\nDIW Weekly Report 9/2024\n\nGENDER CARE GAP\n\ngroup take on twice as much unpaid care work as men.6 How \n\nthe gender care gap develops over the life course is closely \n\nrelated to having children, which not only leads to a large \n\nincrease in care work overall but also to a considerable \n\nincrease in the unequal division of care work.\n\nAn evaluation of data from the family panel pairfam shows \n\nthe relationship between the birth of the first child and an \n\nincrease in the gender care gap (Box 1). When, for example, \n\nconsidering the division of housework (i.e., cooking, clean­\n\ning, and washing) as part of unpaid care work before and \n\nafter the birth of a child, there is a sharp decline in the share \n\nof couples who divide housework almost equally (“about \n\n50/50”). Just under half of couples divide housework roughly \n\nequally before the birth of the first child, but this share is \n\nup to 27 percentage points lower in the years following the \n\nbirth of the child (Figure 1, right-hand side). In contrast, the \n\nshare of couples in which “primarily the mother” or “(almost) \n\nentirely the mother” handles the housework increases sig­\n\nnificantly (by ten and 21 percentage points, respectively).\n\nThe share of couples indicating that the mother primarily \n\nor (almost) entirely handles childcare is also significantly \n\nhigher than the share of couples who divide childcare more \n\nequally (Figure 1, left-hand side). Only a few couples indi­\n\ncated that the father takes on a larger share of unpaid care \n\nwork compared to the mother, both before and after the birth \n\nof the first child.\n\nEven more unequal division of care work during \n\nthe first months of the pandemic\n\nIn March 2020, daycare facilities and schools in Germany \n\nwere closed on short notice to combat the spread of the \n\ncorona virus. Parents had to make up for the lack of school­\n\ning and childcare options at home to a large extent. At the \n\ntime, many feared that mothers would primarily take on the \n\nmajority of the additional educational and childcare tasks, \n\nwhich would further increase the already large gender care \n\ngap in Germany.7 On the other hand, some pointed out the \n\npossibility that the lack of childcare options could increase \n\nfathers’ participation in childcare and thus bring about a \n\nchange in social norms in the medium term.8\n\nCountless empirical studies have examined the division of \n\nunpaid care work during the first months of the coronavi­\n\nrus pandemic. Studies on Germany using various surveys \n\nfrom the first weeks and months of the pandemic came to \n\nthe same conclusion: Mothers took on the majority of the \n\n6 Clara Schäper, Annekatrin Schrenker, and Katharina Wrohlich, “Gender Care Gap and Gen­\n\nder Pay Gap Increase Substantially until Middle Age,” DIW Weekly Report no. 9 (2023): 99–105 \n\n(available online).\n\n7 A return to traditional gender roles is often discussed in this context.

While the share of couples dividing child­\n\ncare and housework equally remained nearly the same, the \n\nshare of couples who indicated that the mother performed \n\n(almost) all of these tasks increased. The share of couples in \n\nwhich these tasks were “primarily” performed by the mother \n\ndecreased accordingly.11 Studies on other countries came to \n\nsimilar results (Box 2).\n\nUnequal division of care work declined to \n\npre-pandemic level within one year\n\nEmpirical studies based on data from winter 2020/2021, \n\nnearly a year into the pandemic, concluded that couples were \n\nsplitting unpaid care work essentially the same as they did \n\nbefore the pandemic (in 2019) (Figure 2).12 The larger share \n\nof couples in which the mother “(almost) entirely” took over \n\nchildcare and housework in the first lockdown in 2020 was \n\nno longer observed in winter 2020/2021.\n\nDivision of care work has not changed two years \n\nfollowing the start of the pandemic\n\nPairfam data is now available for the second year follow­\n\ning the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. These data \n\ninclude very detailed information on the division of house­\n\nwork and childcare between mothers and fathers. They are \n\navailable for the time before the pandemic (2019) and can \n\nbe compared with three periods during and after the pan­\n\ndemic (spring and summer 2020, winter 2020/2021, and \n\nwinter 2021/2022). While many families were still affected \n\nby pandemic containment measures such as daycare and \n\nschool closures in summer 2020 and winter 2020/2021, this \n\nwas no longer the case in winter 2021/2022.13 The analyses \n\n9 Cf.

In around 30 percent of \n\ncases, childcare was divided evenly. Less than nine percent of \n\nrespondents indicated that the mother was (almost) entirely \n\nresponsible for childcare. In fewer than three percent of all \n\nhouseholds in 2019 the father was (almost) entirely or pri­\n\nmarily providing childcare. Very similar patterns were found \n\nfor housework.\n\nIn comparison, the division of childcare and housework \n\nin early summer 2020, i.e., during the first survey after the \n\nbeginning of the coronavirus pandemic, was more unequal. \n\nParticularly noticeable is the decline in the share of couples \n\nin which the mother was “primarily” responsible for child­\n\ncare and housework. In contrast, the share of couples in \n\nwhich the mother took on childcare and housework “(almost) \n\nentirely” increased by almost the same extent (Figure 2). \n\nA detailed analysis of the changes in how couples divide \n\ncare work shows that some couples in which the mother \n\nwas primarily responsible for these duties before the pan­\n\ndemic also had a more equal division during the first lock­\n\ndown (Figure 3). However, some couples who initially had \n\na more equal division switched to a more unequal division \n\nin spring/summer 2020 in which primarily the mother took \n\non childcare and housework.\n\nNine months later, in winter 2020/2021, the share of cou­\n\nples in which the mother took care of childcare and house­\n\nwork “(almost) entirely” again declined markedly. Couples \n\nin which the mothers took on almost all of the childcare at \n\nthe beginning of the pandemic now divide childcare more \n\nequally. In addition, the share of couples dividing house­\n\nwork and childcare roughly equally increased again and was \n\nabove the 2019 pre-pandemic level. The division of childcare \n\nduties remained nearly the same in winter 2021/2022 as well.\n\nThus, the new data from winter 2021/2022 confirm the obser­\n\nvation that the division of childcare between mothers and \n\nfathers—following a brief more unequal division during the \n\nfirst lockdown in 2020—has not changed significantly fol­\n\nlowing the coronavirus pandemic. A similar picture emerges \n\nfor housework: Although the share of couples in which the \n\nmother was (almost) entirely responsible for housework \n\nincreased by three percentage points, these changes were \n\nnot statistically significant. Overall, it cannot be said with \n\nstatistical certainty that there have been any changes com­\n\npared to before the pandemic for any constellations of house­\n\nwork division.\n\nConclusion: Large gender care gap in \n\nGermany, but no lasting increase during the \n\ncoronavirus pandemic\n\nGermany has a relatively large gender care gap compared to, \n\nfor example, the Nordic countries, Sweden, Norway, Finland, \n\nand Denmark. This means that women perform significantly \n\nmore unpaid care work, such as childcare and housework, \n\ncompared to men. At the beginning of the coronavirus pan­\n\ndemic, many feared that the related daycare and school clo­\n\nsures could further increase this inequality. And this seemed \n\nto be the case, at least in the short term: In spring and early \n\nFigure 2\n\nDivision of unpaid care work between couples during and \n\naround the coronavirus pandemic\n\nShares in percent\n\n \n\nNote: The vertical black lines each represent a 95 percent confidence interval.

Each year, over 12,000 randomly selected people \n\nborn between 1971 to 1973, 1981 to 1983, 1991 to 1993, and 2001 to \n\n2003 (since 2019) cohorts participated in the pairfam survey. In \n\nthe survey, respondents are asked to provide information about \n\nthemselves and their family members, while the family members \n\nanswer a less extensive survey.\n\nAn additional survey was conducted in summer 2020 with the \n\npurpose of investigating societal changes following the corona-\n\nvirus pandemic.2 The focus of the survey was on coronavirus-re­\n\nlated changes to family life. All respondents who participated \n\nin the previous survey wave, or were only temporarily absent, \n\nparticipated in the additional survey. The regular pairfam survey \n\nwas continued in the winters of 2020/2021 and 2021/2022. The \n\nanalyses in this Weekly Report are mainly based on the last regular \n\nsurvey before the pandemic (2018/2019), the additional corona­\n\nvirus pandemic survey, and the two following survey waves. As \n\ngender differences are investigated, the analysis was limited to \n\nopposite-gender couples.\n\nThe data include extensive information on socio-demographic \n\ncharacteristics of the respondents, their employment situation, \n\nand attitudes toward and details about relationships. Furthermore, \n\nthere are questions about the division of labor in the partnership, \n\nthe main topic of this Weekly Report. The survey question is:\n\n“How are you and your partner currently dividing the time spent \n\nperforming work in the following areas?”\n\n• \n\nHousework (washing, cooking, cleaning)\n\n• \n\nShopping\n\n• \n\nHouse, apartment, or car repairs\n\n• \n\nFinancial matters, dealing with authorities\n\n• \n\nChildcare [only households with children]\n\nAnswer options are:\n\n• \n\n(Almost) entirely my partner\n\n• \n\nPrimarily my partner\n\n• \n\nAbout 50/50 split\n\n• \n\nPrimarily me\n\n• \n\n(Almost) entirely me\n\nThe answers are recoded by gender in order to more directly inter-\n\npret the responses of women and men, each of which make up \n\n1 \n\nCf.

Sabine Walper et al., “The pairfam COVID-19 survey: Design and instruments. Release \n\nVersion,” pairfam Technical Paper 15 (LMU Munich: 2020) and Sabine Walper et al., “The pairfam \n\n COVID-19 survey,” (Cologne: GESIS Data, Version 1.0.0) (available online).\n\nabout half of the respondents. The answers thus range from “the \n\nmale partner takes over this area (almost) entirely” to “the female \n\npartner takes over this area (almost) entirely.”\n\nTo examine the changes in the division of unpaid care work, the \n\nresponses from 2018/2019 are used as a reference period and \n\ndeviations during and after the coronavirus pandemic are subse­\n\nquently studied.\n\nThe analyses on the effects of having children on the division of \n\nunpaid care work3 are based on all survey waves from 2008 to \n\n2022. The dependent variable, i.e., different constellations of care \n\nwork division, is regressed on indicators for the years before and \n\nafter the birth of the first child. In addition, age and cohort effects \n\nare partialled out. The coefficients displayed thus show how the \n\ndivision of care work has changed relative to the reference period \n\n(two years before the birth of the first child). As no childcare is per­\n\nfomed before the birth of the first child, the coefficients are natu­\n\nrally set to zero before the birth of the first child. In contrast, the \n\ndivision of household labor before the birth of the first child is in­\n\ndicated in the figures. The estimates are based on a total of 19,665 \n\nobservations of 5,840 respondents. The sample in the estimation \n\nis limited to couples who will either have a child in the following \n\nsurvey years or had a child in the previous waves.\n\nIn the analysis of the division of care work before, during, and after \n\nthe coronavirus pandemic,4 opposite-gender couples living to­\n\ngether are observed in the corresponding four survey waves. The \n\nsample includes 7,352 observations based on 3,186 respondents. \n\nIn both samples, 56 to 60 percent of the respondents are women.\n\nTo depict the division of care work over the four survey waves \n\naround the pandemic and how this division changed from survey \n\nto survey, the sample is limited to households that were observed \n\nin all four survey waves.5 This way, it can be ensured that the \n\n periods between the surveys can be investigated. The sample \n\nincludes 2,324 observations and 581 respondents.\n\n3 See Figure 1 in this Weekly Report.\n\n4 See Figure 2 in this report.\n\n5 See Figure 3 in this report.\n\n81\n\nDIW Weekly Report 9/2024\n\nGENDER CARE GAP\n\nsummer 2020, inequality in unpaid care work among cou­\n\nples with children had increased compared to the year before \n\nthe pandemic. However, this inequality declined back to its \n\npre-pandemic level within the first year of the pandemic. \n\nRecent data from the second year after the beginning of the \n\npandemic confirm this finding.\n\nThus, a major reversal of gender roles did not occur as a \n\nresult of the coronavirus pandemic as some had feared. \n\nThe un equal division of unpaid care work between women \n\nand men in Germany did not become more unequal in the \n\nmedium term, but instead remained at a high level.\n\nThe gender care gap is associated with many gender gaps \n\non the labor market. Gender inequalities increase in unpaid \n\ncare work as well as on the labor market when couples have \n\nchildren. If policymakers want to reduce labor market-re­\n\nlated gender inequalities such as the gender pay gap, they \n\nneed to also focus on closing the gender care gap. Numerous \n\ncourses of action to create incentives for a more equal divi­\n\nsion of paid and unpaid care work between women and men \n\nhave been on the table for some time. Expanding the num­\n\nber of partner months during parental allowance (Elterngeld), \n\nfor example, could reduce the considerable inequality in care \n\nwork following the birth of a child. Furthermore, reforming \n\nEhegattensplitting (joint taxation of married couples with full \n\nincome splitting) and the tax treatment of mini-job income \n\ncould reduce the financial “part-time trap” for married \n\nwomen and thus lead to a more equal division of paid work \n\nand care work between women and men in the long term.\n\nFigure 3\n\nChange in the division of unpaid care work among couples \n\nduring and around the coronavirus pandemic\n\nShares in percent\n\n \n\nSource: Authors’ calculations based on the family panel pairfam.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nAt the beginning of the pandemic, many couples divided care work differently, albeit \n\nonly temporarily.\n\n82\n\nDIW Weekly Report 9/2024\n\nGENDER CARE GAP\n\nBox 2\n\nImpact of the coronavirus pandemic on the division of unpaid care work in an international context\n\nWorldwide, women perform considerably more unpaid care work \n\nthan men, although the size of the gender care gap differs between \n\ncountries. In some OECD countries, such as South Korea, Japan, \n\nMexico, and Turkey, the gender care gap is similar to the gap in \n\nGermany. However, the average gender care gap is smaller in \n\nmany other European countries.1 Moreover, an especially large in­\n\ncrease in the gender care gap can be observed following the birth \n\nof a couple’s first child in Germany compared to other countries.2\n\nThe effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the division of unpaid \n\ncare work have been investigated in many countries. For example, \n\nstudies from the U.S. show that couples were dividing care work \n\nmore equally in 2020 compared to before the pandemic. However, \n\nhere too there is an increased burden on mothers compared to \n\n fathers in terms of educating their children and contempora­\n\nneously managing both paid work and childcare. This burden \n\noccurred primarily due to daycare and school closures and could \n\nbe observed in particular for parents with a low level of education \n\nand low income.3 This also resulted in differences in well-being \n\nbetween mothers and women without children: Mothers with \n\nyoung children (up to and including primary school age) reported \n\na greater psychological burden during the pandemic.4\n\n1 \n\nOECD, Dare to Share – Deutschlands Weg zur Partnerschaftlichkeit in Familie und Beruf ( Paris: \n\n2017) (in German); Jacques Charmes, The Unpaid Care Work and the Labour Market.

This gap increases consistently when starting a family. \n\nA he beginning of he coronavirus pandemic in 2020, many \n\nfeared ha he gender care gap may grow even larger. In \n\nfact, empirical analyses show ha gender differences in care \n\nwork did increase in young families a he beginning of he \n\npandemic, as primarily women ook on he extra childcare \n\nwork brough on by closures of daycare facilities and schools. \n\nHowever, using data from he family panel pairfam, his Weekly \n\nRepor shows ha he gender care gap has since returned o \n\nits—albei still high—pre-pandemic level. If policymakers wan \n\nto effectively comba gender inequalities on he labor market, \n\nthey should focus more on he unequal division of care work \n\nand dismantle existing barriers preventing a more equal divi­\n\nsion. This could be done by, for example, increasing he period \n\nof parental leave earmarked o fathers, and reforming minijobs \n\nand Ehega enspli ing, i.e., he join axation of married cou­\n\nples with full income spli ing.\n\nInternational Women’s Day on March 8 is drawing increased \n\na ention o numerous inequalities between women and \n\nmen. In particular, he gender pay gap, which was 18 per­\n\ncent1 for he fourth ime in a row in 2023 according o cal­\n\nculations by he Federal Statistical Office, is moving into he \n\ncenter of he public debate—no leas hanks o he Equal Pay \n\nDay campaign, which falls on March 6 in Germany his year.2\n\nThe difference in unpaid care work between women and \n\nmen, known as he gender care gap, is closely related o he \n\ngender pay gap. Care work includes childcare, housework \n\n(cooking, cleaning, washing), repairs, and informal care of \n\nrelatives.3 Countless studies over he years have investigated \n\nthe gender care gap. 4 Recently, he Federal Statistical Office \n\npublished data on he gender care gap in Germany mount­\n\ning o abou 44 percent.5\n\nConsiderable increase in gender care gap after \n\nbecoming a parent\n\nLike he gender pay gap, he gender care gap is no he same \n\nacross all age groups and increases from age 30 in particu­\n\nlar. For employed individuals aged 35 o 39, he gender care \n\ngap is over 100 percent. This means ha women in his age \n\n1 \n\nThe gender pay gap measures he percentage difference between he average gross hourly \n\nwages of men and women compared o he average gross hourly wages of men.

Accessed on February 16, 2024. This applies o all other online \n\n sources in his repor unless stated otherwise).\n\n2 Equal Pay Day began in he United States and was observed for he firs ime in Germany in \n\n2007. I represents he day each year until which women essentially work unpaid. In 2024, Equal \n\nPay Day is on March 6 (18 percen of 366 days is 66 days).

When, for example, \n\nconsidering he division of housework (i.e., cooking, clean­\n\ning, and washing) as par of unpaid care work before and \n\nafter he birth of a child, here is a sharp decline in he share \n\nof couples who divide housework almos equally (“abou \n\n50/50”). Jus under half of couples divide housework roughly \n\nequally before he birth of he firs child, bu his share is \n\nup o 27 percentage points lower in he years following he \n\nbirth of he child (Figure 1, right-hand side). In contrast, he \n\nshare of couples in which “primarily he mother” or “(almost) \n\nentirely he mother” handles he housework increases sig­\n\nnificantly (by en and 21 percentage points, respectively).\n\nThe share of couples indicating ha he mother primarily \n\nor (almost) entirely handles childcare is also significantly \n\nhigher han he share of couples who divide childcare more \n\nequally (Figure 1, left-hand side). Only a few couples indi­\n\ncated ha he father akes on a larger share of unpaid care \n\nwork compared o he mother, both before and after he birth \n\nof he firs child.\n\nEven more unequal division of care work during \n\nthe firs months of he pandemic\n\nIn March 2020, daycare facilities and schools in Germany \n\nwere closed on shor notice o comba he spread of he \n\ncorona virus. Parents had o make up for he lack of school­\n\ning and childcare options a home o a large extent. A he \n\ntime, many feared ha mothers would primarily ake on he \n\nmajority of he additional educational and childcare asks, \n\nwhich would further increase he already large gender care \n\ngap in Germany.7 On he other hand, some pointed ou he \n\npossibility ha he lack of childcare options could increase \n\nfathers’ participation in childcare and hus bring abou a \n\nchange in social norms in he medium erm.8\n\nCountless empirical studies have examined he division of \n\nunpaid care work during he firs months of he coronavi­\n\nrus pandemic. Studies on Germany using various surveys \n\nfrom he firs weeks and months of he pandemic came o \n\nthe same conclusion: Mothers ook on he majority of he \n\n6 Clara Schäper, Annekatrin Schrenker, and Katharina Wrohlich, “Gender Care Gap and Gen­\n\nder Pay Gap Increase Substantially until Middle Age,” DIW Weekly Repor no. 9 (2023): 99–105 \n\n(available online).\n\n7 A return o raditional gender roles is often discussed in his context.

While he share of couples dividing child­\n\ncare and housework equally remained nearly he same, he \n\nshare of couples who indicated ha he mother performed \n\n(almost) all of hese asks increased. The share of couples in \n\nwhich hese asks were “primarily” performed by he mother \n\ndecreased accordingly.11 Studies on other countries came o \n\nsimilar results (Box 2).\n\nUnequal division of care work declined o \n\npre-pandemic level within one year\n\nEmpirical studies based on data from winter 2020/2021, \n\nnearly a year into he pandemic, concluded ha couples were \n\nspli ing unpaid care work essentially he same as hey did \n\nbefore he pandemic (in 2019) (Figure 2).12 The larger share \n\nof couples in which he mother “(almost) entirely” ook over \n\nchildcare and housework in he firs lockdown in 2020 was \n\nno longer observed in winter 2020/2021.\n\nDivision of care work has no changed wo years \n\nfollowing he star of he pandemic\n\nPairfam data is now available for he second year follow­\n\ning he beginning of he coronavirus pandemic.

In around 30 percen of \n\ncases, childcare was divided evenly. Less han nine percen of \n\nrespondents indicated ha he mother was (almost) entirely \n\nresponsible for childcare. In fewer han hree percen of all \n\nhouseholds in 2019 he father was (almost) entirely or pri­\n\nmarily providing childcare. Very similar pa erns were found \n\nfor housework.\n\nIn comparison, he division of childcare and housework \n\nin early summer 2020, i.e., during he firs survey after he \n\nbeginning of he coronavirus pandemic, was more unequal. \n\nParticularly noticeable is he decline in he share of couples \n\nin which he mother was “primarily” responsible for child­\n\ncare and housework. In contrast, he share of couples in \n\nwhich he mother ook on childcare and housework “(almost) \n\nentirely” increased by almos he same exten (Figure 2). \n\nA detailed analysis of he changes in how couples divide \n\ncare work shows ha some couples in which he mother \n\nwas primarily responsible for hese duties before he pan­\n\ndemic also had a more equal division during he firs lock­\n\ndown (Figure 3). However, some couples who initially had \n\na more equal division switched o a more unequal division \n\nin spring/summer 2020 in which primarily he mother ook \n\non childcare and housework.\n\nNine months later, in winter 2020/2021, he share of cou­\n\nples in which he mother ook care of childcare and house­\n\nwork “(almost) entirely” again declined markedly. Couples \n\nin which he mothers ook on almos all of he childcare a \n\nthe beginning of he pandemic now divide childcare more \n\nequally. In addition, he share of couples dividing house­\n\nwork and childcare roughly equally increased again and was \n\nabove he 2019 pre-pandemic level. The division of childcare \n\nduties remained nearly he same in winter 2021/2022 as well.\n\nThus, he new data from winter 2021/2022 confirm he obser­\n\nvation ha he division of childcare between mothers and \n\nfathers—following a brief more unequal division during he \n\nfirs lockdown in 2020—has no changed significantly fol­\n\nlowing he coronavirus pandemic. A similar picture emerges \n\nfor housework: Although he share of couples in which he \n\nmother was (almost) entirely responsible for housework \n\nincreased by hree percentage points, hese changes were \n\nno statistically significant. Overall, i canno be said with \n\nstatistical certainty ha here have been any changes com­\n\npared o before he pandemic for any constellations of house­\n\nwork division.\n\nConclusion: Large gender care gap in \n\nGermany, bu no lasting increase during he \n\ncoronavirus pandemic\n\nGermany has a relatively large gender care gap compared o, \n\nfor example, he Nordic countries, Sweden, Norway, Finland, \n\nand Denmark. This means ha women perform significantly \n\nmore unpaid care work, such as childcare and housework, \n\ncompared o men. A he beginning of he coronavirus pan­\n\ndemic, many feared ha he related daycare and school clo­\n\nsures could further increase his inequality.

In \n\nthe survey, respondents are asked o provide information abou \n\nthemselves and heir family members, while he family members \n\nanswer a less extensive survey.\n\nAn additional survey was conducted in summer 2020 with he \n\npurpose of investigating societal changes following he corona-\n\nvirus pandemic.2 The focus of he survey was on coronavirus-re­\n\nlated changes o family life. All respondents who participated \n\nin he previous survey wave, or were only emporarily absent, \n\nparticipated in he additional survey. The regular pairfam survey \n\nwas continued in he winters of 2020/2021 and 2021/2022.

The answers hus range from “the \n\nmale partner akes over his area (almost) entirely” o “the female \n\npartner akes over his area (almost) entirely.”\n\nTo examine he changes in he division of unpaid care work, he \n\nresponses from 2018/2019 are used as a reference period and \n\ndeviations during and after he coronavirus pandemic are subse­\n\nquently studied.\n\nThe analyses on he effects of having children on he division of \n\nunpaid care work3 are based on all survey waves from 2008 o \n\n2022. The dependen variable, i.e., differen constellations of care \n\nwork division, is regressed on indicators for he years before and \n\nafter he birth of he firs child. In addition, age and cohor effects \n\nare partialled out. The coefficients displayed hus show how he \n\ndivision of care work has changed relative o he reference period \n\n(two years before he birth of he firs child). As no childcare is per­\n\nfomed before he birth of he firs child, he coefficients are natu­\n\nrally se o zero before he birth of he firs child. In contrast, he \n\ndivision of household labor before he birth of he firs child is in­\n\ndicated in he figures. The estimates are based on a otal of 19,665 \n\nobservations of 5,840 respondents. The sample in he estimation \n\nis limited o couples who will either have a child in he following \n\nsurvey years or had a child in he previous waves.\n\nIn he analysis of he division of care work before, during, and after \n\nthe coronavirus pandemic,4 opposite-gender couples living o­\n\ngether are observed in he corresponding four survey waves. The \n\nsample includes 7,352 observations based on 3,186 respondents. \n\nIn both samples, 56 o 60 percen of he respondents are women.\n\nTo depic he division of care work over he four survey waves \n\naround he pandemic and how his division changed from survey \n\nto survey, he sample is limited o households ha were observed \n\nin all four survey waves.5 This way, i can be ensured ha he \n\n periods between he surveys can be investigated. The sample \n\nincludes 2,324 observations and 581 respondents.\n\n3 See Figure 1 in his Weekly Report.\n\n4 See Figure 2 in his report.\n\n5 See Figure 3 in his report.\n\n81\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 9/2024\n\nGENDER CARE GAP\n\nsummer 2020, inequality in unpaid care work among cou­\n\nples with children had increased compared o he year before \n\nthe pandemic. However, his inequality declined back o its \n\npre-pandemic level within he firs year of he pandemic. \n\nRecen data from he second year after he beginning of he \n\npandemic confirm his finding.\n\nThus, a major reversal of gender roles did no occur as a \n\nresul of he coronavirus pandemic as some had feared. \n\nThe un equal division of unpaid care work between women \n\nand men in Germany did no become more unequal in he \n\nmedium erm, bu instead remained a a high level.\n\nThe gender care gap is associated with many gender gaps \n\non he labor market. Gender inequalities increase in unpaid \n\ncare work as well as on he labor marke when couples have \n\nchildren. If policymakers wan o reduce labor market-re­\n\nlated gender inequalities such as he gender pay gap, hey \n\nneed o also focus on closing he gender care gap. Numerous \n\ncourses of action o create incentives for a more equal divi­\n\nsion of paid and unpaid care work between women and men \n\nhave been on he able for some ime. Expanding he num­\n\nber of partner months during parental allowance (Elterngeld), \n\nfor example, could reduce he considerable inequality in care \n\nwork following he birth of a child. Furthermore, reforming \n\nEhega enspli ing (join axation of married couples with full \n\nincome spli ing) and he ax reatmen of mini-job income \n\ncould reduce he financial “part-time rap” for married \n\nwomen and hus lead o a more equal division of paid work \n\nand care work between women and men in he long erm.\n\nFigure 3\n\nChange in he division of unpaid care work among couples \n\nduring and around he coronavirus pandemic\n\nShares in percent\n\n \n\nSource: Authors’ calculations based on he family panel pairfam.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nA he beginning of he pandemic, many couples divided care work differently, albei \n\nonly emporarily.\n\n82\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 9/2024\n\nGENDER CARE GAP\n\nBox 2\n\nImpac of he coronavirus pandemic on he division of unpaid care work in an international context\n\nWorldwide, women perform considerably more unpaid care work \n\nthan men, although he size of he gender care gap differs between \n\ncountries. In some OECD countries, such as South Korea, Japan, \n\nMexico, and Turkey, he gender care gap is similar o he gap in \n\nGermany. However, he average gender care gap is smaller in \n\nmany other European countries.1 Moreover, an especially large in­\n\ncrease in he gender care gap can be observed following he birth \n\nof a couple’s firs child in Germany compared o other countries.2\n\nThe effects of he coronavirus pandemic on he division of unpaid \n\ncare work have been investigated in many countries. For example, \n\nstudies from he U.S. show ha couples were dividing care work \n\nmore equally in 2020 compared o before he pandemic. However, \n\nhere oo here is an increased burden on mothers compared o \n\n fathers in erms of educating heir children and contempora­\n\nneously managing both paid work and childcare. This burden \n\noccurred primarily due o daycare and school closures and could \n\nbe observed in particular for parents with a low level of education \n\nand low income.3 This also resulted in differences in well-being \n\nbetween mothers and women withou children: Mothers with \n\nyoung children (up o and including primary school age) reported \n\na greater psychological burden during he pandemic.4\n\n1 \n\nOECD, Dare o Share – Deutschlands Weg zur Partnerschaftlichkei in Familie und Beruf ( Paris: \n\n2017) (in German); Jacques Charmes, The Unpaid Care Work and he Labour Market.
