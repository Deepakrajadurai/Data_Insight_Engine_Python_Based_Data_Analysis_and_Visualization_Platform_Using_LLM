A Renewable Energy Pool (RE-Pool), wherein he favorable conditions of competitive enders for new wind and solar power projects are passed on o electricity consumers, could hedge such price risks. Consumers’ electric­ ity prices are hus hedged for he share of heir consumption tha corresponds o he RE-Pool’s generation profile. This, in turn, strengthens he incentives o inves in flexibility, such as",
    "in hea storage systems or ba eries, in order o adjus heir demand o wind and solar electricity production in he pool. In addition, he RE-Pool profile can serve as a reference agains which new products o hedge flexibility can be introduced in the futures and forward markets. The RE-Pool also addresses financing risks linked o regulatory uncertainties faced by renewable energy projects. This reduces financing costs and thus costs for consumers and enhances confidence in future renewable deploymen and hus supports investments into the supply chain of projec developers and manufacturers. The RE-Pool contributes o an even be er use of renewable energy sources in he energy supply and prepares he electricity system for a future powered by a greater share of renewable energy. The electricity generation costs1 for renewable energy sources have decreased considerably over he pas years. For exam­ ple, costs declined by 89 percen for solar installations, by 69 percen for onshore wind installations, and by 59 percen for offshore wind installations from 2010 o 2022 (Figure 1).2 Although over half of he electricity supply now comes from renewable energy sources,3 heir declining costs4 could no protec electricity consumers agains he price shocks on the gas and coal markets in he pas years. This is due o the pricing mechanism on he electricity market, where he mos expensive installation determines he power price in each hour. This means ha he generation costs of gas and coal-fired power plants continue o determine he price of the electricity supply in mos hours. The geopolitical situation as well as he future develop­ men of energy and climate policy remain uncertain. Fossil fuel price shocks canno be ruled ou in he coming years, even if prices have declined recently. This uncertainty is also reflected in he expectations of companies as electricity consumers in he European Union. In a 2023 survey con­ ducted by he European Investmen Bank, 59 percen of companies expressed major concern abou energy prices and 47 percen were worried abou uncertainty regarding price development.5 In principle, companies and energy providers can insure themselves agains fluctuating prices by concluding long- term bilateral power purchasing agreements (PPAs) with electricity producers hrough which prices and delivery 1 The generation costs, or he levelized cos of electricity (LCOE), is a common measure for com­ paring he costs of differen electricity generation echnologies.

    "on interviews with 12,030 companies in he European Union between April and July 2023. 121 DIW Weekly Repor 15/2024 RENEWABLE ENERGY POOL amounts for he coming years are set. However, such bilat­ eral contracts contain challenges for many companies, such as he defaul risk of he contrac partner and collateral ha mus be submi ed. In particular, i is risky for energy-inten­ sive companies o hedge he price of a major share of heir electricity demand via long-term PPAs if he prices of heir final outpu are no insured for a comparable ime period. Therefore, instruments ha avoid he problems of such bilat­ eral contracts and make he electricity marke resilien o future price fluctuations are under discussion. A Renewable Energy Pool allows electricity consumers and renewable energy projec developers o mutually insure agains price risks The RE-Pool6 consists of hree elements (Figure 2). First, a publicly commissioned agency conducts an auction o ender long-term contracts for he outpu of new wind and solar pro­ jects. Second, hese contracts are aggregated into a contrac pool. The pool includes a diverse portfolio of plants with mul­ tiple echnologies and a diverse locations ha began oper­ ating a differen imes. Thus, long-term hedging contracts are aggregated in he RE-Pool, which reduce wind and solar projec developers’ investmen risk. Third, electricity con­ sumers receive a contrac for a share of he electricity gener­ ated in he pool, hus hedging electricity price risks. In his concept, he conditions of he renewable energy projects are passed on o electricity consumers via he pool. The pool is budget-neutral for he federal government. An RE-Pool guarantees financing for future wind and solar projects and addresses uncertainties ha could otherwise endanger German expansion argets and increase he cos of he energy ransition. A he same ime, electricity con­ sumers directly benefi from he cos reductions in renew­ able energy. Affordable and reliable electricity prices are a prerequisite for further electrification, which is an importan componen in many sectors in he ransition owards a cli­ mate-neutral economy. Thereby, hey contribute o he suc­ cess of he industrial ransition. By passing on he benefits of wind and solar energy directly o electricity consumers, the RE-Pool also increases political suppor for he energy transition. Consumers can benefi from affordable renewable energy via an RE-Pool The elements of he RE-Pool build upon previously developed and well understood instruments. The long-term contracts are awarded o renewable energy plan operators in auctions by a publicly commissioned entity. The prices of successful bids define he contrac price for he respective hedging of a project’s electricity price risk, as was previously he case in he auctions according o he German Renewable Energy Ac (EEG). If he marke price is lower han his contrac 6 The concep of renewable energy pools as well as he calculations in his Weekly Repor are based on Karsten Neuhoff e al., “Contracting Ma ers: Hedging Consumers and Producers with a Renewable Energy Pool,” DIW Diskussionspapier no. 2035 (2023) (available online). price",

In addition o the curren German system, he plan operator mus reim­ burse he surplus revenue o he RE-Pool in hours in which the marke price is higher han he contrac price. Such symmetrical long-term contracts hedge electricity produc­ ers agains price risks, allowing he projects o be realized a low financing costs.7 The previous one-sided hedging via he sliding marke pre­ mium for new projects would come o an end with he intro­ duction of he RE-Pool. This motivates developers of new wind and solar projects o participate in he pool. A further advantage of he RE-Pool is he ability o hedge agains reg­ ulatory uncertainties, such as he introduction of price zones or local prices. By switching o symmetric hedging, he benefits of he sym­ metrical contracts can be passed on o he consumers. All of the long-term contracts are aggregated in he RE Pool, which is defined by he sum of its generation and average contrac price. Electricity generated from he RE-Pool is hen pro­ portionally allocated o he consumers. Under he previous suppor regime, consumers only incurred costs ha were passed on via he EEG surcharge and have been paid from 7 Cf. Mats Kröger, Karsten Neuhoff, and Jörn C.

Following he introduc­ tion of symmetric hedging, however, consumers will benefi from payments during periods of high electricity prices. If symmetric contrac structures had already been introduced in he past, i would have led o large payments and o a sig­ nifican reduction in he burden on consumers during he energy price crisis.8 The advantage of passing on he hedg­ ing contracts is ha he payments in years with low electric­ ity prices do no burden he federal budge as in he previ­ ous suppor regime, as he payments and reimbursements of pool consumers and electricity producers balance each other ou each period. 8 Cf. Jörn Richstein, Frederik Le ow, and Karsten Neuhoff, “Marktprämie bescher Betreibern erneuerbarer Energien Zusatzgewinne – Differenzverträge würden VerbraucherInnen entlasten,” DIW aktuell no. 77 (in German; available online). As further auctions are held each year as par of Germany’s renewable energy expansion argets, he RE-Pool volume would increase steadily over he years. If introduced for",
    "all new enders starting from 2025 (Figure 3), he RE-Pool would consis of onshore wind and solar power installations in the firs few years. Due o he longer projec developmen times, offshore wind installations would be added beginning in 2029. In his case, over 100 TWh of generation could be hedged via he pool from 2028 if Germany’s renewable ar­ gets are reached. The exac price of he RE-Pool depends on the generation costs of differen renewable energy echnol­ ogies and sites reflected in he bidding process. By weight­ ing he forecasted echnology-specific generation costs9 with the respective pool volumes, suggests ha pool prices in he range of 50 o 60 euros per megawa hour. An importan question is wha risks electricity consum­ ers are assuming when participating in an RE-Pool, espe­ cially if electricity prices fall below he prices in he RE-Pool in he long erm. Such a price drop could happen if renew­ able energy generation costs continue o fall or renewable electricity projects outside he pool would be subsidized. In principle, his could lead o a structural disadvantage for companies participating in he pool. This can be avoided if electricity consumers in he pool receive an exi option, for example with a five-year notice period. In case of an exit, he federal government, as guarantor of he RE-Pool, would have to cover he costs of he remaining contracts. This creates a de facto regulatory guarantee from he federal governmen to he companies in he RE-Pool, which protects hem from disadvantages due o future regulatory measures like a sub­ sidy for installations outside of he pool. On he other hand, a long notice period, for example five years, ensures ha con­ sumers remain in he pool and commi ed o he deal of a mutual insurance of producers and consumers also in peri­ ods of emporarily lower whole-sale prices. RE-Pool access should prioritize consumer segments particularly affected by he ransition There are various options for allocating he electricity gen­ erated in he RE-Pool among he consumers: “pro-rata” allo­ cation, auctions, or prioritization. Under a “pro-rata” allocation, all electricity consumers are hedged according o heir share of otal electricity consump­ tion. This would be he simples and mos plausible method in he long erm. However, i would no provide sufficien hedging for groups of priority consumers who will be par­ ticularly affected in he coming years, as he RE-Pool volume mus firs be buil up. A second option would be o allocate the RE-Pool via an auction. This would lead o he companies tha are able o pay he mos receiving access o he hedge. This would no necessarily benefi companies ha require stable and competitive electricity prices in order o inves in transition processes. 9 International Energy Agency, World Energy Outlook 2023 (Paris: IEA, 2023) (available online).

This includes companies who are investing in electrifica­ tion processes and hus have a particular need for hedging their electricity costs as well as energy-intensive manufac­ turing companies ha are under strong international com­ petitive pressure. The uncertainty of he ransition process could be reduced for hese groups and he necessary invest­ men security increased. A hird group consists of he res­ idents living close o new wind and solar parks. Allocation to his group could increase acceptance for he parks.10 The public interes in he projects and heir positive externalities would justify such prioritized allocation. Discussions with stakeholders have revealed a significan interes from potential consumers for shares in an RE-Pool. Thus, i can be assumed ha he demand for he pool shares would exceed supply in he shor erm and he se ing of access criteria would likely be a subjec o competing inter­ ests. However, a similar dynamic is o be expected even with­ ou an RE-Pool during imes of high electricity prices and resulting possible governmen interventions. In any case, i mus be noted ha any decisions abou prioritization mus be discussed and decided upon in an open and ransparen parliamentary process. RE-Pool offers advantages due o electricity price security and low financing costs For consumers, he RE-Pool offers he advantage of hedg­ ing heir electricity costs. They are spared high bills in imes of unexpectedly high energy prices, which decreases pres­ sure on he federal governmen o ake action in he mar­ ke o lower prices via ad hoc measures or o use budgetary resources o relieve electricity consumers. During he 2022 energy price crisis, an RE-Pool would have led o considerably lower cos increases for participating consumers (Figure 4).11 Moreover, hedging electricity price risk is associated with be er plannability and investmen security. For instance, private homeowners can be er calculate he economics of installing a hea pump. For companies i lowers he risk of investing in electrification processes o reduce emissions. Consumers could heoretically achieve he same effec using bilateral contracts with electricity suppliers. However, financ­ ing costs for wind and solar projects, and hus he elec­ tricity generation costs, would be en percen higher under such bilateral contracts compared o he RE-Pool, as a DIW Berlin study shows.12 This is he case because, in contras o a state-guaranteed contract, he counterparty’s defaul risk is greater. In addition, bilateral contracts have a negative 10 Jakob Knauf, “Can’ buy me acceptance?

This increases he financing costs and rep­ resents a further 20-percen cos increase for he renewable electricity ha has been hedged. Furthermore, no all com­ panies can conclude such bilateral electricity contracts in the amoun of heir actual electricity demand in practice. Thus, he RE-Pool increases he scope of consumers hedged agains price fluctuations in he long erm and reduces he cos of he energy ransition. Lastly, he RE-Pool has he advantage of a “fla er” generation profile compared o bilateral hedging of electricity consum­ ers via individual projects. By aggregating all of he wind and solar installations in Germany—and in neighboring coun­ tries as well in he medium and long erm—the generation volatility is reduced. This can be shown schematically for a pool comprised of equal shares of he curren German solar and offshore wind installations compared o generation from only onshore wind installations (Figure 5). RE-Pool creates incentives for flexible electricity demand Another advantage of an RE-Pool would be ha electricity consumers would be incentivized o inves in flexibility as well as o adjus heir demand o short-term price signals dur­ ing operation. These incentives arise because consumers are hedged by heir share in he RE-Pool via he RE-Pool’s gen­ eration profile. Therefore, hey are only fully hedged agains Figure 3 Volume and price developmen of an RE-Pool In erawa hours (lef axis); euros per megawa hour (2023, righ axis) Sources: Klaus Mindrup and Karsten Neuhoff, “Eneuerbare Energeien und Flexibilitä – Optionen für reduzierte und verlässliche Stromkosten,” DIW Politikberatung kompakt, no. 197 (2023); calculations based on he German federal government’s expansion plans for renewable energy sources and predicted generation costs from he 2023 IEA World Energy Outlook. © DIW Berlin 2024 The maximum volume of he RE-Pool will already be over 100 erawa hours in 2028 if all new projects are aggregated into he pool beginning in 2025. 124 DIW Weekly Repor 15/2024 RENEWABLE ENERGY POOL the electricity price risk if heir demand follows he profile of the pool’s generation perfectly. This means ha consumers with less flexible demand are exposed o he electricity price risks of he short-term markets for he share of heir demand tha deviates from he hedge provided by he RE-Pool. This creates incentives o ap into cost-effective flexibility poten­ tials, which keeps costs low for electricity consumers and he entire system. For example, companies can inves in flexibi­ lization of production, for example with storage of hea and industrial intermediate products. The magnitude of costs incurred by electricity consumers with inflexible demand, and hus also he amoun of incen­ tives for investments in flexibility, can be illustrated with he help of marke value defined as he revenue a plan would",
    "have obtained if i were o sell all production a he spo price of each hour (Figure 6). The green area depicts he 12-month moving average of he marke value of an RE-Pool compared to he average of he wholesale spo prices. Generally, his value is below 100 percen because he electricity price ends to be below average when he supply of renewable electricity is high. The green line represents he electricity costs of flex­ ible consumers who can perfectly adjus heir demand o he RE-Pool’s generation profile. Inflexible consumers, in con­ trast, incur costs, as hey mus procure electricity outside of the hedging via he RE-Pool. This would be he case primarily in hours of low production from renewable energy sources, in which he spo marke price is higher han he average price of he pool. With he hypothetical RE-Pool assumed in this example, hese costs (gray area) would currently be jus under 20 percen of he electricity price for electricity cus­ tomers with completely inflexible demand. Hedging with he RE-Pool’s generation profile does no only lead o incentives in increasing demand flexibility, bu should also contribute o further developing he electricity derivatives market. Each company can decide o wha exten i invests in its own flexibility or hedges hrough he forwards and futures market. In urn, his demand for forward products for flexibility allows flexibility providers o secure revenue from he flexible operation of ba eries or hea storage sys­ tems and hus improves investmen framework conditions. Design of RE-Pool should be compatible with future electricity marke reforms When designing he ender procedures and long-term con­ tracts between he RE-Pool and wind and solar projects, i mus be ensured ha installations are buil and operated in a system-friendly manner and ha plants do no pro­ duce in periods of negative electricity prices. There are var­ ious options for his: One is o hedge he hourly electricity price for producers bu have clear regulations stipulating tha plants do no receive any remuneration during hours of negative electricity prices. However, his would resul in a loss of revenue ha is difficul o predict. A further option for lowering producers’ revenue risk would be o hedge he potential generation outpu during hours of negative elec­ tricity prices instead of he actual outpu of he plant. This Figure 4 Electricity costs with an RE-Pool compared o procuremen withou hedging In euros per megawa hour Notes: Electricity costs withou hedging calculated using price and demand data from 2015 o 2022; with pool also based on RE generation from 2015 o 2022; with flexibility based on a “spread product” ha pays he difference between he four highes and lowes hours; same average costs in he scenarios.

    "incentives and maintain revenue security and low financing costs. Various research groups have made com­ parable proposals in recen months, all of which are based on decoupling he payments for symmetrical hedging from the actual production decisions of he plan operators.13 An RE-Pool is also compatible with hese proposals. The design of he RE-Pool should be chosen in such a way tha electricity consumers are hedged agains regulatory uncertainties regarding possible future electricity marke reforms. One example of his is he introduction of local prices or electricity price zones, which could replace he German single price zone o be er align electricity demand and supply a a local level and hus avoid ransmission con­ straints. The contracts in he RE-Pool should be specified in such a way ha both electricity producers and consum­ ers in he RE-Pool are directly hedged agains he electricity price a heir feed-in or purchase point. However, his could have he effec ha he payments o and from he RE-Pool no longer balance each other out. The resulting revenues from introducing locational pricing should be used o eliminate these price differences.14 This would secure budge neutral­ ity of he RE-Pool. Conclusion: An RE-Pool hedges both electricity producers and consumers agains price risks An RE-Pool is an a ractive option for passing on he advan­ tages of electricity producers’ hedged electricity prices o he consumers. In an RE-Pool, long-term hedging contracts ha lower he investmen risk of wind and solar projec devel­ opers are aggregated into a contrac pool. In a second step, this advantage is passed on o he electricity consumers. By lowering he investmen risk, he pool reduces he financ­ ing costs for renewable energy projects and hus costs for renewables o consumers. I makes i possible for electricity consumers o hedge hemselves agains future price shocks. Furthermore, i supports investments in flexibility and he developmen of financial hedging products compatible with renewable energy sources. The RE-Pool is an importan par of an electricity marke with increasing shares of renewa­ ble energy. 13 Cf.

A spli of larger pricing zones or an introduction of locational pricing would reduce or eliminate hese costs and instead resul in congestion revenue tha can be used for reducing grid ariffs and hedging locational price differences in an RE-pool.
