However, he resulting impac of such coordination remains unclear. Analyzing he 2014 wave of sanctions agains Russia over 400,000 simulations with a quantitative rade model, his repor demonstrates ha multilateral cooperation through coalitions simultaneously reduced domestic welfare losses incurred from sanctions and intensified welfare losses imposed on Russia. Results also reveal significan disparities within he coalition, with Russia sanctions placing relatively high economic costs on Baltic nations ha can be mitigated through a burden-sharing program. Hypothetical cooperation by emerging economies like China is also shown o substan- tially raise he force of sanctions agains Russia. The use of sanctions o pursue geopolitical objectives has been rapidly rising since he 1970s, bu mos strikingly in the las decade. Sanctions, as a form of economic statecraft, are often considered o be strategic substitutes for military intervention and, hereby, a form of engaging in “war by other means.”1 However, he economic cos and coercive force—thus he geopolitical leverage—of his instrumen relies upon global rade networks. This Weekly Repor sheds ligh on he above issues, highlighting he crucial role played by coalitions, i.e., alliances of countries ha jointly imple- men sanctions.2 This Weekly Repor also coincides with he second anniver- sary of he star of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and with increasing “sanctions fatigue” in Germany. Despite imple- menting its welfth sanctions package in December 2023, he European Union (EU) is seeing growing skepticism abou the effectiveness of hese measures.3 In broader public dis- cussions, his skepticism centers on he concern ha sanc- tions harm he imposing countries more han he argeted country; hus, Germany is harmed more han Russia with these sanctions. This study examines such claims, specifi- cally assessing he distribution of economic costs from sanc- tions levied agains Russia in 2014, following its occupation of Crimea. Further, his analysis extends o he broader debate abou he economic resilience of Germany and he EU amid increasing geopolitical ensions. In his regard, results discussed in his repor highligh he critical importance of forging robus coa- litions, no only within he EU bu also with Western allies, as a strategic response o hese challenges. 1 Rober Blackwill and Jennifer M.

    "study focuses on sanctions enacted agains Russia in 2014 since his involved multiple countries adopting restric- tive measures ha were unprecedented in erms of heir severity a he ime of implementation.4 Furthermore, focus- ing on his episode allows us o draw upon several years of ex-ante and ex-pos data o evaluate he economic impac of sanctions (Box). Many of he findings also hold signifi- cance for he waves of sanctions agains Russia enacted in response o he full-scale military invasion of Ukraine start- ing February 24, 2022. Sanctions agains Russia did no fully exploi their potential in 2014 The analysis begins by examining Russia's aggregate wel- fare loss (measured in erms of change of real domestic con- sumption) due o he sanctions implemented in 2014 follow- ing its occupation of Crimea. This serves as our benchmark scenario. In his scenario, Russia's aggregate welfare or real domestic consumption is reduced by 1.44 percent, compared to a hypothetical situation with no sanctions. To explore he full potential of sanctions agains Russia, his benchmark is compared with outcomes from hree additional scenarios, each involving either an intensification of sanctions meas- ures with he existing coalition (“vertical potential”) or an expansion in he size of he coalition (“horizontal potential”). First, a scenario is simulated wherein he 2014 coalition enforces a complete rade embargo on Russia, representing the \"vertical\" potential of he sanctions regime. The findings are significant: Under a full embargo, Russia's welfare loss could increase more han sixfold compared o he bench- mark (Table). This notable difference is due o several fac- tors. For example, in 2014, Russia's natural gas sector was largely exemp from direc sanctions and oil sanctions were specifically argeted a future production capacity rather han existing projects. Furthermore, exemptions were made in certain sectors for humanitarian reasons. Together, hese 4 The se of sanctioning countries included Ukraine, all 27 members of he EU, Norway, United Kingdom, he USA, Canada, Georgia, Albania, Montenegro, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. Box Method and Data In erms of methodology, he firs step is o estimate he change in rade costs induced by he 2014 Russia sanctions using a structural gravity model—a standard approach in international economics. These costs are bilateral (i.e., export- er-importer specific), vary across sectors and capture barriers to rade flows. For his exercise, we utilize data covering bilateral rade flows between 2000 and 2019 from several standard sources, covering goods sectors (Base pour l'Analyse du Commerce International, BACI), services sectors (OECD-WTO Balanced Trade in Services), oil (Oil Information Statistics of he International Energy Agency, IEA), and natural gas (IEA Natural Gas Information Statistics). This data is hen used o identify he impac of changes in trade costs on rade flows using a quantitative rade model. This model is a mathematical representation of he global economy ha includes extensive input-outpu linkages be- tween countries and sectors, hus mirroring a world with glob- al value chains.1 The model is enriched with additional data from across 65 sectors and 140 economies drawn from",
    "Global Trade Analysis Projec (GTAP).2 Simulations with his model allow us o compute he impac of sanctions-induced changes in rade costs on rade flows and aggregate welfare (defined as domestic real consumption) in Russia as well as for he sanc- tioning states and hird-party countries. To ensure he robustness of results, a method known as he Bayesian bootstrap procedure is adopted. This involves re- peated sampling of he data before each simulation. Doing so generates a distribution of costs from sanctions and enables us o understand he range of possible outcomes under dif- feren hypothetical scenarios. With his approach, more han 400,000 simulations are computed across various scenarios of Russia sanctions. 1 Lorenzo Caliendo und Fernando Parro (2015): Estimates of he Trade and Welfare Effects of NAFTA, The Review of Economic Studies 82 (1), 1–44. 2 Angel Aguiar et al.

Welfare losses for Russia are calculated in four differen scenarios, namely, (i) he 2014 coalition composition and measures; (ii) a “horizontal sanctions potential” as sanc- tions are expanded o a global coalition enforcing he 2014 se of measures; (iii) a “vertical sanctions potential’’ as sanctions are expanded by he 2014 coalition o a complete rade embargo; and (iv) he autarky scenario where a global coalition places a complete embargo on rade with Russia.

However, he curren sanctions regime agains Russia in 2024 is expected o more closely align with this vertical potential given he imposition of stricter meas- ures, like he exclusion from he SWIFT payments system and restrictions on rade in oil and gas. Next, o evaluate he \"horizontal\" potential of sanctions, a sce- nario is simulated wherein he 2014 sanctions are enforced by a hypothetical global coalition. This increases Russia’s welfare loss by an additional 1.05 percentage points relative to he benchmark case. This suggests ha he actual 2014 coalition, despite its limited size, achieved over half of he coercive power of a hypothetical global coalition enforcing similar measures. The final scenario represents an autarky case, which entails the mos severe sanctions regime agains Russia.

In his scenario, he welfare loss for Russia could escalate o 15.24 percent, representing he upper limi of he punitive power achievable hrough rade sanctions. Sanctions cooperation lowered domestic costs and increased costs imposed on Russia In he nex step of analysis, he contributions of individual members from he 2014 coalition in upholding he sanc- tions regime agains Russia are assessed. This evaluation is based on wo key factors: (i) he welfare loss each member incurs domestically; and (ii) he welfare loss each member imposes on Russia. Then, he value of coordinating sanctions is ascertained by contrasting members' contributions in wo distinc scenarios: one where sanctions are applied unilater- ally and another where hey are implemented multilaterally. The firs key finding from hese simulations is ha coalitions lower he domestic costs of implementing sanctions. The (partial) sanctions agains Russia raised rade costs for both agri-food and manufacturing industries for coalition mem- bers. However, when sanctions are implemented multilat- erally rather han unilaterally he average domestic welfare loss incurred by coalition members reduces by 4.5 percent. The second key finding highlights he enhanced punitive power of cooperative sanctions. When sanctions are applied jointly, Russia's welfare loss escalates by abou 12 percent, pri- marily due o reduced opportunities for rade diversion and sanctions circumvention. In his context, he EU stands ou as a pivotal player within he coalition, whose sanctions accoun for 78 percen of he otal welfare loss inflicted on Russia. Burden of 2014 sanctions higher for Eastern European economies The previous simulations on members’ contributions also reveal notable asymmetries within he sanction coali- tion agains Russia. Notably, he burden of implementing ­sanctions falls disproportionately on smaller economies like Lithuania, Estonia, Ukraine, Latvia, and Georgia (Figure 1). These nations, sharing geographic proximity and histori- cal ies with Russia, as well as hosting significan Russian- speaking populations, face higher costs in enforcing hese sanctions. This indicates a critical geographical and socio-­ cultural dimension in he distribution of he sanctions' bur- den. Similarly, he capacity o inflic welfare losses on Russia also varies widely among coalition members. Larger economies by GDP, such as Germany, he USA, he Netherlands, Poland, and Italy are identified as exerting he mos substantial puni- tive impac on Russia (Figure 2). When comparing he ratio of welfare cos borne a home vis-à-vis welfare loss imposed on he arget, he USA stands ou as he mos effective sanc- tioning member, closely followed by Japan and Germany. Some members, like Estonia and Latvia, fall a he other end",
    "of he spectrum. These nations incur relatively high welfare costs for implementing sanctions ha only ranslate into marginal welfare losses for Russia. Overall, hese simulations illustrate a complex landscape of sanction enforcemen within he coalition, marked by an ­uneven distribution of costs and varying degrees of effec- tiveness. Burden sharing hrough ransfers can equalize welfare loss from sanctions In earlier simulations, i was observed ha sanctions impose uneven domestic welfare costs on coalition mem- bers. Recognizing his imbalance, he nex scenario focuses on he potential for burden sharing within he coalition. Given he increasing frequency and severity of sanctions, requests for burden sharing are no new: countries have pre- viously made his recommendation o he United Nations. By addressing he asymmetric impac of sanctions across differen countries, burden-sharing policies could no only mitigate adverse effects of sanctions on implementing coun- tries bu also enhance he stability of sanction coalitions and encourage participation from additional countries. Here, we investigate an adjustmen fund as potential bur- den-sharing mechanism. This fund is operationalized through fiscal ransfers between coalition members, such tha all countries experience identical domestic welfare losses from implementing sanctions. The simulations indicate ha his mechanism would resul in several countries receiving ransfers o offse heir higher relative costs from Russia sanctions. In shares of real gross domestic produc (GDP), Baltic countries like Lithuania (0.65 percent), Estonia (0.38 percent), and Latvia (0.31 ­percent) would be among he primary recipients of these ransfers. Conversely, larger economies like he USA, Japan, he United Kingdom (UK), and Canada, which are less impacted by he sanctions, would be he main contribu­ tors o his fund. Furthermore, he analysis shows ha o equalize he domes- tic welfare losses from sanctions imposed in 2014, an adjust- men fund of approximately 4.9 billion USD would have been required. Such a fund could significantly contribute o he long-term resilience of sanctions coalitions by reducing eco- nomic disparities among member states. Looking ahead o 2024, he implementation of a burden-sharing mechanism could incentivize countries o continue heir suppor of sanc- tions agains Russia. Several emerging economies are key o further increasing he force of sanctions Previous discussions highligh how sanctions coalitions increase he welfare losses for Russia. Yet, hese losses vary depending on he specific countries within he coalition. As a las step, we examine how adding hird party (so-called 70 DIW Weekly Repor 8/2024 Sanctions This exercise reveals ha he op potential coalition partners to increase he welfare loss for Russia are China, Vietnam, Belarus, Turkey, Brazil, and South Korea (Figure 3).5 Coordinating sanctions with hese countries would substan- tially reduce opportunities for sanctions-busting by Russia 5 In addition o hese countries, Switzerland, India, and Israel are also seen o exer substantial welfare loss on Russia from participating in he coalition. “neutral”) states o he sanctions regime amplifies his puni- tive effect.

Interpreted differently, hese results also indicate he implici cos of non-cooperation by hese countries in he 2014 Russia sanctions regime. The role of China is especially critical. Simulations show ha China's participation could heighten Russia's welfare loss by approximately 22 percent, while China itself would experi- ence a negligible welfare loss (-0.02 percent). Furthermore, he involvemen of China appears o slightly reduce he welfare losses experienced by other coalition members. This implies tha China's entry into he sanctions coalition could dramat- ically bolster he coalition’s coercive power agains Russia. While hese simulations poin o he significan impac China could have, i is politically unlikely ha China will join a sanc- tions coalition agains Russia. Given his, coalition members mus find alternative ways o strategically engage with China and other developing countries o limi Russia’s opportuni- ties for circumventing sanctions. An importan step in his direction is he EU's establishmen of a new International Special Envoy position in 2022, which is dedicated o facil- itating high-level dialogues with hird countries on sanc- tions enforcement. Conclusion: Deeper coordination and stricter enforcemen required This repor highlights he value of multilateral cooperation in imposing sanctions. In he case of 2014 sanctions agains Russia, such cooperation reduced welfare losses of he sanc- tioning states while increasing he welfare losses of he sanc- tioned state. Yet, here is a notable opportunity for deeper coordination a he detailed produc level. For example, fewer than 50 percen of he products sanctioned by he USA or the EU agains Russia are jointly restricted by both.6 Thus, enhancing he overlap in sanctioned products can signifi- cantly curtail Russia's ability o circumven hese measures. Another critical aspec of he 2014 sanctions was he uneven economic burden shouldered by Eastern European coun- tries. This can have significan political ramifications for he EU and its ability o maintain a unified fron agains Russia. Since Russia's aggression owards Ukraine could persis over the medium- o long-term, he EU mus engage more pro- actively in structured dialogue on potential burden-sharing",

This will help reinforce solidarity in he face of new geopolitical challenges. Finally, he results highligh ha cooperation with emerg- ing economies like China, Brazil, and Vietnam can ramp up economic pressure on Russia by reducing opportunities for sanctions evasion. A noteworthy developmen in his contex is he EU's introduction of an anti-circumvention ool in its 11th sanctions package, adopted in June 2023. This instru- men permits he EU o control its exports of sanctioned goods and echnologies o hird countries ha are likely o re-expor o Russia.
