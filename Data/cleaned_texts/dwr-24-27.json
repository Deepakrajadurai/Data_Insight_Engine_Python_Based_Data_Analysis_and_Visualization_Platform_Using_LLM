Using Socio-­\n\nEconomic Panel (SOEP) data, this Weekly Report calculates \n\nthe amount of CO2 equivalents emitted by households due to \n\nresidential energy use, nutrition, and transport in Germany. \n\nConsumption in these three areas alone results in average \n\nemissions that exceed the emissions budget targeted for pri­\n\nvate individuals more than twofold, with transport and residen­\n\ntial energy-related emissions accounting for the largest share \n\nof emissions. Emissions increase as income increases, espe­\n\ncially in the area of transport, with air travel as the main driver. \n\nMeat consumption is the main contributor to nutrition-related \n\nemissions, and household size and building type contribute \n\nthe most to residential energy-related emissions. By identify­\n\ning the most significant driver of emissions in each of the three \n\nareas, targeted political instruments can be identified, such as \n\nsimplifying housing swaps and the energy-efficient renovation \n\nof residential buildings, banning short-haul flights, and intro­\n\nducing an animal welfare levy.\n\nHuman emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon diox­\n\nide (CO2), nitrous oxide, and methane are the main driver \n\nof climate change.1 According to the Federal Environment \n\nAgency (Umweltbundesamt, UBA), around 673 million tons \n\nof greenhouse gases were emitted in Germany in 2023, ten \n\npercent less than in 2022.2 However, the Federal Climate \n\nChange Act stipulates that emissions must be reduced by at \n\nleast 65 percent compared to 1990 levels by 2030. However, as \n\nof 2022, only 40 percent of this reduction had been achieved.3\n\nTo reduce greenhouse gas emissions more effectively, it is \n\nimportant to understand their primary driver. Policymakers \n\nshould consider both the reduction potential in industry as \n\nwell as in private households: After all, around one third of \n\nemissions in Germany can be attributed to private house­\n\nhold consumption.4 This Weekly Report calculates and ana­\n\nlyzes the average per capita residential energy consump­\n\ntion (housing), nutrition, and transport-related emissions \n\nin Germany using individual and household information.\n\nThe analyses are based on unpublished preliminary data \n\nfrom the 2023 Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) survey.5 We \n\ncalculate per capita residential energy, nutrition, and trans­\n\nport-related carbon footprint6 of private households based \n\non respondents’ information on their consumption behav­\n\nior (Box). First, the carbon footprint of the entire house­\n\nhold is calculated. In a second step, the household’s total \n\n1\t\n\nTo be able to compare the effects of the various climate-active gases on the climate, they are \n\nconverted into CO2 equivalents. For this purpose, emissions of greenhouse gases other than CO2 \n\nare converted into CO2 equivalents according to their global warming potential.\n\n2\t Umweltbundesamt, Treibhausgasemissionen sinken deutlich (2024) (in German; available \n\n­online; accessed on June 11, 2024. This applies to all other online sources in this report).\n\n3\t Bundesregierung, Ein Plan fürs Klima (2024) (in German; available online); Umweltbundesamt, \n\nTreibhausgasminderungsziele Deutschlands (2023) (in German; available online).\n\n4\t Statistisches Bundesamt, CO2-Emissionsintensität der deutschen Wirtschaft 2020 weiterhin \n\nrückläufig (2022) (in German; available online).\n\n5\t The Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) is an annual representative survey of private households. \n\nIt began in West Germany in 1984 and expanded its scope to include the new federal states in \n\n1990; cf. Jan Goebel et al., “The German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP),” Journal of Economics and \n\n­Statistics 239, no. 29 (2018): 345-360.\n\n6\t Carbon footprints indicate how many tons of CO2 equivalents (tCO2e) one person generates \n\nper year. It is a measure of one individual’s impact on the climate, see the DIW Berlin Glossary on \n\nthe carbon footprint (in German; available online).\n\n181\n\nDIW Weekly Report 27/2024\n\nCARBON FOOTPRINT\n\nemissions are divided by the number of household mem­\n\nbers, including children.\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions of private households \n\nexceed climate thresholds twofold\n\nAccording to the SOEP survey data, annual per capita emis­\n\nsions in the three areas (residential energy consumption, \n\nnutrition, and transport) are around 6.5 tons of CO2 equiv­\n\nalents (tCO2e). Each person in Germany emits an annual \n\naverage of 0.7 tCO2e through the use of electricity in their \n\nhome (Figure 1). A further 2.2 tCO2e are due to heating and \n\nhot water preparation. Nutrition has an average impact of \n\n1.6 tCO2e, while 2.0 tCO2e can be attributed to transport. \n\nCalculations using SOEP data are thus very close to the UBA’s \n\ncalculations, which are calculated using a different methodol­\n\nogy.7 The values in both calculations are significantly higher \n\nthan the one to three tons that are—depending on the spe­\n\ncific calculation—climate-compatible according to climate \n\nexperts and the UBA.8\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions increase with income\n\nOur calculations confirm that households’ carbon footprint \n\nincreases as equivalized income rises,9 primarily due to more \n\ntransport-related emissions (Figure 2). In terms of nutrition \n\nand heating, higher-income households tend to have slightly \n\nlower per capita emissions. The following sections take a \n\ncloser look at the composition of emissions in the areas of \n\nresidential energy, nutrition, and transport, and explain the \n\ndifferences between the income groups using information \n\non all households for which an area-specific carbon foot­\n\nprint was calculated.\n\nLiving with others reduces CO2 emissions\n\nEmissions from residential use of electricity, heating, and hot \n\nwater preparation are considered together below. On aver­\n\nage, 2.9 tons of residential energy-related CO2e are emitted \n\nper person per year. As people who live together share the \n\nuse of electricity and heat, the number of people living in a \n\nhousehold is decisive for the emissions caused per person \n\n7\t Cf. the website of the Federal Environment Agency, Durchschnittlicher CO2-Fußabdruck pro \n\nKopf in Deutschland (Stand: 2024) (in German; available online).\n\n8\t Federal Environment Agency, Wie hoch sind die Treibhausgasemissionen pro Person? (2024) \n\n(in German, online verfügbar). Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, a climate researcher at the Potsdam \n\nInstitute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), calculated a carbon footprint of around three tons \n\nper year and per person for Germany, which would have to be achieved in order to comply with \n\nthe Paris Climate Agreement—an individual CO2 budget, so to speak, cf. Dirk Messner et al., “The \n\nBudget Approach: A Framework for a Global Transformation toward a Low-Carbon Economy,” \n\n­Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy 2, no. 3 (2010) (available online). How exactly this fig­\n\nure of three tons per year and per person was calculated is explained very well on the website of \n\nthe ARD program Panorama (FAQ: Wer verursacht wie viele Treibhausgase?) (in German; available \n\nonline).\n\n9\t The income situations of households of different sizes and compositions are made comparable \n\nusing equivalized income. To calculate the equivalized income, the incomes of all persons living \n\nin the household are added together and converted using a needs scale appropriate to the house­\n\nhold structure. For more information, see the DIW Berlin Glossary entry on equivalized income \n\n(in German; available online). For more on the carbon footprint of German households, cf.

A four-person house­\n\nhold generates an average of 1.5 tCO2e per person and year, \n\nwhereas a single-person household generates just under \n\n4.0 tCO2e per year (Figure 3).\n\nUsing a linear regression model, we investigate the correla­\n\ntion between various household characteristics and residen­\n\ntial energy-related emissions per person (Table). The decisive \n\nfactor is therefore the number of people in the household. In \n\naddition, the living space available per person has a signifi­\n\ncant, albeit smaller, influence on emissions: For each addi­\n\ntional square meter of space, emissions per person rise by \n\n0.022 tCO2e per year. These two factors alone explain nearly \n\nhalf of the observed differences in residential energy-related \n\nemissions per capita. In contrast, the income available per \n\nperson has no significant effect when the factors of people \n\nand space per person are taken into account.\n\nThe type and age of residential buildings also plays a role: \n\nPeople living in multiple-family residential buildings with \n\nmore than four housing units create around half a ton fewer \n\nemissions per person than people living in detached single \n\nor two-family homes or farming infrastructure (Figure 4). \n\nIn addition, the carbon footprint of people living in newer \n\nbuildings is lower.10 Calculations also show that the use of \n\nsolar energy decreases the per capita carbon footprint in a \n\nhousehold by around 0.7 tCO2e on average.\n\nMeat consumption affects nutrition-related \n\nemissions\n\nAround one quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions can \n\nbe attributed to food production, in particular from livestock \n\nfarming, fisheries, and land use.11 Compared to livestock \n\n10\t Cf. Sections 10 through 45 of the Buildings Energy Act (Gesetz zur Einsparung von Energie und \n\nzur Nutzung erneuerbarer Energien zur Wärme- und Kälteerzeugung in Gebäuden, GEG) (in German; \n\navailable online).\n\n11\t Hannah Ritchie, “Food production is responsible for one-quarter of the world’s greenhouse \n\ngas emissions,” Our world in data (2019) (available online).\n\nBox\n\nData and methodology\n\nThe carbon footprint of households in Germany due to residential \n\nenergy consumption, nutrition, and transport are calculated using \n\npreliminary data from 2023 from the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). \n\nAs no weighting factors are currently available for 2023, preliminary \n\nweights from the 2022 survey are used, which take into account \n\nthe households lost since the last published survey in 2021. People \n\nwho first participated in the survey in 2023 are thus not included. \n\nFurthermore, all refugee samples are not taken into account. Due to \n\nthese restrictions, the sample is reduced to 7,304 respondents.\n\nThe calculations are based on individual and household informa­\n\ntion taken from household and personal surveys. A similar ap­\n\nproach is followed in each of the three areas analyzed: Information \n\nprovided by respondents on how much they spend on and how \n\nmuch they consume of goods whose production results in green­\n\nhouse gases emissions is converted into CO2 equivalents using the \n\ncorresponding emission factors per unit of consumption. Emission \n\nfactors from official sources are used, as the value chains in the \n\nindividual countries differ and the use of national sources is thus \n\nthe most suitable and exact for calculating emissions.1\n\nEmissions from specific areas were calculated as follows: \n\nEmissions caused by energy consumption in private households \n\nare calculated via the type of resource used (electricity, gas, dis­\n\ntrict heating, heating oil, solar energy, ambient heat, wood, coal, \n\n1\t\n\nEmissions factors from the Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control (Bundes­amt \n\nfür Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle) were used for electricity in the area of housing, natural gas, \n\nliquefied gas, local and district heating, coal (average value from hard coal and lignite), heating oil, \n\nbiogas, liquefied petroleum gas, and wood: Bundesamt für Wirtschaft und Ausfuhrkontrolle, Infor­\n\nmationsblatt CO2-Faktoren (2022) (in German; available online). Emissions factors from the Federal \n\nEnvironment Agency are used for diesel and gas: Umweltbundesamt, CO2-Emissionsfaktoren für \n\nfossile Brennstoffe (2022) (in German; available online).\n\nbiomass, and liquefied gas) and the amount of energy used for \n\neach of the resources from the household survey that are used. \n\nTransport emissions were calculated using data on car ownership, \n\nthe type of fuel used, transport expenditure, and the frequency of \n\nlong and short-haul trips via bus, train, tram, and airplane. Nutrition \n\nemissions were calculated using the information provided by re­\n\nspondents on gender, age, weight, and frequency of meat and fish \n\nconsumption.\n\nMissing information on the type of heating is imputed logically, \n\nmeaning it is assumed that a household uses the same type \n\nof heating as they did in the previous survey as long as they have \n\nnot moved. Missing information on housing expenditure or con­\n\nsumption are not imputed. When calculating emissions relating to \n\nnutrition, we assume that the average diet profile of the adults in \n\nthe household applies for the children as well. In the area of trans­\n\nport, the top and bottom one percent are replaced by percentile \n\nboundaries.2\n\nFor each of the three areas, the analyses include all households for \n\nwhich the area-specific information was available. This means the \n\nnumber of cases vary between the individual areas.\n\nData cleaning took place in several phases of the area-specific \n\nemission calculations. In a similar way, we confirmed that all \n\noutliers for each individual area are taken into account. These \n\nprocesses can lead to less pronounced differences in emissions by \n\nincome.\n\n2\t To calculate the percentiles, a data set sorted by size is divided into 100 equal parts. Outliers \n\nwith values larger than the 99th percentile of the sample and smaller than the bottom first percen­\n\ntile are replaced with limit values.\n\n183\n\nDIW Weekly Report 27/2024\n\nCARBON FOOTPRINT\n\nfarming and animal feed production, plant-based foods have \n\na significantly lower carbon footprint. Therefore, the fre­\n\nquency of animal product consumption is an important fac­\n\ntor in individual nutrition-related emissions. Studies show \n\nthat the origin of the food we eat is less important than where \n\nour food comes from, as transportation emissions are signifi­\n\ncantly lower than production-related emissions.12\n\nBased on the respondents’ information on their dietary pref­\n\nerences and weekly frequency of beef, pork, poultry, and \n\nfish consumption, nutrition-related emissions are calcu­\n\nlated in combination with gender and age as indicators for \n\nthe respondents’ necessary caloric intake.13 The diet profiles \n\nare assigned to five categories in accordance with the UBA’s \n\nCO2 calculator: vegan, vegetarian, low-meat, a mix of meat \n\nand plant-based foods, and high-meat diet. A low-meat diet \n\ncorresponds to average meat consumption of 50 grams per \n\nday, while a balanced meat and plant-based foods diet and a \n\nmeat-heavy diet refer to daily meat consumption of 165 grams \n\n12\t Christopher L.

The greatest share of transport-related emissions \n\nis due to flights. Emissions from car trips average 1.0 tCO2e \n\nper capita. An average round-trip flight within Germany \n\ncauses 0.24 tCO2e; for the same amount, a person could \n\ntravel 8,000 kilometers by train.\n\nAccording to the UBA, a domestic or European round-trip \n\nflight emits 0.2 or 0.5 tCO2e, respectively, while an intercon­\n\ntinental round-trip flight emits 4.7 tCO2e.18 Therefore, there \n\nare major differences in transport-related emissions per \n\nperson depending on if and where they fly. While each per­\n\nson in Germany only flies once a year on average, frequent \n\nfliers fly ten or more times per year. People who do not fly \n\nat all have a transport-related carbon footprint of around \n\n1.0 tCO2e (Figure 6), while people who take flights within \n\nEurope emit around 2.3 tCO2e per year according to the cal­\n\nculations. For people who have taken one or more intercon­\n\ntinental round-trip flights, their transport-related emissions \n\nare 9.3 tCO2e on average.\n\nPeople in the highest income decile (the ten percent with \n\nthe highest household incomes) emit seven times as \n\nmuch CO2e as people in the lowest income decile in the \n\narea of transport (Figure 7). Emissions from car trips vary \n\nbetween 0.3 tCO2e for people in the lowest income decile \n\nand 1.4 tCO2e for people in the higher income deciles. At \n\n4.1 tCO2e, flight-related emissions in the highest income \n\ndecile are around ten times higher than in the lowest \n\nincome decile at 0.4 tCO2e. The frequency at which indi­\n\nviduals in the highest income decile fly intercontinentally \n\nresults in their emissions being 40 percent higher than the \n\nemissions of the ninth income decile.\n\nConclusion: Greatest emissions inequality is \n\nin transport\n\nCalculating the greenhouse gas emissions of German \n\nhouseholds that can be attributed to residential energy con­\n\nsumption, nutrition, and transport showed that there are \n\nclear main drivers in each area: For residential energy, it is \n\n18\t Umweltbundesamt, Flugreisen möglichst vermeiden und Alternativen nutzen (2022) (in \n\n­German; available online).\n\nand 290 grams, respectively.14 According to the statistics by \n\nthe Federal Office for Agriculture and Food (Bundesanstalt \n\nfür Landwirtschaft und Ernährung, BLE), a declining trend \n\nin average meat consumption has been observed in recent \n\nyears.15 In 2023, the largest decline was observed in beef \n\nconsumption, which is particularly harmful to the climate.16\n\nOne percent of SOEP respondents indicate they follow a \n\nvegan diet, while 12 percent report following a vegetarian \n\ndiet.17 A high number of the latter nonetheless report eat­\n\ning meat or fish occasionally (less than once a month and \n\nless than two to three times a week, respectively). The large \n\nmajority of the German population follows a low-meat diet \n\n(47 percent) or a diet with a mix of meat and plant-based \n\nfoods (42 percent). Around one in ten respondents reports \n\nto eating meat products several times a day.\n\nPer capita (including children), the average nutrition-related \n\nemissions in Germany are 1.6 tCO2e. A vegetarian diet results \n\nin an average of only 1.2 tCO2e per year (Figure 5). People \n\nwho eat meat less than once a week emit around 1.5 tCO2e \n\n14\t This description is based on the definitions from the UBA, cf. Umweltbundesamt, Mein \n\nCO2-Schnellcheck (in German; available online). The SOEP survey asked about the frequency of \n\nmeat consumption per week or month.

Frequent meat \n\nconsumption is the main driver of nutrition-related green­\n\nhouse gas emissions and flying is the main contributor to \n\ntransport-related emissions. While the income-related differ­\n\nences are small and higher income groups tend to have lower \n\nper capita emissions in the areas of residential energy con­\n\nsumption and nutrition, people from higher-income house­\n\nholds cause significantly more emissions than people from \n\nlower-income households in the area of transport.\n\nTo achieve the goal of carbon neutrality by 2045 as laid out in \n\nthe Federal Climate Change Act, massive individual as well \n\nas political efforts are required: Policymakers must imple­\n\nment and support measures that increase energy efficiency \n\nin residential energy consumption, promote environmental­\n\nly-friendly eating habits, and expand sustainable transport \n\noptions while reducing the emissions-intensive options. In \n\naddition to promoting climate-friendly technologies, their \n\nresearch, and piloting, as well as the economic incentives \n\nand accompanying social compensation measures, regula­\n\ntion-based policy instruments also are needed in the transi­\n\ntion to a low-carbon economy.\n\nThe analyses in this Weekly Report point to a number of pol­\n\nicy measures that foster the ecological transition while taking \n\nsocial justice into account. For example, a thermal insula­\n\ntion strategy for the most inefficient buildings could result \n\nin the most emissions savings and make low-income house­\n\nholds less vulnerable from energy price fluctuations.19 In \n\naddition, using existing housing more efficiently could cre­\n\nate major savings in the building sector. One instrument to \n\nachieve this would be to simplify housing swaps, as was dis­\n\ncussed in the Bundestag in 2023 and as has been enshrined \n\nin Austrian tenancy law since 1982.20 This would not only \n\ncombat the housing shortage, but also reduce greenhouse \n\ngas emissions due to residential energy consumption.\n\nReducing the number of flights offers the greatest potential \n\nfor reducing transport-related emissions. The air traffic tax \n\nincrease effective May 1, 2024, which, if passed on in full to \n\ncustomers, will increase the price of short-haul flight tick­\n\nets by 15 euros and long-haul tickets by 70 euros, is likely \n\nto only have a minor impact on flight demand, especially \n\namong the higher income groups that fly more frequently. \n\nThe French ban on domestic flights over distances that can \n\nbe reached in 2.5 hours by train, which was implemented \n\nat the beginning of 2023 using an environmental protection \n\n19\t Sophie Behr et al., “Thermal retrofitting of worst performing buildings mitigates risk of high \n\nheating costs,” DIW Weekly Report, no. 19/20 (2024) (available online).\n\n20\t Jusline, Gesamte Rechtsvorschriften MRG (2021) (in German; available online).\n\nFigure 7\n\nTransport-related greenhouse gas emissions per capita by \n\nincome decile\n\nIn tons of CO2 equivalents, annual average\n\n1\n\n11111\n\n1st\n\n2nd\n\n3rd\n\n4th\n\n5th\n\n6th\n\n7th\n\n8th\n\n9th\n\nIncome deciles\n\n10th\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n0.3\n\n0.6\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.4\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.9\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n1.3\n\n1.4\n\n1.4\n\n2.0\n\n3.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\nCruise ships\n\nIntercontinental ﬂights\n\nFlights within Europe\n\nFlights within Germany\n\nTrain trips\n\nPublic transport\n\nDiesel and gas\n\nCO2e\n\nSource: Authors’ calculations using preliminary data from the 2023 SOEP survey (v40), weighted with preliminary \n\nweights from wave v39 (2022).\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nThe highest-income group causes seven times as many greenhouse gas emissions \n\nthrough their transport behavior as the poorest ten percent.\n\nFigure 6\n\nTransport-related greenhouse gas emissions per \n\ncapita by air travel behavior\n\nIn tons of CO2 equivalents, annual average\n\n0\n\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\nNo ﬂights\n\nDomestic \n\nﬂights only\n\nAt least one \n\ninner-European \n\nﬂight\n\nAt least one \n\nintercontinental \n\nﬂight\n\n1.0\n\n1.7\n\n2.3\n\n9.3\n\nNote: The vertical black lines show the confidence interval.

A four-person house­\n\nhold generates an average of 1.5 tCO2e per person and year, \n\nwhereas a single-person household generates jus under \n\n4.0 tCO2e per year (Figure 3).\n\nUsing a linear regression model, we investigate he correla­\n\ntion between various household characteristics and residen­\n\ntial energy-related emissions per person (Table). The decisive \n\nfactor is herefore he number of people in he household. In \n\naddition, he living space available per person has a signifi­\n\ncant, albei smaller, influence on emissions: For each addi­\n\ntional square meter of space, emissions per person rise by \n\n0.022 tCO2e per year. These wo factors alone explain nearly \n\nhalf of he observed differences in residential energy-related \n\nemissions per capita. In contrast, he income available per \n\nperson has no significan effec when he factors of people \n\nand space per person are aken into account.\n\nThe ype and age of residential buildings also plays a role: \n\nPeople living in multiple-family residential buildings with \n\nmore han four housing units create around half a on fewer \n\nemissions per person han people living in detached single \n\nor wo-family homes or farming infrastructure (Figure 4). \n\nIn addition, he carbon footprin of people living in newer \n\nbuildings is lower.10 Calculations also show ha he use of \n\nsolar energy decreases he per capita carbon footprin in a \n\nhousehold by around 0.7 tCO2e on average.\n\nMea consumption affects nutrition-related \n\nemissions\n\nAround one quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions can \n\nbe a ributed o food production, in particular from livestock \n\nfarming, fisheries, and land use.11 Compared o livestock \n\n10\t Cf.

Due o \n\nthese restrictions, he sample is reduced o 7,304 respondents.\n\nThe calculations are based on individual and household informa­\n\ntion aken from household and personal surveys.

Emission \n\nfactors from official sources are used, as he value chains in he \n\nindividual countries differ and he use of national sources is hus \n\nthe mos suitable and exac for calculating emissions.1\n\nEmissions from specific areas were calculated as follows: \n\nEmissions caused by energy consumption in private households \n\nare calculated via he ype of resource used (electricity, gas, dis­\n\ntric heating, heating oil, solar energy, ambien heat, wood, coal, \n\n1\t\n\nEmissions factors from he Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Expor Control (Bundes­am \n\nfür Wirtschaf und Ausfuhrkontrolle) were used for electricity in he area of housing, natural gas, \n\nliquefied gas, local and distric heating, coal (average value from hard coal and lignite), heating oil, \n\nbiogas, liquefied petroleum gas, and wood: Bundesam für Wirtschaf und Ausfuhrkontrolle, Infor­\n\nmationsbla CO2-Faktoren (2022) (in German; available online).

Nutrition \n\nemissions were calculated using he information provided by re­\n\nspondents on gender, age, weight, and frequency of mea and fish \n\nconsumption.\n\nMissing information on he ype of heating is imputed logically, \n\nmeaning i is assumed ha a household uses he same ype \n\nof heating as hey did in he previous survey as long as hey have \n\nno moved. Missing information on housing expenditure or con­\n\nsumption are no imputed.

In a similar way, we confirmed ha all \n\noutliers for each individual area are aken into account.
