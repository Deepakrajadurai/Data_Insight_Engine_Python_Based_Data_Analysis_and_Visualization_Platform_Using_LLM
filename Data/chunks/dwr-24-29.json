Katharina Spieß, Katharina Wrohlich, and Elena Ziege ABSTRACT On average, mothers and fathers in Germany divide paid work and care work very unequally. Mothers often only work par time, which results in further gender inequalities in he labor market. A curren analysis of data from he German Family Demography Panel Study (FReDA) shows ha he popula­ tion’s a itudes oward he ideal division of work between couples with children under 12 are considerably more egalitar­ ian han he actual behavior of couples with young children of differen ages. This discrepancy is due in par o he financial incentives of he German ax and ransfer system for married couples, which arise from he interplay between income split­ ting (Ehega enspli ing) and he ax reatmen of mini-jobs. In addition, childcare infrastructure is insufficien and a very high gender pay gap persists in Germany. If policymakers wan o dismantle inequalities in he labor market, he ax and ransfer system mus be modernized and childcare options expanded to make a more equal division of paid work and care work between parents more appealing. In recen years, labor marke gender inequalities have increas­ ingly become he focus of public a ention and hus also of policy discussions. A he same ime, here are few meas­ urable advances in ackling hese inequalities in Germany. For example, he gender pay gap has remained a 18 per­ cent1 for many years and is very high in a European compari­ son.2 Empirical labor marke research shows ha parenthood exacerbates labor marke gender inequalities considerably. Countless studies on wha is known as he “child penalty” have shown ha he gender differences in gross hourly wages and hours worked— and hus gross yearly wages— increase considerably following he birth of a couple’s firs child and remain relatively constan a an older age.3 A major reason for he increase in labor marke gender ine­ qualities is due o paid work and care work: Following he birth of a couple’s firs child, he couple divides paid and care work less equally. For example, here are major differences between mothers and fathers when i comes o parental leave. Although he share of fathers aking parental leave has risen considerably over he pas 15 years, no leas in hanks o he introduction of parental benefits (Elterngeld) in 2007, he major­ ity still do",
    "no ake parental leave. Fathers who do ake paren­ tal leave ake i for significantly shorter periods han mothers.4 Following parental leave, mothers primarily work par ime when hey reenter he labor market, even if hey had worked full ime previously. This is almos never he case for fathers.5 1 Cf.

More han 60 percen of all western German couples whose younges child is of preschool (three o five years old) or primary-school age (six o en years old) divide paid work according o his model (Figure 1), as do nearly fifty per­ cen of couples whose younges child is younger han hree. However, among couples with children in his age group, over 20 percen follow he male breadwinner model, in which he father is employed full ime and he mother does no work a all. In contrast, couples with older chil­ dren are significantly less likely o op for he male bread­ winner model a around only en percent. These figures are based on data from he German Family Demography Panel Study (FReDA), which is representative of he pop­ ulation in Germany aged 18 o 50 (Box 1). Around 12 o 16 percen of all western German couples with children are, depending on he age of he younges child, both employed full ime. Parents choose he adul worker model, in which both parents work full ime, considerably more often han he dual earner/dual carer model,",
    "in which both parents work par ime with around 30 hours a week each: Only hree o five percen of all couples in western Germany follow his model. In eastern Germany he dual earner/dual carer model is also no very widespread. There, both parents work full ime much more frequently han in he west: More han 40 per­ cen of couples whose younges child is hree or older fol­ low he adul worker model, more han wice he number of couples in western Germany. However, for couples whose younges child is younges han hree, he one-and-a-half- earner model is mos widespread in both he eas and west. Population a itudes oward he division of paid and care work are more egalitarian han reality Curren surveys indicate ha he one-and-a-half-earner model and he associated unequal division of paid work and care work between mothers and fathers is no viewed as ideal by a significan share of young families. For example, he German Federal Government’s 2023 Repor on Fathers cites survey results according o which around half of all fathers state ha fathers and mothers should ideally each ake on half of childcare duties. However, his is only actually he case in 21 percen of families. The same survey determined tha more han 40 percen of he fathers surveyed would like to ake on a larger share of childcare han hey actually do.6 6 Cf. Bundesministerium für Familie, Senioren, Frauen und Jugend, Väterrepor 2023: Entwicklun­ gen und Daten zur Vielfal der Väter in Deutschland (2023) (in German; available online). Using he FReDA data, we can analyze in more detail how many hours of parental employment, depending on he age of he younges child, he population heoretically believes is ideal. All FReDA participants are asked, regardless of whether or no hey have children, abou heir a itude oward his opic. Participants are surveyed abou a hypothetical couple whose younges child in he household is wo, four, or eigh years old.7 These a itudes reflec he average social norms ha parents face when deciding on he division of paid work and care work. Analyzing data from 2021 reveals ha he one-and-a-half- earner model is mos frequently viewed as he ideal division of labor between parents. More han 40 percen of respond­ ents in western Germany hink ha he one-and-a-half-earner model is he ideal division of paid work for couples with 7 Cf. also Martin Bujard and Leonie Kleinschrot, \"Wieviel sollten Mü er und Väter arbeiten?

Only 20 percen of he respondents in he eas believe his arrangemen is ideal for couples with older chil­ dren (four or eight) (Figure 2). However, in both eastern and western Germany, he share of families actually following he one-and-a-half-earner model is considerably higher han he share of FReDA respond­ ents with and withou children who hink his model is ideal. While, for example, 63 percen of couples in western Germany whose younges child is between six and en live according o he one-and-a-half-earner model, only 42 percen of western German respondents hink his division of work is ideal for couples with children in his age group. In east­ ern Germany, oo, significantly more couples with children choose he one-and-a-half-earner model han corresponds o the a itudes of young and middle-aged adults: Thirty-eigh percen of couples whose younges child is of primary school age follow his arrangement, bu only 21 percen of eastern German respondents view i as ideal. Respondents in eastern Germany predominantly consider he adul worker model with wo parents working full-time o be ideal as long as he younges child is older han hree. Sixty-two percen of eastern German respondents believe ha his divi­ sion of work is ideal for couples with an eight-year-old child. The share of western German respondents who consider i as ideal is much lower, a 38 percent. However, he share of couples ha pu he adul worker model into practice is sig­ nificantly smaller in both parts of he country: only 16 percen and 43 percen in western and eastern Germany, respectively. Ye he larges discrepancy between general a itudes and actual behaviors can be observed in relation o he dual earner/dual carer model. This arrangement, in which both parents work around 30 hours per week, is practiced by hree Box 1 FReDA: German Family Demography Panel Study The analyses in his Weekly Repor use data from he firs wave of FReDA, he German Family Demography Panel Study1 FReDA is a new panel survey ha began",
    "in 2021. I is a representative sur­ vey of people living in Germany aged 18 o 50 years old and hus focuses on young and middle-aged adults. As par of FReDA, data on partnerships and family life is collected wice a year. An “anchor person” in he household as well as heir partner are surveyed. Overall, more han 30,000 interviews were conducted in fall 2023. FReDA includes questions on numerous demographic, psycholog­ ical, economic, and sociological aspects of life. Special a ention is paid o family planning and forms of cohabitation. Depending on he respondents’ family situation, parent-child relationships or intergenerational relationships are also addressed. The FReDA survey makes i possible o make international comparisons with numerous other countries in Europe and worldwide, as every hree years he questionnaire corresponds o ha of he Generations and Gender Survey (GGS).2 In 2022, he German Family Panel (pairfam) study was integrated into FReDA and continues on in his form. So far, data from he firs wo waves, conducted from 2021 o 2023, are available. The analyses are based on statements of he anchor person on their own employment, he employmen of heir partner, and heir own a itudes oward he employmen of parents from he firs wave in 2021. The question abou heir own employmen was “To wha exten are you employed? Are you...?” Answer options are: • Employed full ime • Employed par ime 1 FReDA stands for Family Research and Demographic Analysis. 2 Cf. he information on he Genations and Gender Survey (GGS) on he website of he Federal Institute for Population Research (Bundesinstituts für Bevölkerungsforschung) (in German; availa- ble online). • Marginally employed, in a mini-job, or a one-euro job The question abou he partner’s employmen is: “Has your partner performed paid work in he pas weeks?” with he following answer options: • Yes, paid work • Yes, paid work, bu hey are on vacation, parental leave, or similar • No, no paid work, bu looking for work • No, no paid work and no looking for work • I don’ know The question “How many hours does your partner normally work per week in his job or in his company, including overtime?” is used for people in paid employmen o differentiate between full- time and part-time employment. Full-time employmen is defined as working 35 hours or more per week. To find ou a itudes oward parental employment, he following question was asked: “Consider a family with a mother, father, and two children where he younges child is wo years old. Should he mother work full ime, par ime, or no work a all?” The question is repeated for he father and in wo other scenarios in which he younges child is four or eigh years old.

    "to six percen of all couples in western and eastern Germany, depending on he age of he child. However, i is viewed as ideal by a significan share of respondents: Around 30 per­ cen of respondents in eastern and western Germany hink tha his is he ideal division of paid work for couples whose younges child is wo years old. If he younges child is four years old, more han 20 percen still consider i best. In he case of an eight-year-old child, 18 percen of respondents in western Germany and 15 percen of respondents in eastern Germany consider he dual earner/dual carer model as ideal. Overall, he analysis shows ha he share of respondents who find an egalitarian division of paid work (either in he adul worker model or he dual earner/dual carer model) o be ideal is considerably higher in eastern Germany, regardless of he age of he younges child, compared o he share of respond­ ents who prefer an unequal division. I is somewha differ­ en in western Germany, where respondents hink he male breadwinner model or one-and-a-half-earner model are he ideal arrangemen for couples whose younges child is either two or four years olds. However, if he younges child is eigh years old or older, he majority of western German respondents also hink ha an egalitarian division of paid work is ideal.8 Tax and ransfer system make he one-and-a-half earner model in particular financially a ractive There are countless individual reasons why he actual divi­ sion of paid and care work within couples deviates so much from he ideal. There may be working conditions ha make i impossible o work he desired number of hours or here may be structural restrictions, such as a lack of childcare spots. In addition, he financial incentives from he ax and rans­ fer system in Germany and he differen average wages of men and women influence couples’ employmen decisions. To illustrate hese financial incentives, we simulate he ne household income of five differen employmen combina­ tions for married couples. We assumed average gross hourly wages for men (25.30 euros) and women (20.80 euros) 9 for the simulations (Box 2). The simulated models are he male breadwinner model (father working full ime, mother unemployed), wo versions of he one-and-a-half-earner model (father working full ime, mother working either 20 hours or only marginally with six hours), he adul worker model (both parents working full time), and he dual earner/dual carer model (both parents working 30 hours a week). 8 Interestingly, men and women’s a itudes oward paid and care work are very similar, regard­ less of he age of he younges child. However, a larger share of women prefer he dual earner/ dual carer model compared o men, who end o prefer he adul worker model. 9 These values represen he average gross hourly wages of men and women in 2023. Cf. Statis­ tisches Bundesamt, “Gender Pay Gap 2023: Frauen verdienten pro Stunde 18 Prozen weniger als Männer.” Monthly ne household income",
    "is highes when both parents work full ime As expected, he ne household income is highes (4,861 euros per month) in he case of he adul worker model in which both parents work full ime (Figure 3). The one-and-a-half- earner model yields he second-highes monthly income (3,953 euros per month), slightly higher han he income from he dual earner/dual carer model (3,832 euros per month), despite he fac ha he parents work he same total number of weekly hours in both. However, because he assumed gross hourly wage of men is 18 percen higher han tha of women (the curren gender pay gap), he one-and-a- half-earner model yields a higher ne income. If he mother is in employmen only marginally for six hours a week, here is a significantly lower ne income of 3,440 per month. As expected, he ne household income is lowes with he male breadwinner model: only 2,941 euros per month.

Thus, he relation between he parents’ com­ bined number of hours worked and ne income is mos a rac­ tive in he one-and-a-half-earner model with he mother in marginal employment. Conclusion: Tax and ransfer system reforms could increase appeal of a more equal division of paid and care work General a itudes oward he division of paid and care work between couples with children deviate considerably from reality. In addition o personal reasons, here are also some structural reasons ha he one-and-a-half-earner model in particular, in which he father works full ime and he mother par ime or marginally, is so common.10 Some of 10 If he mother earns more per hour han he father,",
    "he one-and-a-half-earner model with he roles reversed (the mother working full ime and he father working par ime or a minijob) is also financially appealing. However, his model is empirically very rare. One-and-a-half-earner model mos financially a ractive per hour worked However, he ranking is quite differen when looking a married couples’ ne income per hour worked rather han per month. If we divide he ne household income by he total number of hours worked by both parents, he income from he one-and-a-half-earner model in which he mother is marginally employed (six hours a week) is he highes a 17.30 euros ne per hour. This is closely followed by he male breadwinner model a 17 euros per hour. In he one- and-a-half-earner model in which he mother is employed par ime (20 hours per week) or in he dual earner/dual carer model, in which both parents work 30 hours per week, the ne income per hour worked is significantly lower a 15.20 euros and 14.70 euros per hour, respectively. I is he lowest, 14 euros per hour, when both parents are employed full ime (Figure 4). When using he adul worker model as a reference model and comparing he otal work hours of both parents and he ne household income with he other models, i becomes evident: The one-and-a-half-earner model with he mother employed in a mini-job (six hours a week) results in he household earning 71 percen of he ne income of he reference household, while only having o work 57 percen of he otal hours worked by he reference household. For he one-and-a-half-earner model with the mother in par ime work (20 hours a week), he house­ hold earns 81 percen of he ne income with 75 percen of Box 2 Methodology We calculated he ne incomes of stylized households for differen employmen combinations using he GETTSIM soft­ ware. GETTSIM (GErman Taxes and Transfers SIMulator) is a program ha was jointly developed by researchers a several research institutes and universities in Germany, including DIW Berlin.1 The program is an open-source projec and freely avail­ able o he public.2 GETTSIM can be used for any household situation, employ­ men situation, and income situation o simulate relevan pa­ rameters of he German ax and ransfer system. This includes, for example, households’ ax burden, individual social security contributions, and ransfer payments such as unemployment, child benefits, housing benefits, minimum income benefits (Bürgergeld), and pension entitlements. In his Weekly Report, we simulate he income situation of five households consisting of a married couple with one child each with a differen parental employmen combination. Using GETTSIM, he social security contributions, ax burden, and transfer payments such as child benefits are calculated for these households for 2023 o determine he ne disposable income.

This is due o he interplay of Ehega enspli ing (join axation of married cou­ ples with full income spli ing), he ax reatmen of income from mini-jobs, and non-contributory dependents’ insur­ ance, where spouses can be insured for free on statutory health insurance. Moreover, he gross hourly wage of men, which is 18 percen higher on average, also makes an une­ qual division of paid work more a ractive in he shor erm. If policymakers wan o comba labor marke gender inequal­ ities and he unequal division of unpaid care work, reforms to he ax and ransfer system need o be initiated. Proposals for reforms o Ehega enspli ing, for example in he form of de facto income spli ing with a ransfer amount, have been on he able for some ime.13 Alternatives o non-contributory dependents’ insurance should also be discussed.14 I would 11 Sophia Schmitz et al., Bundesweite Standards für bedarfsgerechte Angebote, insbesondere Ganztagsangebote, in der Kindertagesbetreuung für Kinder bis zum Schuleintri .
