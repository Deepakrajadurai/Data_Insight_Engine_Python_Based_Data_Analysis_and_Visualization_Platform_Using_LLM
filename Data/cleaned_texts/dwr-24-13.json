However, there are neither regulatory nor \n\neconomic incentives for the gas network operators to do so \n\nand delaying the decommissioning could be expensive for the \n\nremaining customers. This Weekly Report analyzes to what \n\nextent municipalities can partially decommission the natural \n\ngas infrastructure with the help of municipal heat planning \n\nand by re-municipalizing the gas industry. This study also \n\noutlines the challenges associated with these instruments. \n\nAccordingly, re-municipalization does not necessarily result \n\nin the gas networks being decommissioned faster, a fact that \n\nremains unconsidered in the existing heat plans. Furthermore, \n\nthe current regulatory framework, which is based on cost effi­\n\nciency and the obligation to connect, makes decommissioning \n\nmore difficult. In addition, the municipalities have a financial \n\nincentive to continue generating revenue from gas, partially \n\nbecause alternative income sources for funding public ser­\n\nvices are unavailable. Thus, the regulation must be adjusted \n\nand the federal and state governments must provide more \n\nsupport for the municipalities in organizing the partial decom­\n\nmissioning of the natural gas infrastructure.\n\nGermany has long relied on natural gas for residential heat­\n\ning. In 2020, the share of natural gas heating was 45 percent, \n\nwith around 522,000 kilometers of natural gas distribution \n\nnetworks in operation.1 Large amounts are invested into net­\n\nwork expansion and maintenance every year: In 2019, the \n\naround 700 gas distribution network operators in Germany2 \n\ninvested 1.5 billion euros in the networks.3\n\nThe Act on Heat Planning and the Decarbonization of \n\nthe Heat Networks (Gesetz für die Wärmeplanung und die \n\nDekarbonisierung der Wärmenetze), which came into force on \n\nJanuary 1, 2024, is meant to accelerate the heat transition. Its \n\naim is a gradual decline in the use of natural gas through \n\nrenovations, increasing electrification, and the expansion \n\nof district heating. Even in scenarios with a high share of \n\nsynthetic gases such as hydrogen, long-term scenarios for \n\nthe energy transition in Germany predict a decline in use \n\nof the gas distribution networks (Figure 1).4 Thus, parts of \n\nthe networks will no longer be able to be operated econom­\n\nically.5 Organizing the decommissioning6 of the natural gas \n\nnetworks and coordinating it with the development of other \n\nenergy networks, such as electricity and district heating, will \n\nbe central to the municipal heat transition.\n\nIn this Weekly Report, different possibilities for dealing with \n\nthe challenges of the heat transition are considered, such as \n\nthe buy-back of natural gas networks or the municipal heat \n\nplans that are now required; to do so, we analyze the heat \n\nplans already in place in some municipalities in Baden-\n\nWürttemberg. This analysis also includes interviews with \n\n1 \n\nBundesnetzagentur and Bundeskartellamt, Monitoringbericht 2020. Report (2021) (in German; \n\navailable online. Accessed on March 5, 2024.

However, this is not \n\nan uncontroversial undertaking. Recently, Hamburg bought \n\nback the energy networks and Berlin is also considering pur­\n\nchasing its local gas utility.7\n\nMunicipalities have various expectations related to re-mu­\n\nnicipalization that may not materialize in practice. On the \n\none hand, they want to accelerate the energy transition and \n\ninfluence the gas utilities accordingly. However, this objec­\n\ntive conflicts with the regulatory framework, which stipulates \n\nan obligation to connect households and, thus, restricts any \n\nnetwork downsizing (Box 1). In addition, the municipalities \n\nwill have to amortize their investments and municipal com­\n\npanies will operate under a profit-oriented approach. The \n\nmore and the longer they sell natural gas, the higher the \n\nprofits. Thus, the financial prospects often get in the way of \n\ntaking climate action.\n\nTwo paths to re-municipalization\n\nMunicipalities have two options for re-municipalizing the \n\nenergy networks. First, a municipality can apply with a \n\nmunicipal company when a new concession is awarded. \n\nThe Energy Industry Act (Energiewirtschaftsgesetz, EnWG) \n\napplies to the selection of the future concession holder when \n\nawarding a new concession (Box 1). The tendering proce­\n\ndure must be non-discriminatory. The municipal company \n\nis not guaranteed to be awarded the concession rights in the \n\ntender procedure. If the concession rights are transferred to \n\nanother company, the former concession holder is entitled \n\nto appropriate remuneration for the network, which can be \n\nbased on future revenue.\n\nAlternatively, municipalities can purchase the gas network \n\noperator that holds the concession rights. The State of Berlin, \n\nfor example, is considering purchasing shares of the gas util­\n\nity Gasag.8 The advantage of this is the continuity of opera­\n\ntions, as the gas utility would remain intact and the knowl­\n\nedge required to operate the network would be retained. \n\nHowever, such a purchase involves risks, as the municipality \n\nwould take on the company’s obligations while future prof­\n\nits are difficult to predict in the transition phase of the heat­\n\ning and energy markets. To determine the purchase price, \n\nmunicipalities must evaluate the energy sector conditions, \n\nsuch as future gas demand, the amount of hydrogen avail­\n\nable regionally, and the expected fuel and carbon prices.\n\n7 Philipp Herpich, Franziska Holz, and Konstantin Löffler, “Wärmewende in Berlin: Versorgungs­\n\nsicherheit nach dem Erdgas mit erneuerbaren Energien gewährleisten,” DIW Wochenbericht no. 49 \n\n(2023) (in German; available online).\n\n8 CDU and SPD, Koalitionsvertrag 2023-2026 (2023). Das Beste für Berlin (in German; \n\navailable online).\n\nThe key assumptions on which a purchase is based should \n\nbe published because such a purchase involves public funds \n\nthat will then be unavailable for the energy transition. It must \n\nbe taken into account that in the future, hydrogen will only \n\nreplace a fraction of the amount of natural gas that is cur­\n\nrently being consumed (Figure 2). There is a broad scien­\n\ntific consensus that hydrogen is not suitable for use in res­\n\nidential heating because it will be scarce, expensive, and \n\ninefficient.9 The political recognition of these problems is \n\nreflected in the National Hydrogen Strategy, which does not \n\n9 Jan Rosenow, “Is heating homes with hydrogen all but a pipe dream?

In contrast, the demand for electricity and district heating will \n\nincrease.\n\n112\n\nDIW Weekly Report 13+14/2024\n\nHEAT TRANSITION\n\nclearly repudiate the use of hydrogen in residential heating \n\nbut recognizes that the use of hydrogen in buildings has \n\nlargely been rejected and will only be considered in a few \n\nindividual cases.10\n\nRe-municipalization: Conflict of interest between \n\nclimate action and profit generation\n\nThe mere political will for re-municipalization is insuffi­\n\ncient. If municipalities are considering re-municipalization, \n\nthe sum they must pay to the former concession holder sig­\n\nnificantly influences the purchase decision. The purchase \n\nprice determines how much natural gas must be sold in the \n\nfuture in order to amortize the investments. In Hamburg, \n\nit took ten years following the purchase to recover one third \n\nof the costs.11\n\nIn the future, however, there will be no time for municipal­\n\nities to amortize the investments. According to climate tar­\n\ngets, carbon emissions must decrease. Thus, natural gas can \n\nonly be delivered until 2045 at the latest and consumption \n\nwill decline well before then. This fact must be reflected in \n\nthe purchase decision and price; otherwise, municipalities \n\n10 Bundesregierung, Fortschreibung der Nationalen Wasserstoffstrategie (2023) (in German; \n\navailable online).\n\n11 Andreas Dassel, Zehn Jahre Rückkauf der Energienetze. Ein Gewinn für Hamburg und das  Klima \n\n(2023) (in German; available online).\n\nwill be paying high sums for fossil infrastructure and will \n\nlack funds in other areas for the energy transition.\n\nIn any case, the decision to re-municipalize should be \n\nincluded in a municipal heat plan that clearly sets out the \n\nremaining gas volumes and provides a framework for the \n\noperation of the remaining network. The heat plan should \n\nalso consider the foreseeable lack of hydrogen and the decline \n\nin heat demand overall (Figure 3).\n\nThe municipalities are experiencing a conflict of interest, \n\nas they must choose between climate action and natural gas \n\nprofits following re-municipalization. In addition, the reg­\n\nulatory framework prescribing a general obligation to con­\n\nnect ensures that decommissioning of parts of the gas net­\n\nwork is hardly possible. This prevents more climate action \n\neven if a  municipal company is operating the gas network. \n\nThese requirements are laid out in the EnWG (Box 1) and \n\nthus cannot be influenced by the municipalities.\n\nMunicipal heat planning should be used to \n\nplan the decommissioning of natural gas \n\ndistribution networks\n\nThe Act on Heat Planning and the Decarbonization of the \n\nHeat Networks came into effect on January 1, 2024.12 Its \n\n12 Heat Planning Act (Wärmeplanungsgesetz), (in German; available online).\n\nBox 1\n\nRegulatory framework for natural gas distribution networks\n\nFrom an economic viewpoint, natural gas networks, like all pipe­\n\nline-based infrastructure, are natural monopolies. This means that \n\nthe construction and operation of one network is more efficient \n\nthan the construction of multiple networks due to the high fixed \n\ncosts and relatively low operating costs. Natural gas networks in \n\nthe European Union are subject to regulation to ensure that nat­\n\nural monopolies do not exploit their advantage at the expense of \n\nconsumers with high prices and low investments.1\n\nThe regulation of the natural gas networks adheres to three basic \n\nprinciples: non-discriminatory access for natural gas sellers to the \n\npipeline network, the unbundling of the network companies from \n\nthe natural gas sellers, and the regulation of network charges and \n\nprofits. A regulatory authority monitors the compliance with these \n\nprinciples; for the distribution network operators, this body is ei­\n\nther the Federal Network Agency or the state regulatory authority. \n\nNetwork fee regulation is mandated in Germany as an incentive \n\nregulation, meaning it aims to provide an incentive for network \n\noperators to operate efficiently.2 To this end, efficiency compar­\n\n1 \n\nImplementation in Germany is regulated in the EnWG.\n\n2 Cf. Regulation on the incentive regulation of the energy supply networks (ARegV) (in German; \n\navailable online); Astrid Cullmann et al., “No Barriers to Investment in Electricity and Gas Distribu­\n\ntion Grids through Incentive Regulation,” DIW Weekly Report no. 6 (2015) (available online).\n\nisons are performed between similar companies.3 The similarity \n\nis determined using structural parameters such as the number \n\nof connections.\n\nThe concession contracts for gas distribution networks are award­\n\ned as an easement contract for an entire municipal area for up to \n\n20 years.4 Concession holders must ensure that gas networks are \n\nsafely operated and expanded, provided this can be done econom­\n\nically. In particular, there is an obligation to fulfill all connection \n\nrequests within the municipality, i.e., to build new pipelines and \n\nconnections if necessary (general obligation to connect).5 The mu­\n\nnicipalities can also take additional local community matters into \n\naccount in the tenders for the concession contracts. However, the \n\nfederal objectives of the obligation to connect and cost efficiency \n\ntake priority over municipal-specific targets such as climate action.\n\n3 In contrast to incentive regulation, pure cost-based regulation (cost-plus regulation) would \n\nstipulate for all costs to be offset and thus provide an incentive for unnecessary investments.\n\n4 Section 46 of the EnWG.\n\n5 Section 18 of the EnWG.\n\n113\n\nDIW Weekly Report 13+14/2024\n\nHEAT TRANSITION\n\naim is to make the heat supply greenhouse gas neutral and \n\nto  provide support in achieving climate targets by 2045. \n\nIt requires all municipalities in Germany with more than \n\n100,000 inhabitants to develop a heat plan by mid-2026. All \n\nmunicipalities with fewer than 100,000 inhabitants have until \n\nmid-2028 to carry out their heat planning and municipali­\n\nties with fewer than 10,000 inhabitants are subject to sim­\n\nplified planning requirements. The planning process con­\n\ntains seven steps, and the plan must be reviewed or contin­\n\nued every five years (Figure 4). Various stakeholders, such as \n\nnatural gas or heat network operators and representatives of \n\npublic interests, are to be involved in the process.\n\nThe Heat Planning Act provides access to previously un avail­\n\nable data, for example data from energy companies and the \n\nassociations of the craftsman and chimney sweeps, about con­\n\nnections to the natural gas network, heating systems, or con­\n\nsumption. This new data makes it possible for municipalities \n\nto take a leading role in heat planning and its coordination.\n\nHeat planning can contribute to overcoming the insuffi­\n\ncient planning for the heat transition, to creating investment \n\nsecurity for renewable energy infrastructure and to adjust­\n\ning consumers’ expectations. Ideally, heat plans would con­\n\ntain clear statements on the medium and long-term natu­\n\nral gas  coverage of a neighborhood. Natural gas customers \n\nwould then know by when they would have to replace their \n\ngas heating and natural gas network operators would be able \n\nto make their investments with foresight and make targeted \n\ninvestments in maintenance where the networks are in oper­\n\nation for longer.13 Such a planned approach to the decommis­\n\nsioning of the gas distribution networks is recommended \n\nbut not required in the Heat Planning Act. The following \n\n analysis of municipal heat planning in some municipali­\n\nties in Baden-Württemberg shows that the municipalities \n\ncannot be expected to directly address natural gas grids and \n\ntheir decommissioning in their heat planning.\n\nBaden-Württemberg has already implemented \n\nmunicipal heat planning\n\nThe first state in Germany to implement heat planning was \n\nBaden-Württemberg, where it has been mandatory for large \n\nmunicipalities since December 2020. Its municipalities must \n\npresent their heat plans by the end of 2023. An evaluation \n\nof these initial experiences in Baden-Württemberg provides \n\ninsights into implementation that is relevant for the rest of \n\nGermany. The data for this analysis are from interviews with \n\n20 representatives of the most important interest groups of \n\nthe heat transition in Baden-Württemberg as well as five sci­\n\nentific experts.14 Representatives of public utilities, network \n\n13 When planning the gradual decommissoning, risk-determining factors should be taken into \n\naccount, such as the age of the network, high upcoming maintenance investments, the expected \n\ndecline in gas consumption due to district modernization, the advanced age of the gas boilers, an­\n\nchor customers for district heating, and upcoming civil engineering measures that could favor the \n\nrelocation of heating networks.\n\n14 The detailed evaluation of the interviews is available in Isabell Branger, “Communal heat plan­\n\nning: Overcoming the path-dependency of natural gas in residential heating?” Environmental Inno­\n\nvation and Societal Transitions, Vol. 48 (2023): 100768 (available online).\n\nFigure 2\n\nLong-term forecast of natural gas and hydrogen demand in \n\nBerlin’s climate neutrality strategy \n\nIn petajoules\n\n \n\nSources: The Institute for Ecological Economy Research (IÖW) on behalf of the Berlin Senate Department for Urban \n\nMobility, Transport, Climate Action and the Environment; authors’ depiction.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nRenewable hydrogen will only be available in limited amounts in the future and will \n\nbarely replace natural gas in the pipelines.\n\nFigure 3\n\nLong-term forecast of demand for natural gas and hydrogen in \n\nthe building sector in Germany\n\nIn terawatt hours\n\n \n\nSources: Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (2021); authors’ depiction.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nExcept in an extreme scenario, gas demand will decline considerably by 2045. Hy­\n\ndrogen will not play a role in the building sector.\n\n114\n\nDIW Weekly Report 13+14/2024\n\nHEAT TRANSITION\n\nUncertainty is only one reason why municipalities in Baden-\n\nWürttemberg are not sufficiently taking into account the \n\ndecommissioning of the natural gas distribution networks. \n\nMunicipalities also face economic and regulatory barriers \n\nduring planning and implementation. While the results \n\nare from interviews conducted in Baden-Württemberg, they \n\nprovide insights into the framework conditions that apply \n\nnationwide and are thus formulated generally and relevant \n\nfor municipalities in other German states.\n\nDecommissioning natural gas networks reduces \n\nmunicipal revenues\n\nSo far, the business models of municipal energy and heat \n\nutilities have been significantly based on the sales of natu­\n\nral gas.16 In 2017, public utilities employed three times more \n\nemployees in natural gas operations than in district heating \n\noperations;17 it can be assumed that this ratio has not changed \n\nmuch over the past years. Utilities must develop new com­\n\npetencies, strategies, and business models for the heat tran­\n\nsition. The interviews show that adjusting business models \n\ncan lead to conflicting objectives, especially when it comes \n\nto expanding district heating in areas with an existing nat­\n\nural gas network.\n\nIndeed, in many municipalities, the profits of the public gas \n\nutilities have been used to cross-finance other public servic­\n\nes.18 A decline in profits from a municipal gas utility could \n\nlead to financial challenges for the municipalities.19\n\nIf the natural gas network belongs to a private operator, the \n\nmunicipal budget loses out on income from concession \n\nfees.20 Concession fees are an important source of revenue, \n\nespecially for smaller municipalities. Many municipalities, \n\ntherefore, have little interest in the end of the natural gas sec­\n\ntor, as one of the interviewees pointed out. At the same time, \n\nthe municipalities have the opportunity to take an active role \n\nin designing municipal heat planning.\n\nPartial decommissioning of natural gas \n\ninfrastructure is limited by existing regulation\n\nThe existing (incentive) regulation of natural gas distribu­\n\ntion networks is designed to expand and maintain the net­\n\nworks, while reducing the size of the networks has not been \n\n possible to date. As long as there are even isolated connec­\n\ntions, existing networks must remain in operation.21\n\n16 Isabel Schrems and Lorena Eulgem, Die Rolle des Erdgasgeschäfts von Stadtwerken für die \n\nkommunale Daseinsvorsorge – Eine Fallstudienanalyse (2022) (in German; available online).\n\n17 Thomas Bruckner et al., “Kommunale Energieversorger: Gewinner oder Verlierer der Energie­\n\nwende?” Wiso Diskurs 04 (2017) (in German; available online).\n\n18 Cf. Bruckner et al., “Kommunale Energieversorger.”\n\n19 Schrems and Eulgem, Die Rolle des Erdgasgeschäfts von Stadtwerken für die kommunale Da­\n\nseinsvorsorge.\n\n20 Municipal network operators pay concession fees too. However, they are deducted from the \n\nprofits of the municipal company and reduce the amount of revenue that can be used to finance \n\npublic services.\n\n21 Energiewirtschaftsgesetz, EnWG, sections 11, 17, 18, and 20 (in German; available online).\n\noperators, energy agencies, and the State Ministry of Food, \n\nRural Affairs and Consumer Protection were interviewed \n\n(Box 2). In addition, six published heat plans from munici­\n\npalities in Baden-Württemberg were analyzed.\n\nHeat plans do not sufficiently consider the decline \n\nof natural gas consumption\n\nThe evaluation of heat plans from Baden-Württemberg shows \n\nthat they have not sufficiently taken into account the need to \n\ndecommission natural gas distribution networks. Concrete \n\ndecommissioning plans, for example by classifying priority \n\nareas, are not included in the heat plans. The plans do not \n\nexplicitly state when the natural gas distribution networks \n\nare likely to be decommissioned, even for areas designated \n\nas priority areas for district heating supply. The actors ascribe \n\nthis to a high level of uncertainty regarding the future avail­\n\nability of renewable gases such as hydrogen.15 As a result, \n\nnatural gas customers remain unsure as to how long they \n\nwill be able to continue to operate their gas heating despite \n\nthe existing heat plans.\n\n15 See, for example, the municipal heat plan of the Landkreis Lörrach (in German; available on-\n\nline).\n\nBox 2\n\nAnalysis of actors in Baden-Württemberg\n\nThe data for this analysis come from interviews with 20 rep­\n\nresentatives of the most important interest groups of the heat \n\ntransition in Baden-Württemberg as well as five scientific ex­\n\nperts. Among those interviewed were representatives of public \n\nutilities, network operators, energy agencies, municipal actors, \n\nand the State Ministry of Food, Rural Affairs and Consumer \n\nProtection. The semi-structured interviews were conducted \n\nbetween October and December 2021 and evaluated using a \n\nqualitative content analysis.1\n\nIn addition, six heat plans from Baden-Württemberg were \n\nanalyzed from the municipalities of Lörrach, Freiburg, Giengen, \n\nBaden-Baden, Obersontheim, and Kirchheim-Unterteck. The \n\nmunicipal heat plans for these municipalities were completed \n\nand available online by the end of 2023. The analysis is based \n\non a matrix that focuses on the future development of the gas \n\nnetwork in the heat plan and investigates different qualitative \n\ndimensions. These dimensions include defining areas with \n\ndeclining gas demand, identifying and explaining the risk \n\nfactors involved in decommissioning the gas network, and \n\ndeveloping concrete measures for decommissioning. In addi­\n\ntion, where available, the more general discussion of the issue \n\nwas evaluated.\n\n1 \n\nJochen Gläser and Grit Laudel, Experteninterviews und qualitative Inhaltsanalyse: als \n\nInstrumente rekonstruierender Untersuchungen, 4th ed. (2010: VS Verlag für Sozialwissen­\n\nschaften) (in German; available online).\n\n115\n\nDIW Weekly Report 13+14/2024\n\nHEAT TRANSITION\n\nThe maintenance and operation costs of the networks are \n\npassed on to the connected gas customers. If customers suc­\n\ncessively switch to a renewable heat supply in the future, the \n\nnetwork charges will increase for the ever-fewer remaining \n\ngas customers.22 This could reduce the acceptance of the \n\nheat transition, for example among renters who do not have \n\na choice in their heating system and are forced to assume \n\nthe rising network charges.\n\nThe concession contracts between municipalities and gas net­\n\nwork operators set the framework for developments in the \n\nnetwork. However, municipalities have very little influence \n\non large parts of the content of the concession contracts. The \n\nconcession area always covers the entire municipal area by \n\nlaw and reducing it, for example due to the municipal heat \n\nplan, is not possible. Concessions are awarded exclusively \n\naccording to legally defined economic criteria, while criteria \n\nsuch as climate action have previously not been permitted.23\n\nAccording to the EnWG, gas distribution network operators \n\nmust amortize the networks over 45 to 55 years.24 Premature \n\ndecommissioning leads to uncovered investment costs and \n\nrequires value adjustments, leaving companies with stranded \n\n22 Agora Energiewende, Ein neuer Ordnungsrahmen für die Erdgasverteilnetze (2023) (in German; \n\navailable online).\n\n23 Julian Senders, “Wärmeplanung und Gaskonzessionen: Eine Untersuchung der bestehenden \n\nkommunalen Spielräume in der Wärmeplanung unter besonderer Berücksichtigung von Wärme­\n\nnetzen,” Würzburger Studien zum Umweltenergierecht, no. 27 (2022) (in German; available online).\n\n24 Section 46 of the EnWG.\n\nassets on their balance sheets.25 In Germany, 55 percent of the \n\npipelines were built or renewed between 1990 and 2020; they \n\nwould be only partially depreciated by 2045.26 The Federal \n\nNetwork Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) has recognized the \n\nneed to adjust the expected operating life and depreciation \n\nprocedures and has begun a consultation process to do so.27 \n\nThis is an important step in advancing the decommission­\n\ning of the natural gas distribution network.\n\nHeat planning process must be improved\n\nThe statutory obligation of heat planning creates a responsi­\n\nbility in the municipalities to coordinate the heat transition. \n\nIn the interviews, however, various stakeholders pointed out \n\nthat staffing levels are low in most municipalities and that the \n\ndevelopment of additional capacities is not sufficiently guar­\n\nanteed due to low compensation funding for the heat plan­\n\nning.

In the interviews, civil society actors described \n\nthe process as opaque due to the lack of participation oppor­\n\ntunities. A major advantage of municipal heat planning is \n\nthat both specialists and the general public can be involved, \n\nthereby creating acceptance for the transition at an early \n\nstage. Therefore, municipalities should be encouraged and \n\nsupported as much as possible in exploiting this advantage.\n\nConclusion: Timely decommissioning of the \n\nnetwork not yet guaranteed\n\nThe demand for natural gas for residential heating will \n\ndecline over the next years. Natural gas distribution net­\n\nworks must be gradually decommissioned so that network \n\ncharges do not become too expensive for the few remain­\n\ning customers. Municipal heat planning is a first important \n\nstep in accelerating the heat transition and is, in theory, a \n\ngood instrument for planning the decommissioning of nat­\n\nural gas distribution networks. However, the evaluation of \n\nthe first heat plans shows that the municipalities are ignor­\n\ning the future of gas networks, citing major uncertainties. In \n\naddition, neither municipal nor private gas network owners \n\nhave any economic interest in decommissioning, nor have \n\nthere been any regulatory incentives to do so. The EnWG \n\nprioritizes cost efficiency and the obligation to connect over \n\nclimate action. However, climate action should be placed on \n\nequal footing with these other objectives in order to make \n\nit possible to decommission the gas distribution networks. \n\nThe consultation on the future of the natural gas distribu­\n\ntion networks launched by the German government in March \n\n2024 and parallel processes at the Federal Network Agency \n\nare steps in the right direction.28\n\nMunicipal owners are facing the same limitations due to \n\nregulations and a lack of economic incentives, which make \n\ndecommissioning natural gas networks hard. The re-mu­\n\nnicipalization of gas networks that were previously privately \n\nowned is thus not a necessary prerequisite to making the \n\nheat supply climate-friendly. Municipalities and public util­\n\nities will need support services in the future to adequately \n\ncompensate for the decline in the natural gas demand. Such \n\nsupport can include, for example, the development of new \n\nfinancing concepts for the provision of public services. In \n\naddition, municipalities should be encouraged to develop a \n\nclear roadmap for the existing natural gas distribution net­\n\nwork infrastructure, even if this has not yet been explicitly \n\nrequired in the Heat Planning Act.\n\n28 Cf.

However, here are neither regulatory nor \n\neconomic incentives for he gas network operators o do so \n\nand delaying he decommissioning could be expensive for he \n\nremaining customers. This Weekly Repor analyzes o wha \n\nexten municipalities can partially decommission he natural \n\ngas infrastructure with he help of municipal hea planning \n\nand by re-municipalizing he gas industry. This study also \n\noutlines he challenges associated with hese instruments. \n\nAccordingly, re-municipalization does no necessarily resul \n\nin he gas networks being decommissioned faster, a fac ha \n\nremains unconsidered in he existing hea plans. Furthermore, \n\nthe curren regulatory framework, which is based on cos effi­\n\nciency and he obligation o connect, makes decommissioning \n\nmore difficult. In addition, he municipalities have a financial \n\nincentive o continue generating revenue from gas, partially \n\nbecause alternative income sources for funding public ser­\n\nvices are unavailable. Thus, he regulation mus be adjusted \n\nand he federal and state governments mus provide more \n\nsuppor for he municipalities in organizing he partial decom­\n\nmissioning of he natural gas infrastructure.\n\nGermany has long relied on natural gas for residential heat­\n\ning. In 2020, he share of natural gas heating was 45 percent, \n\nwith around 522,000 kilometers of natural gas distribution \n\nnetworks in operation.1 Large amounts are invested into net­\n\nwork expansion and maintenance every year: In 2019, he \n\naround 700 gas distribution network operators in Germany2 \n\ninvested 1.5 billion euros in he networks.3\n\nThe Ac on Hea Planning and he Decarbonization of \n\nthe Hea Networks (Gesetz für die Wärmeplanung und die \n\nDekarbonisierung der Wärmenetze), which came into force on \n\nJanuary 1, 2024, is mean o accelerate he hea ransition. Its \n\naim is a gradual decline in he use of natural gas hrough \n\nrenovations, increasing electrification, and he expansion \n\nof distric heating. Even in scenarios with a high share of \n\nsynthetic gases such as hydrogen, long-term scenarios for \n\nthe energy ransition in Germany predic a decline in use \n\nof he gas distribution networks (Figure 1).4 Thus, parts of \n\nthe networks will no longer be able o be operated econom­\n\nically.5 Organizing he decommissioning6 of he natural gas \n\nnetworks and coordinating i with he developmen of other \n\nenergy networks, such as electricity and distric heating, will \n\nbe central o he municipal hea ransition.\n\nIn his Weekly Report, differen possibilities for dealing with \n\nthe challenges of he hea ransition are considered, such as \n\nthe buy-back of natural gas networks or he municipal hea \n\nplans ha are now required; o do so, we analyze he hea \n\nplans already in place in some municipalities in Baden-\n\nWür emberg. This analysis also includes interviews with \n\n1 \n\nBundesnetzagentur and Bundeskartellamt, Monitoringberich 2020. Repor (2021) (in German; \n\navailable online. Accessed on March 5, 2024.

However, his is no \n\nan uncontroversial undertaking. Recently, Hamburg bough \n\nback he energy networks and Berlin is also considering pur­\n\nchasing its local gas utility.7\n\nMunicipalities have various expectations related o re-mu­\n\nnicipalization ha may no materialize in practice. On he \n\none hand, hey wan o accelerate he energy ransition and \n\ninfluence he gas utilities accordingly. However, his objec­\n\ntive conflicts with he regulatory framework, which stipulates \n\nan obligation o connec households and, hus, restricts any \n\nnetwork downsizing (Box 1). In addition, he municipalities \n\nwill have o amortize heir investments and municipal com­\n\npanies will operate under a profit-oriented approach. The \n\nmore and he longer hey sell natural gas, he higher he \n\nprofits. Thus, he financial prospects often ge in he way of \n\ntaking climate action.\n\nTwo paths o re-municipalization\n\nMunicipalities have wo options for re-municipalizing he \n\nenergy networks. First, a municipality can apply with a \n\nmunicipal company when a new concession is awarded. \n\nThe Energy Industry Ac (Energiewirtschaftsgesetz, EnWG) \n\napplies o he selection of he future concession holder when \n\nawarding a new concession (Box 1). The endering proce­\n\ndure mus be non-discriminatory. The municipal company \n\nis no guaranteed o be awarded he concession rights in he \n\ntender procedure. If he concession rights are ransferred o \n\nanother company, he former concession holder is entitled \n\nto appropriate remuneration for he network, which can be \n\nbased on future revenue.\n\nAlternatively, municipalities can purchase he gas network \n\noperator ha holds he concession rights. The State of Berlin, \n\nfor example, is considering purchasing shares of he gas util­\n\nity Gasag.8 The advantage of his is he continuity of opera­\n\ntions, as he gas utility would remain intac and he knowl­\n\nedge required o operate he network would be retained. \n\nHowever, such a purchase involves risks, as he municipality \n\nwould ake on he company’s obligations while future prof­\n\nits are difficul o predic in he ransition phase of he heat­\n\ning and energy markets. To determine he purchase price, \n\nmunicipalities mus evaluate he energy sector conditions, \n\nsuch as future gas demand, he amoun of hydrogen avail­\n\nable regionally, and he expected fuel and carbon prices.\n\n7 Philipp Herpich, Franziska Holz, and Konstantin Löffler, “Wärmewende in Berlin: Versorgungs­\n\nsicherhei nach dem Erdgas mi erneuerbaren Energien gewährleisten,” DIW Wochenberich no. 49 \n\n(2023) (in German; available online).\n\n8 CDU and SPD, Koalitionsvertrag 2023-2026 (2023).

I mus \n\nbe aken into accoun ha in he future, hydrogen will only \n\nreplace a fraction of he amoun of natural gas ha is cur­\n\nrently being consumed (Figure 2). There is a broad scien­\n\ntific consensus ha hydrogen is no suitable for use in res­\n\nidential heating because i will be scarce, expensive, and \n\ninefficient.9 The political recognition of hese problems is \n\nreflected in he National Hydrogen Strategy, which does no \n\n9 Jan Rosenow, “Is heating homes with hydrogen all bu a pipe dream?

If municipalities are considering re-municipalization, \n\nthe sum hey mus pay o he former concession holder sig­\n\nnificantly influences he purchase decision. The purchase \n\nprice determines how much natural gas mus be sold in he \n\nfuture in order o amortize he investments. In Hamburg, \n\ni ook en years following he purchase o recover one hird \n\nof he costs.11\n\nIn he future, however, here will be no ime for municipal­\n\nities o amortize he investments. According o climate ar­\n\ngets, carbon emissions mus decrease. Thus, natural gas can \n\nonly be delivered until 2045 a he lates and consumption \n\nwill decline well before hen. This fac mus be reflected in \n\nthe purchase decision and price; otherwise, municipalities \n\n10 Bundesregierung, Fortschreibung der Nationalen Wasserstoffstrategie (2023) (in German; \n\navailable online).\n\n11 Andreas Dassel, Zehn Jahre Rückkauf der Energienetze. Ein Gewinn für Hamburg und das Klima \n\n(2023) (in German; available online).\n\nwill be paying high sums for fossil infrastructure and will \n\nlack funds in other areas for he energy ransition.\n\nIn any case, he decision o re-municipalize should be \n\nincluded in a municipal hea plan ha clearly sets ou he \n\nremaining gas volumes and provides a framework for he \n\noperation of he remaining network. The hea plan should \n\nalso consider he foreseeable lack of hydrogen and he decline \n\nin hea demand overall (Figure 3).\n\nThe municipalities are experiencing a conflic of interest, \n\nas hey mus choose between climate action and natural gas \n\nprofits following re-municipalization. In addition, he reg­\n\nulatory framework prescribing a general obligation o con­\n\nnec ensures ha decommissioning of parts of he gas net­\n\nwork is hardly possible. This prevents more climate action \n\neven if a municipal company is operating he gas network. \n\nThese requirements are laid ou in he EnWG (Box 1) and \n\nthus canno be influenced by he municipalities.\n\nMunicipal hea planning should be used o \n\nplan he decommissioning of natural gas \n\ndistribution networks\n\nThe Ac on Hea Planning and he Decarbonization of he \n\nHea Networks came into effec on January 1, 2024.12 Its \n\n12 Hea Planning Ac (Wärmeplanungsgesetz), (in German; available online).\n\nBox 1\n\nRegulatory framework for natural gas distribution networks\n\nFrom an economic viewpoint, natural gas networks, like all pipe­\n\nline-based infrastructure, are natural monopolies. This means ha \n\nthe construction and operation of one network is more efficien \n\nthan he construction of multiple networks due o he high fixed \n\ncosts and relatively low operating costs. Natural gas networks in \n\nthe European Union are subjec o regulation o ensure ha nat­\n\nural monopolies do no exploi heir advantage a he expense of \n\nconsumers with high prices and low investments.1\n\nThe regulation of he natural gas networks adheres o hree basic \n\nprinciples: non-discriminatory access for natural gas sellers o he \n\npipeline network, he unbundling of he network companies from \n\nthe natural gas sellers, and he regulation of network charges and \n\nprofits. A regulatory authority monitors he compliance with hese \n\nprinciples; for he distribution network operators, his body is ei­\n\nther he Federal Network Agency or he state regulatory authority. \n\nNetwork fee regulation is mandated in Germany as an incentive \n\nregulation, meaning i aims o provide an incentive for network \n\noperators o operate efficiently.2 To his end, efficiency compar­\n\n1 \n\nImplementation in Germany is regulated in he EnWG.\n\n2 Cf. Regulation on he incentive regulation of he energy supply networks (ARegV) (in German; \n\navailable online); Astrid Cullmann e al., “No Barriers o Investmen in Electricity and Gas Distribu­\n\ntion Grids hrough Incentive Regulation,” DIW Weekly Repor no. 6 (2015) (available online).\n\nisons are performed between similar companies.3 The similarity \n\nis determined using structural parameters such as he number \n\nof connections.\n\nThe concession contracts for gas distribution networks are award­\n\ned as an easemen contrac for an entire municipal area for up o \n\n20 years.4 Concession holders mus ensure ha gas networks are \n\nsafely operated and expanded, provided his can be done econom­\n\nically. In particular, here is an obligation o fulfill all connection \n\nrequests within he municipality, i.e., o build new pipelines and \n\nconnections if necessary (general obligation o connect).5 The mu­\n\nnicipalities can also ake additional local community ma ers into \n\naccoun in he enders for he concession contracts. However, he \n\nfederal objectives of he obligation o connec and cos efficiency \n\ntake priority over municipal-specific argets such as climate action.\n\n3 In contras o incentive regulation, pure cost-based regulation (cost-plus regulation) would \n\nstipulate for all costs o be offse and hus provide an incentive for unnecessary investments.\n\n4 Section 46 of he EnWG.\n\n5 Section 18 of he EnWG.\n\n113\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 13+14/2024\n\nHEAT TRANSITION\n\naim is o make he hea supply greenhouse gas neutral and \n\nto provide suppor in achieving climate argets by 2045. \n\nI requires all municipalities in Germany with more han \n\n100,000 inhabitants o develop a hea plan by mid-2026. All \n\nmunicipalities with fewer han 100,000 inhabitants have until \n\nmid-2028 o carry ou heir hea planning and municipali­\n\nties with fewer han 10,000 inhabitants are subjec o sim­\n\nplified planning requirements. The planning process con­\n\ntains seven steps, and he plan mus be reviewed or contin­\n\nued every five years (Figure 4). Various stakeholders, such as \n\nnatural gas or hea network operators and representatives of \n\npublic interests, are o be involved in he process.\n\nThe Hea Planning Ac provides access o previously un avail­\n\nable data, for example data from energy companies and he \n\nassociations of he craftsman and chimney sweeps, abou con­\n\nnections o he natural gas network, heating systems, or con­\n\nsumption. This new data makes i possible for municipalities \n\nto ake a leading role in hea planning and its coordination.\n\nHea planning can contribute o overcoming he insuffi­\n\ncien planning for he hea ransition, o creating investmen \n\nsecurity for renewable energy infrastructure and o adjust­\n\ning consumers’ expectations. Ideally, hea plans would con­\n\ntain clear statements on he medium and long-term natu­\n\nral gas coverage of a neighborhood. Natural gas customers \n\nwould hen know by when hey would have o replace heir \n\ngas heating and natural gas network operators would be able \n\nto make heir investments with foresigh and make argeted \n\ninvestments in maintenance where he networks are in oper­\n\nation for longer.13 Such a planned approach o he decommis­\n\nsioning of he gas distribution networks is recommended \n\nbu no required in he Hea Planning Act. The following \n\n analysis of municipal hea planning in some municipali­\n\nties in Baden-Wür emberg shows ha he municipalities \n\ncanno be expected o directly address natural gas grids and \n\ntheir decommissioning in heir hea planning.\n\nBaden-Wür emberg has already implemented \n\nmunicipal hea planning\n\nThe firs state in Germany o implemen hea planning was \n\nBaden-Wür emberg, where i has been mandatory for large \n\nmunicipalities since December 2020.

An evaluation \n\nof hese initial experiences in Baden-Wür emberg provides \n\ninsights into implementation ha is relevan for he res of \n\nGermany.

While he results \n\nare from interviews conducted in Baden-Wür emberg, hey \n\nprovide insights into he framework conditions ha apply \n\nnationwide and are hus formulated generally and relevan \n\nfor municipalities in other German states.\n\nDecommissioning natural gas networks reduces \n\nmunicipal revenues\n\nSo far, he business models of municipal energy and hea \n\nutilities have been significantly based on he sales of natu­\n\nral gas.16 In 2017, public utilities employed hree imes more \n\nemployees in natural gas operations han in distric heating \n\noperations;17 i can be assumed ha his ratio has no changed \n\nmuch over he pas years. Utilities mus develop new com­\n\npetencies, strategies, and business models for he hea ran­\n\nsition. The interviews show ha adjusting business models \n\ncan lead o conflicting objectives, especially when i comes \n\nto expanding distric heating in areas with an existing nat­\n\nural gas network.\n\nIndeed, in many municipalities, he profits of he public gas \n\nutilities have been used o cross-finance other public servic­\n\nes.18 A decline in profits from a municipal gas utility could \n\nlead o financial challenges for he municipalities.19\n\nIf he natural gas network belongs o a private operator, he \n\nmunicipal budge loses ou on income from concession \n\nfees.20 Concession fees are an importan source of revenue, \n\nespecially for smaller municipalities. Many municipalities, \n\ntherefore, have li le interes in he end of he natural gas sec­\n\ntor, as one of he interviewees pointed out. A he same ime, \n\nthe municipalities have he opportunity o ake an active role \n\nin designing municipal hea planning.\n\nPartial decommissioning of natural gas \n\ninfrastructure is limited by existing regulation\n\nThe existing (incentive) regulation of natural gas distribu­\n\ntion networks is designed o expand and maintain he net­\n\nworks, while reducing he size of he networks has no been \n\n possible o date. As long as here are even isolated connec­\n\ntions, existing networks mus remain in operation.21\n\n16 Isabel Schrems and Lorena Eulgem, Die Rolle des Erdgasgeschäfts von Stadtwerken für die \n\nkommunale Daseinsvorsorge – Eine Fallstudienanalyse (2022) (in German; available online).\n\n17 Thomas Bruckner e al., “Kommunale Energieversorger: Gewinner oder Verlierer der Energie­\n\nwende?” Wiso Diskurs 04 (2017) (in German; available online).\n\n18 Cf.

However, hey are deducted from he \n\nprofits of he municipal company and reduce he amoun of revenue ha can be used o finance \n\npublic services.\n\n21 Energiewirtschaftsgesetz, EnWG, sections 11, 17, 18, and 20 (in German; available online).\n\noperators, energy agencies, and he State Ministry of Food, \n\nRural Affairs and Consumer Protection were interviewed \n\n(Box 2). In addition, six published hea plans from munici­\n\npalities in Baden-Wür emberg were analyzed.\n\nHea plans do no sufficiently consider he decline \n\nof natural gas consumption\n\nThe evaluation of hea plans from Baden-Wür emberg shows \n\ntha hey have no sufficiently aken into accoun he need o \n\ndecommission natural gas distribution networks. Concrete \n\ndecommissioning plans, for example by classifying priority \n\nareas, are no included in he hea plans. The plans do no \n\nexplicitly state when he natural gas distribution networks \n\nare likely o be decommissioned, even for areas designated \n\nas priority areas for distric heating supply. The actors ascribe \n\nthis o a high level of uncertainty regarding he future avail­\n\nability of renewable gases such as hydrogen.15 As a result, \n\nnatural gas customers remain unsure as o how long hey \n\nwill be able o continue o operate heir gas heating despite \n\nthe existing hea plans.\n\n15 See, for example, he municipal hea plan of he Landkreis Lörrach (in German; available on-\n\nline).\n\nBox 2\n\nAnalysis of actors in Baden-Wür emberg\n\nThe data for his analysis come from interviews with 20 rep­\n\nresentatives of he mos importan interes groups of he hea \n\ntransition in Baden-Wür emberg as well as five scientific ex­\n\nperts. Among hose interviewed were representatives of public \n\nutilities, network operators, energy agencies, municipal actors, \n\nand he State Ministry of Food, Rural Affairs and Consumer \n\nProtection. The semi-structured interviews were conducted \n\nbetween October and December 2021 and evaluated using a \n\nqualitative conten analysis.1\n\nIn addition, six hea plans from Baden-Wür emberg were \n\nanalyzed from he municipalities of Lörrach, Freiburg, Giengen, \n\nBaden-Baden, Obersontheim, and Kirchheim-Unterteck. The \n\nmunicipal hea plans for hese municipalities were completed \n\nand available online by he end of 2023. The analysis is based \n\non a matrix ha focuses on he future developmen of he gas \n\nnetwork in he hea plan and investigates differen qualitative \n\ndimensions. These dimensions include defining areas with \n\ndeclining gas demand, identifying and explaining he risk \n\nfactors involved in decommissioning he gas network, and \n\ndeveloping concrete measures for decommissioning. In addi­\n\ntion, where available, he more general discussion of he issue \n\nwas evaluated.\n\n1 \n\nJochen Gläser and Gri Laudel, Experteninterviews und qualitative Inhaltsanalyse: als \n\nInstrumente rekonstruierender Untersuchungen, 4th ed.

If customers suc­\n\ncessively switch o a renewable hea supply in he future, he \n\nnetwork charges will increase for he ever-fewer remaining \n\ngas customers.22 This could reduce he acceptance of he \n\nhea ransition, for example among renters who do no have \n\na choice in heir heating system and are forced o assume \n\nthe rising network charges.\n\nThe concession contracts between municipalities and gas net­\n\nwork operators se he framework for developments in he \n\nnetwork. However, municipalities have very li le influence \n\non large parts of he conten of he concession contracts. The \n\nconcession area always covers he entire municipal area by \n\nlaw and reducing it, for example due o he municipal hea \n\nplan, is no possible. Concessions are awarded exclusively \n\naccording o legally defined economic criteria, while criteria \n\nsuch as climate action have previously no been permi ed.23\n\nAccording o he EnWG, gas distribution network operators \n\nmus amortize he networks over 45 o 55 years.24 Premature \n\ndecommissioning leads o uncovered investmen costs and \n\nrequires value adjustments, leaving companies with stranded \n\n22 Agora Energiewende, Ein neuer Ordnungsrahmen für die Erdgasverteilnetze (2023) (in German; \n\navailable online).\n\n23 Julian Senders, “Wärmeplanung und Gaskonzessionen: Eine Untersuchung der bestehenden \n\nkommunalen Spielräume in der Wärmeplanung unter besonderer Berücksichtigung von Wärme­\n\nnetzen,” Würzburger Studien zum Umweltenergierecht, no. 27 (2022) (in German; available online).\n\n24 Section 46 of he EnWG.\n\nassets on heir balance sheets.25 In Germany, 55 percen of he \n\npipelines were buil or renewed between 1990 and 2020; hey \n\nwould be only partially depreciated by 2045.26 The Federal \n\nNetwork Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) has recognized he \n\nneed o adjus he expected operating life and depreciation \n\nprocedures and has begun a consultation process o do so.27 \n\nThis is an importan step in advancing he decommission­\n\ning of he natural gas distribution network.\n\nHea planning process mus be improved\n\nThe statutory obligation of hea planning creates a responsi­\n\nbility in he municipalities o coordinate he hea ransition. \n\nIn he interviews, however, various stakeholders pointed ou \n\ntha staffing levels are low in mos municipalities and ha he \n\ndevelopmen of additional capacities is no sufficiently guar­\n\nanteed due o low compensation funding for he hea plan­\n\nning.

In he interviews, civil society actors described \n\nthe process as opaque due o he lack of participation oppor­\n\ntunities. A major advantage of municipal hea planning is \n\ntha both specialists and he general public can be involved, \n\nthereby creating acceptance for he ransition a an early \n\nstage. Therefore, municipalities should be encouraged and \n\nsupported as much as possible in exploiting his advantage.\n\nConclusion: Timely decommissioning of he \n\nnetwork no ye guaranteed\n\nThe demand for natural gas for residential heating will \n\ndecline over he nex years. Natural gas distribution net­\n\nworks mus be gradually decommissioned so ha network \n\ncharges do no become oo expensive for he few remain­\n\ning customers. Municipal hea planning is a firs importan \n\nstep in accelerating he hea ransition and is, in heory, a \n\ngood instrumen for planning he decommissioning of nat­\n\nural gas distribution networks. However, he evaluation of \n\nthe firs hea plans shows ha he municipalities are ignor­\n\ning he future of gas networks, citing major uncertainties. In \n\naddition, neither municipal nor private gas network owners \n\nhave any economic interes in decommissioning, nor have \n\nthere been any regulatory incentives o do so. The EnWG \n\nprioritizes cos efficiency and he obligation o connec over \n\nclimate action. However, climate action should be placed on \n\nequal footing with hese other objectives in order o make \n\ni possible o decommission he gas distribution networks. \n\nThe consultation on he future of he natural gas distribu­\n\ntion networks launched by he German governmen in March \n\n2024 and parallel processes a he Federal Network Agency \n\nare steps in he righ direction.28\n\nMunicipal owners are facing he same limitations due o \n\nregulations and a lack of economic incentives, which make \n\ndecommissioning natural gas networks hard. The re-mu­\n\nnicipalization of gas networks ha were previously privately \n\nowned is hus no a necessary prerequisite o making he \n\nhea supply climate-friendly. Municipalities and public util­\n\nities will need suppor services in he future o adequately \n\ncompensate for he decline in he natural gas demand. Such \n\nsuppor can include, for example, he developmen of new \n\nfinancing concepts for he provision of public services. In \n\naddition, municipalities should be encouraged o develop a \n\nclear roadmap for he existing natural gas distribution net­\n\nwork infrastructure, even if his has no ye been explicitly \n\nrequired in he Hea Planning Act.\n\n28 Cf.
