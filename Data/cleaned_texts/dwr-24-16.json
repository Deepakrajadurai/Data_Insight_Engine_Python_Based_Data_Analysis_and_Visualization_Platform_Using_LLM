Policymakers should now redirect the \n\nfocus of energy policy to further expanding renewable energy \n\nsources. The year 2023 showed that the German electricity \n\nsupply remained secure following the shutdown of nuclear \n\npower plants. It is possible, affordable, and plausible in light of \n\nclimate policy to cover 80 percent of electricity consumption \n\nwith renewable energy sources, as the German Renewable \n\nEnergy Sources Act plans for by 2030. However, a swift \n\nexit from coal, and natural gas in the long run, is required to \n\nachieve this, as is suggested by scenario analyses that track \n\nthe price and volume effects as well as the grid situation on \n\nthe German electricity market for the present and for 2030. \n\nThe shutdown of nuclear power plants has been planned for a \n\nlong time and was by no means a relevant driver of electricity \n\nprices. Rather, French nuclear power plants’ erratic downtimes \n\nas well as war-related increases in gas prices drove up elec­\n\ntricity prices. The construction of new nuclear power plants, \n\nwhich has been discussed by policymakers, is irrelevant for \n\nthe energy transformation over the next decades. The natural \n\ngas crisis has also ended. In addition to the coal phase-out, the \n\nfossil fuel phase-out is an integral part of the energy transfor­\n\nmation.\n\nThe 2023 German Renewable Energy Sources Act (Erneuerbare-\n\nEnergien-Gesetz, EEG) stipulates that at least 80 percent of \n\nelectricity consumption must come from renewable energy \n\nsources by 2030.1 This implies that up to 600 terawatt hours \n\n(TWh) must be generated from renewable energy, compared \n\nto around 260 TWh today. Policymakers somewhat deprior­\n\nitized this target following the 2022 energy crisis. However, \n\nthe German and European electricity markets have since sta­\n\nbilized; electricity as well as natural gas prices are now about \n\nthe same as they were before the start of the Russo-Ukrainian \n\nWar (Figure 1). This clears the way for the next steps to be \n\ntaken, in particular accelerating the expansion of renewa­\n\nble energy sources and driving the coal phase-out, and sub­\n\nsequently the natural gas phase-out, forward. This Weekly \n\nReport updates earlier model-based scenario analyses2 and \n\ndiscusses the results from 2022 and beyond.\n\nEnergy crisis is over; security of supply was never \n\nat risk\n\nNatural gas and electricity prices were already trending \n\nupward in the run-up to the Russo-Ukrainian War and \n\nprices increased further following the start of the war on \n\nFebruary 24, 2022. However, electricity prices have fallen \n\nsharply since fall 2022 and are now around the pre-war price \n\nlevel. The same trend can be observed for natural gas prices. \n\nIn light of a decline in natural gas consumption in the long \n\nrun, the shock of the interrupted gas delivery from Russia \n\nwas quickly absorbed.3\n\n1 \n\nParagraph 1 of the Renewable Energy Sources Act (Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz, EEG) \n\n(in  German; available online; accessed on April 8, 2024.

This year was selected as the ref­\n\nerence year because the final six nuclear power plants were \n\nstill connected to the grid in 2021. Moreover, the electric­\n\nity market experienced shocks in 2022 due to the attack on \n\nUkraine. Choosing 2022 as the reference year would have \n\nsignificantly distorted the effects.\n\nIn this study, we calculated two variants, one with no nuclear \n\npower plants and one with six nuclear power plants, to make \n\n4 See, for example, Enervis Energy Advisors GmbH, Ein Jahr Atomausstieg in Deutschland – \n\nEin energiewirtschaftlicher Schulterblick (2024) (in German; available online).\n\nchanges more clearly visible. In addition, using a second sce­\n\nnario for 2030, we investigate how the electricity market could \n\ndevelop in light of the planned coal phase-out. The last six \n\nnuclear power plants in Germany that were still connected in \n\n2021 had a combined installed capacity of 8.5 gigawatts (GW) \n\ngross and 8.1 GW net,5 with total generation of 65.4 TWh in \n\n2021. Following the shutdown of the Brokdorf, Grohnde, \n\nand Gundremmingen C nuclear power plants at the end of \n\n2021, the final three plants (Emsland, Neckarwestheim 2, \n\nand Isar 2) generated 32.8 TWh (around six percent of elec­\n\ntricity production) in 2022.6\n\nThe model results for the 2021 scenario show that in a static \n\nview, a combination of existing fossil fuel power plants would \n\nhave compensated for these amounts of electricity tempo­\n\nrarily (Figure 2). This would have led to an increase in CO2 \n\nemissions in the short term. However, in reality, this effect \n\nwould have already been compensated for due to both the \n\nsimultaneous expansion of renewable energy sources as well \n\nas a decline in electricity consumption. A historical evalua­\n\ntion of the data shows that CO2 emissions even declined in \n\nboth 2022 and 2023. Between January 2021 and January 2024 \n\nalone, 29 GW of photovoltaics were constructed in addition \n\nto a further 6.7 GW of onshore wind power and 0.6 GW of \n\n5 The data comes from the Core Energy Market Data Register (Marktstammdatenregister) of the \n\nFederal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) (in German; available online).\n\n6 See AG Energiebilanzen e.V., Stromerzeugung nach Energieträgern (Strommix) von 1990 bis \n\n2023 (in TWh) Deutschland insgesamt (2024) (in German; available online).\n\nFigure 1\n\nElectricity and natural gas prices in Germany\n\nIn euros per megawatt hours\n\n \n\nSource: Authors’ depiction based on the European Energy Exchange and ENTSO-E Transparency Platform.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nAfter rising in 2022, electricity and gas prices have fallen back to the level of the \n\nprevious decade.\n\nBox 1\n\nMethodology\n\nCalculations were conducted using an updated version of the \n\nELMOD electricity market model.1 Using a two-phase mar­\n\nket simulation, the model determines a cost-minimal use of \n\ngeneration capacities at an hourly level. In line with the real \n\nmarket clearing principle, the first phase consists of comparing \n\nelectricity demand and generation supply within the individual \n\nmarket zones. Based on the merit order principle, the market \n\nclearing price is determined by the marginal costs of the most \n\nexpensive power plant that is required to meet demand cost \n\neffectively. In the second phase, the resulting power flows are \n\nsimulated based on the market result. This allows the use of \n\npower plants to be adjusted once again, which can prevent \n\nbottlenecks in the electricity grid. Such measures are also \n\nknown as redispatch measures. In order to ensure a high tem­\n\nporal resolution, generation units from neighboring countries \n\nare aggregated and combined into one node each. In addition, \n\nthe net transfer capacities between neighboring market areas \n\nare taken into account and a transmission reliability margin of \n\n20 percent of the transmission capacity is introduced instead \n\nof the calculation of (n-1) security. This makes it possible to \n\nsimulate an entire year in hourly resolution with a high level of \n\ndetail when representing the German transmission system.\n\n1 \n\nThe model was developed at TU Dresden. See Florian Leuthold, Hannes Weigt, and \n\nChristian von Hirschhausen, “ELMOD – A model of the European Electricity Market,” (work­\n\ning paper WP-EM-00, Dresden University of Technology Electricity Market, 2008) (available \n\nonline). The model has previously been used in various DIW Berlin projects (such as Claudia \n\nKemfert, Friedrich Kunz, and Juan Rosellón, “A welfare analysis of electricity transmission \n\nplanning in Germany,” Energy Policy 94 (2016): 446–452 (available online). Today it is main­\n\ntained and developed further at DIW Berlin. Current calculations are based on Enno Wiebrow \n\net al., “The Effects of Nuclear Power Plant Closures in Germany 2021–2023 on Network Flows \n\nand Redispatch – Update of Earlier ELMOD Modeling Results,” Presentation at Enerday, \n\nDresden, April 12, 2024.\n\n132\n\nDIW Weekly Report 16+17+18/2024\n\nELECTRICITY MARKET\n\noffshore wind power, which, when combined, generated an \n\nestimated 40 TWh of additional electricity in this period.7\n\nOver the years, German energy policy and infrastructure \n\nhave adapted to the nuclear phase-out, resulting in no price \n\nspikes even after the final reactors were shut down in April \n\n2023.8 The challenges of the last winters, especially the energy \n\nsupply risks that were caused by the Russo-Ukrainian War, \n\nwere overcome successfully and showed that Germany can \n\nmaintain security of supply without nuclear energy while \n\nsimultaneously driving the energy transformation forward.\n\nElectricity price effects mainly caused by erratic \n\nnuclear power plant outages in France\n\nWhile the final nuclear power plants played a small role in \n\nthe German electricity sector due to their small share in the \n\nelectricity mix, nuclear energy is the dominant power gen­\n\neration technology in France. There, nuclear power plants \n\n7 The data for the expansion of power generation facilities are from the Core Energy Market \n\nData Register. The additional generation was estimated using the full load hours for the years \n\n2021, 2022, and 2023.\n\n8 See statements from the Vice President of the Federal Network Agency, Barbie Kornelia Haller, \n\nin the Bayerischer Rundfunk: Lorenz Storch, “Ein Monat Atomausstieg: Der Strom wurde sogar \n\n billiger,” BR24 from May 15, 2023 (in German; available online).\n\ngenerated 318 TWh of electricity in 2023, which is around \n\ntwo thirds of total net electricity generation.9 Nuclear energy \n\nthus plays a much more significant role in the French elec­\n\ntricity market than in the German. More than half of France’s \n\nnuclear power plants were disconnected from the grid from \n\ntime to time in summer 2022 due to maintenance work, cor­\n\nrosion problems, and reduced river levels (Figure 3).10\n\nThis led to a significant increase in demand for imported \n\nelectricity in France. Closing this supply gap exacerbated the \n\nalready tense situation (as a result of high natural gas prices) \n\nand led to further price increases.\n\nThe electricity price in Germany over the past years shows \n\nthat generation from the last German nuclear power plants \n\nonly had a small overall impact on the price. More impactful \n\nwere the raw material prices for fossil fuels, such as hard coal \n\nand natural gas in particular, as these power plants mostly \n\ndetermine the price on the day-ahead market in the hours \n\nthat renewable energy sources cannot cover demand.11 The \n\nshutdown of the final nuclear power plants in Germany on \n\nApril 15, 2023, did not result in a higher electricity price. \n\nOn the contrary, the price even fell in the following month \n\nas, among other things, market participants anticipated the \n\nshutdown date in good time. In the hypothetical analysis for \n\n2021, the model calculations result in an average electricity \n\nprice that is 11 euros per MWh higher without the nuclear \n\npower plants in operation, which would be a price increase \n\nof about 11 percent.12 However, this change is low compared \n\nto the electricity price increase that was caused by higher raw \n\nmaterial prices, especially natural gas.\n\nIn the nuclear phase-out discussion, these amounts are basi­\n\ncally negligible compared to the total costs of nuclear energy, \n\nwhich have been paid for since the start of commercial use \n\nprimarily by transferring risk to society at large or via sub­\n\nsidies. The costs of interim and final storage of radioactive \n\nwaste have so far been completely neglected even though \n\nthese are also significant in Germany and will increase con­\n\nsiderably over time (Box 2).13\n\n9 Data based on the ENTSO-E Transparency Platform (available online).\n\n10 Cf. Mycle Schneider et al., World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2022 (available online).\n\n11 Day-ahead spot markets trade in short-term electricity products with a difference of up to one \n\nday between the conclusion of the contract and delivery or acceptance. For more information, see \n\nthe DIW Berlin Glossary (in German; available online). As the prices are determined via the mer­\n\nit order, the generation price of the final power plant that is awarded the contract is the market \n\nprice.

Model calcula­\n\ntions show that no additional substantial grid bottlenecks \n\noccurred following the shutdown of the final three nuclear \n\npower plants. Currently, Germany has a sufficiently well-de­\n\nveloped and meshed electricity grid that enables exchange \n\nwith neighboring countries and contributes to security of \n\nsupply. The efficient integration into the European inter­\n\nconnected grid makes it possible to export, and, if neces­\n\nsary, to import surplus electricity, which supports the grid \n\nstability and the reliability of energy supply to a considera­\n\nble extent. In the past years, all shutdowns of nuclear power \n\nplants in Germany have run smoothly and occurred without \n\nmajor consequence.14\n\nThe shutdown of the last six nuclear power plants in 2023 \n\nbarely changed the grid situation. The hypothetical model \n\nsimulations for 2021 show that the existing grid bottlenecks \n\nwould have remained largely unchanged and the adjust­\n\nment measures (redispatch) would only have had to be \n\n14 The unexpectedly quick shutdown of the six oldest nuclear power plants in March 2011 in re­\n\nsponse to the Fukushima disaster had only a minimal, short-term impact on the electricity prices \n\nand network stability.

Nuclear technology was \n\nand is complex, risky and thus more expensive than other \n\nenergy sources from the outset. Nuclear power plants have \n\nnot been competitive since the first commercial plants were \n\ncommissioned in the 1950s and this is still the case today.1\n\nIn addition, nuclear energy entails proliferation risks, such as \n\nmisuse for weapons development. The lack of competitiveness \n\nis exacerbated if the neglected costs of dismantling the plants \n\nand disposing of radioactive waste are taken into account. This \n\nmeans that the minor benefits of nuclear energy are offset by \n\nconsiderable long-term costs that are not foreseeable from \n\ntoday’s perspective. Debates about new reactor concepts (also \n\nknown as fourth-generation reactors) do nothing to change \n\nthis.2 New reactor concepts have been discussed for more \n\nthan 60 years, inspired by the dream of a plutonium economy, \n\nbut cannot be implemented in large quantities and with sys­\n\ntemic relevance in the foreseeable future.3\n\nNuclear energy is by no means experiencing a global renais­\n\nsance. On the contrary, the output of nuclear power plants \n\nworldwide fell by one gigawatt in 2023, while solar power \n\nplants with an output of 440 gigawatts were constructed.4 With \n\nthe exception of China, the construction of new nuclear power \n\nplants has practically come to a standstill, and even in China \n\nthe share of nuclear energy is below five percent. Only three \n\ncountries that previously did not have nuclear power plants \n\nare now building new plants or having them built, as Russia \n\nprovides both the technology and financing as a part of its \n\nnuclear diplomacy: Turkey, Bangladesh, and Egypt. There is \n\nno nuclear energy renaissance; rather, it is in decline around \n\nthe world. Thus, nuclear energy is not a relevant option for the \n\nenergy transformation in the coming decades.\n\n1 \n\nCf.

A current ex­\n\nample of the high costs of nuclear energy is the construction of the Hinkley Point C nuclear \n\npower point in the United Kingdom.

The three nuclear \n\npower plants located in the north of Germany, Brokdorf, \n\nEmsland, and Grohnde, increase the bottleneck in such a \n\nsituation.17 German grid operators have already adjusted \n\nto largely renewable electricity generation anyway. Various \n\noptions are currently being discussed for the medium-term \n\ndesign of grid management in a largely renewable electric­\n\nity system, such as nodal or zonal pricing systems.18 In addi­\n\ntion, the entire sector design must be developed for a renew­\n\nable electricity system.\n\nCoal phase-out and 80 percent renewable energy \n\nare possible by 2030\n\nTo investigate the longer-term effects on the German elec­\n\ntricity system, a scenario for 2030 is calculated in which all \n\nnuclear and coal-fired power plants have been shut down. \n\nThe basic assumption for this calculation is that the German \n\ngovernment’s expansion targets for wind power (115 GW \n\nof onshore wind power, 30 GW of offshore wind power) \n\nand photovoltaic systems (215 GW) have been achieved, the \n\ninstalled capacity of gas-fired power plants (34.7 GW) roughly \n\ncorresponds to the current level, and biomass power plants \n\n(12.8 GW) are used to cover peak loads.19 In addition, an \n\nincrease in gross electricity consumption from 525 TWh in \n\n202320 to 750 TWh in 2030 is accounted for, which is mainly \n\ncaused by the increase in electricity demand from electric \n\ncars and heat pumps.\n\nThe model calculations show that a coal phase-out is still pos­\n\nsible by 2030 (Figure 5). The wind and solar energy expansion \n\ntargets will result in around 80 percent of electricity demand \n\nbeing covered by renewable energy sources in 2030. Periods \n\nwith little solar or wind generation could be compensated \n\nfor with flexibility options, for example with flexible demand \n\n15 During a redispatch, individual power plants are shut down or started up contrary to the pre­\n\nviously agreed generation plans.

Quartal 2023 (2024) (in German; available \n\nonline).\n\n17 The costs incurred by redispatch are passed on to households through grid charges. The \n\nshutdown of nuclear power plants and the expansion of renewable energy sources led to addition­\n\nal redispatch and thus to a moderate increase in grid charges from 7.8 cents per kWh in 2021 to \n\n8.08 cents per kWh in 2022 and to 9.52 cents per kWh in 2023. However, a greater price effect can \n\nbe seen in the area of electricity procurement costs. In 2022, private households paid an average \n\nof 16.97 cents per kWh for the procurement and distribution of electricity, compared to an aver­\n\nage price paid for procurement and distribution of just 7.93 cents per kWh in 2021. The figures are \n\nbased on the BDEW electricity price analysis (In German; available online).\n\n18 Friedrich Kunz, Karsten Neuhoff, and Juan Rosellón, “FTR allocations to ease transition to \n\nnodal pricing: An application to the German power system,” Energy Economics 60 (2016): 176–185 \n\n(available online) as well as Karsten Neuhoff et al., “Renewable electric energy integration: Quanti­\n\nfying the value of design of markets for international transmission capacity,” Energy Economics 40 \n\n(2013): 760–772 (available online).\n\n19 See Bundesnetzagentur, Versorgungssicherheit Strom (2022) (in German; available online).\n\n20 See AG Energiebilanzen e.V., Stromerzeugung nach Energieträgern.\n\nFigure 4\n\nPower supply lines in the scenarios with and without nuclear \n\npower plants for 2021\n\nAccording to utilization in hours per year\n\n \n\nSource: Authors’ depiction.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nShutting down nuclear power plants only minimally changes the grid situation.\n\n135\n\nDIW Weekly Report 16+17+18/2024\n\nELECTRICITY MARKET\n\nin the area of heat pumps, electromobility, or industrial pro­\n\ncesses.21 In addition, generation from pumped-storage power \n\nplants or importing electricity are further options. In 2030, \n\nnatural gas power plants would still provide 18 percent of \n\nannual generation, but would have a strong negative trend.22\n\nDuring times with lots of generation potential from solar \n\nand wind energy, surplus electricity can be exported, while \n\nelectricity can be imported from neighboring countries when \n\nrenewable sources are generating little electricity. This leads \n\nto an overall slight net import of nine TWh.\n\nAs a part of its power plant strategy, the German Federal \n\nGovernment is planning a tender for a total of ten GW of nat­\n\nural gas power plants, which will be financed by the Climate \n\nand Transformation Fund. The subsidized natural gas power \n\nplants should be H2 ready and switch to hydrogen operation \n\n21 The additional electricity demand can be shifted by price signals to hours in which sufficient \n\nelectricity is available to avoid peak loads. Buffer tanks integrated into heat pumps make typical­\n\nly a few hours of flexibility possible. Electric cars, independent of their consumption profile and \n\nbattery size, have several hours of flexibility. In the industrial sector, electricity demand can be \n\n reduced by adjusting to high energy prices.\n\n22 These values can vary by a few percentage points depending on the weather year used as the \n\nreference year. The weather year 2019 was selected as the reference year for the 2030 scenario.\n\nbetween 2035 and 2040.23 However, according to the current \n\nstate of the technology, switching from natural gas to com­\n\nplete use of hydrogen is not an easy process.24 Therefore, \n\nthere is the danger that expanding natural gas power plants \n\ncould lead to further lock-in effects and delay the natural gas \n\nphase-out more.25 From a system transformation perspec­\n\ntive, it is therefore necessary that the power plants required \n\nfor the energy transformation are designed from the outset \n\nto run purely on hydrogen.\n\nConclusion: With the crisis over, more focus \n\nshould be on renewable energy\n\nThe German electricity market has recovered well from the \n\ncrises in 2022 and its security of supply was never at risk at \n\nany time.

Policymakers should now redirec he \n\nfocus of energy policy o further expanding renewable energy \n\nsources. The year 2023 showed ha he German electricity \n\nsupply remained secure following he shutdown of nuclear \n\npower plants. I is possible, affordable, and plausible in ligh of \n\nclimate policy o cover 80 percen of electricity consumption \n\nwith renewable energy sources, as he German Renewable \n\nEnergy Sources Ac plans for by 2030. However, a swif \n\nexi from coal, and natural gas in he long run, is required o \n\nachieve his, as is suggested by scenario analyses ha rack \n\nthe price and volume effects as well as he grid situation on \n\nthe German electricity marke for he presen and for 2030. \n\nThe shutdown of nuclear power plants has been planned for a \n\nlong ime and was by no means a relevan driver of electricity \n\nprices. Rather, French nuclear power plants’ erratic downtimes \n\nas well as war-related increases in gas prices drove up elec­\n\ntricity prices. The construction of new nuclear power plants, \n\nwhich has been discussed by policymakers, is irrelevan for \n\nthe energy ransformation over he nex decades. The natural \n\ngas crisis has also ended. In addition o he coal phase-out, he \n\nfossil fuel phase-ou is an integral par of he energy ransfor­\n\nmation.\n\nThe 2023 German Renewable Energy Sources Ac (Erneuerbare-\n\nEnergien-Gesetz, EEG) stipulates ha a leas 80 percen of \n\nelectricity consumption mus come from renewable energy \n\nsources by 2030.1 This implies ha up o 600 erawa hours \n\n(TWh) mus be generated from renewable energy, compared \n\nto around 260 TWh oday. Policymakers somewha deprior­\n\nitized his arge following he 2022 energy crisis. However, \n\nthe German and European electricity markets have since sta­\n\nbilized; electricity as well as natural gas prices are now abou \n\nthe same as hey were before he star of he Russo-Ukrainian \n\nWar (Figure 1). This clears he way for he nex steps o be \n\ntaken, in particular accelerating he expansion of renewa­\n\nble energy sources and driving he coal phase-out, and sub­\n\nsequently he natural gas phase-out, forward. This Weekly \n\nRepor updates earlier model-based scenario analyses2 and \n\ndiscusses he results from 2022 and beyond.\n\nEnergy crisis is over; security of supply was never \n\na risk\n\nNatural gas and electricity prices were already rending \n\nupward in he run-up o he Russo-Ukrainian War and \n\nprices increased further following he star of he war on \n\nFebruary 24, 2022. However, electricity prices have fallen \n\nsharply since fall 2022 and are now around he pre-war price \n\nlevel. The same rend can be observed for natural gas prices. \n\nIn ligh of a decline in natural gas consumption in he long \n\nrun, he shock of he interrupted gas delivery from Russia \n\nwas quickly absorbed.3\n\n1 \n\nParagraph 1 of he Renewable Energy Sources Ac (Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz, EEG) \n\n(in German; available online; accessed on April 8, 2024.

This year was selected as he ref­\n\nerence year because he final six nuclear power plants were \n\nstill connected o he grid in 2021. Moreover, he electric­\n\nity marke experienced shocks in 2022 due o he a ack on \n\nUkraine. Choosing 2022 as he reference year would have \n\nsignificantly distorted he effects.\n\nIn his study, we calculated wo variants, one with no nuclear \n\npower plants and one with six nuclear power plants, o make \n\n4 See, for example, Enervis Energy Advisors GmbH, Ein Jahr Atomausstieg in Deutschland – \n\nEin energiewirtschaftlicher Schulterblick (2024) (in German; available online).\n\nchanges more clearly visible. In addition, using a second sce­\n\nnario for 2030, we investigate how he electricity marke could \n\ndevelop in ligh of he planned coal phase-out. The las six \n\nnuclear power plants in Germany ha were still connected in \n\n2021 had a combined installed capacity of 8.5 gigawa s (GW) \n\ngross and 8.1 GW net,5 with otal generation of 65.4 TWh in \n\n2021. Following he shutdown of he Brokdorf, Grohnde, \n\nand Gundremmingen C nuclear power plants a he end of \n\n2021, he final hree plants (Emsland, Neckarwestheim 2, \n\nand Isar 2) generated 32.8 TWh (around six percen of elec­\n\ntricity production) in 2022.6\n\nThe model results for he 2021 scenario show ha in a static \n\nview, a combination of existing fossil fuel power plants would \n\nhave compensated for hese amounts of electricity empo­\n\nrarily (Figure 2). This would have led o an increase in CO2 \n\nemissions in he shor erm. However, in reality, his effec \n\nwould have already been compensated for due o both he \n\nsimultaneous expansion of renewable energy sources as well \n\nas a decline in electricity consumption. A historical evalua­\n\ntion of he data shows ha CO2 emissions even declined in \n\nboth 2022 and 2023. Between January 2021 and January 2024 \n\nalone, 29 GW of photovoltaics were constructed in addition \n\nto a further 6.7 GW of onshore wind power and 0.6 GW of \n\n5 The data comes from he Core Energy Marke Data Register (Marktstammdatenregister) of he \n\nFederal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) (in German; available online).\n\n6 See AG Energiebilanzen e.V., Stromerzeugung nach Energieträgern (Strommix) von 1990 bis \n\n2023 (in TWh) Deutschland insgesam (2024) (in German; available online).\n\nFigure 1\n\nElectricity and natural gas prices in Germany\n\nIn euros per megawa hours\n\n \n\nSource: Authors’ depiction based on he European Energy Exchange and ENTSO-E Transparency Platform.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nAfter rising in 2022, electricity and gas prices have fallen back o he level of he \n\nprevious decade.\n\nBox 1\n\nMethodology\n\nCalculations were conducted using an updated version of he \n\nELMOD electricity marke model.1 Using a wo-phase mar­\n\nke simulation, he model determines a cost-minimal use of \n\ngeneration capacities a an hourly level. In line with he real \n\nmarke clearing principle, he firs phase consists of comparing \n\nelectricity demand and generation supply within he individual \n\nmarke zones. Based on he meri order principle, he marke \n\nclearing price is determined by he marginal costs of he mos \n\nexpensive power plan ha is required o mee demand cos \n\neffectively. In he second phase, he resulting power flows are \n\nsimulated based on he marke result. This allows he use of \n\npower plants o be adjusted once again, which can preven \n\nbo lenecks in he electricity grid. Such measures are also \n\nknown as redispatch measures. In order o ensure a high em­\n\nporal resolution, generation units from neighboring countries \n\nare aggregated and combined into one node each. In addition, \n\nthe ne ransfer capacities between neighboring marke areas \n\nare aken into accoun and a ransmission reliability margin of \n\n20 percen of he ransmission capacity is introduced instead \n\nof he calculation of (n-1) security. This makes i possible o \n\nsimulate an entire year in hourly resolution with a high level of \n\ndetail when representing he German ransmission system.\n\n1 \n\nThe model was developed a TU Dresden.

The model has previously been used in various DIW Berlin projects (such as Claudia \n\nKemfert, Friedrich Kunz, and Juan Rosellón, “A welfare analysis of electricity ransmission \n\nplanning in Germany,” Energy Policy 94 (2016): 446–452 (available online).

More han half of France’s \n\nnuclear power plants were disconnected from he grid from \n\ntime o ime in summer 2022 due o maintenance work, cor­\n\nrosion problems, and reduced river levels (Figure 3).10\n\nThis led o a significan increase in demand for imported \n\nelectricity in France. Closing his supply gap exacerbated he \n\nalready ense situation (as a resul of high natural gas prices) \n\nand led o further price increases.\n\nThe electricity price in Germany over he pas years shows \n\ntha generation from he las German nuclear power plants \n\nonly had a small overall impac on he price. More impactful \n\nwere he raw material prices for fossil fuels, such as hard coal \n\nand natural gas in particular, as hese power plants mostly \n\ndetermine he price on he day-ahead marke in he hours \n\ntha renewable energy sources canno cover demand.11 The \n\nshutdown of he final nuclear power plants in Germany on \n\nApril 15, 2023, did no resul in a higher electricity price. \n\nOn he contrary, he price even fell in he following month \n\nas, among other hings, marke participants anticipated he \n\nshutdown date in good ime. In he hypothetical analysis for \n\n2021, he model calculations resul in an average electricity \n\nprice ha is 11 euros per MWh higher withou he nuclear \n\npower plants in operation, which would be a price increase \n\nof abou 11 percent.12 However, his change is low compared \n\nto he electricity price increase ha was caused by higher raw \n\nmaterial prices, especially natural gas.\n\nIn he nuclear phase-ou discussion, hese amounts are basi­\n\ncally negligible compared o he otal costs of nuclear energy, \n\nwhich have been paid for since he star of commercial use \n\nprimarily by ransferring risk o society a large or via sub­\n\nsidies.

Nuclear echnology was \n\nand is complex, risky and hus more expensive han other \n\nenergy sources from he outset. Nuclear power plants have \n\nno been competitive since he firs commercial plants were \n\ncommissioned in he 1950s and his is still he case oday.1\n\nIn addition, nuclear energy entails proliferation risks, such as \n\nmisuse for weapons development. The lack of competitiveness \n\nis exacerbated if he neglected costs of dismantling he plants \n\nand disposing of radioactive waste are aken into account. This \n\nmeans ha he minor benefits of nuclear energy are offse by \n\nconsiderable long-term costs ha are no foreseeable from \n\ntoday’s perspective. Debates abou new reactor concepts (also \n\nknown as fourth-generation reactors) do nothing o change \n\nthis.2 New reactor concepts have been discussed for more \n\nthan 60 years, inspired by he dream of a plutonium economy, \n\nbu canno be implemented in large quantities and with sys­\n\ntemic relevance in he foreseeable future.3\n\nNuclear energy is by no means experiencing a global renais­\n\nsance. On he contrary, he outpu of nuclear power plants \n\nworldwide fell by one gigawa in 2023, while solar power \n\nplants with an outpu of 440 gigawa s were constructed.4 With \n\nthe exception of China, he construction of new nuclear power \n\nplants has practically come o a standstill, and even in China \n\nthe share of nuclear energy is below five percent. Only hree \n\ncountries ha previously did no have nuclear power plants \n\nare now building new plants or having hem built, as Russia \n\nprovides both he echnology and financing as a par of its \n\nnuclear diplomacy: Turkey, Bangladesh, and Egypt. There is \n\nno nuclear energy renaissance; rather, i is in decline around \n\nthe world. Thus, nuclear energy is no a relevan option for he \n\nenergy ransformation in he coming decades.\n\n1 \n\nCf.

The hree nuclear \n\npower plants located in he north of Germany, Brokdorf, \n\nEmsland, and Grohnde, increase he bo leneck in such a \n\nsituation.17 German grid operators have already adjusted \n\nto largely renewable electricity generation anyway. Various \n\noptions are currently being discussed for he medium-term \n\ndesign of grid managemen in a largely renewable electric­\n\nity system, such as nodal or zonal pricing systems.18 In addi­\n\ntion, he entire sector design mus be developed for a renew­\n\nable electricity system.\n\nCoal phase-ou and 80 percen renewable energy \n\nare possible by 2030\n\nTo investigate he longer-term effects on he German elec­\n\ntricity system, a scenario for 2030 is calculated in which all \n\nnuclear and coal-fired power plants have been shu down. \n\nThe basic assumption for his calculation is ha he German \n\ngovernment’s expansion argets for wind power (115 GW \n\nof onshore wind power, 30 GW of offshore wind power) \n\nand photovoltaic systems (215 GW) have been achieved, he \n\ninstalled capacity of gas-fired power plants (34.7 GW) roughly \n\ncorresponds o he curren level, and biomass power plants \n\n(12.8 GW) are used o cover peak loads.19 In addition, an \n\nincrease in gross electricity consumption from 525 TWh in \n\n202320 o 750 TWh in 2030 is accounted for, which is mainly \n\ncaused by he increase in electricity demand from electric \n\ncars and hea pumps.\n\nThe model calculations show ha a coal phase-ou is still pos­\n\nsible by 2030 (Figure 5). The wind and solar energy expansion \n\ntargets will resul in around 80 percen of electricity demand \n\nbeing covered by renewable energy sources in 2030. Periods \n\nwith li le solar or wind generation could be compensated \n\nfor with flexibility options, for example with flexible demand \n\n15 During a redispatch, individual power plants are shu down or started up contrary o he pre­\n\nviously agreed generation plans.

In 2030, \n\nnatural gas power plants would still provide 18 percen of \n\nannual generation, bu would have a strong negative rend.22\n\nDuring imes with lots of generation potential from solar \n\nand wind energy, surplus electricity can be exported, while \n\nelectricity can be imported from neighboring countries when \n\nrenewable sources are generating li le electricity. This leads \n\nto an overall sligh ne impor of nine TWh.\n\nAs a par of its power plan strategy, he German Federal \n\nGovernmen is planning a ender for a otal of en GW of nat­\n\nural gas power plants, which will be financed by he Climate \n\nand Transformation Fund. The subsidized natural gas power \n\nplants should be H2 ready and switch o hydrogen operation \n\n21 The additional electricity demand can be shifted by price signals o hours in which sufficien \n\nelectricity is available o avoid peak loads. Buffer anks integrated into hea pumps make ypical­\n\nly a few hours of flexibility possible. Electric cars, independen of heir consumption profile and \n\nba ery size, have several hours of flexibility. In he industrial sector, electricity demand can be \n\n reduced by adjusting o high energy prices.\n\n22 These values can vary by a few percentage points depending on he weather year used as he \n\nreference year. The weather year 2019 was selected as he reference year for he 2030 scenario.\n\nbetween 2035 and 2040.23 However, according o he curren \n\nstate of he echnology, switching from natural gas o com­\n\nplete use of hydrogen is no an easy process.24 Therefore, \n\nthere is he danger ha expanding natural gas power plants \n\ncould lead o further lock-in effects and delay he natural gas \n\nphase-ou more.25 From a system ransformation perspec­\n\ntive, i is herefore necessary ha he power plants required \n\nfor he energy ransformation are designed from he outse \n\nto run purely on hydrogen.\n\nConclusion: With he crisis over, more focus \n\nshould be on renewable energy\n\nThe German electricity marke has recovered well from he \n\ncrises in 2022 and its security of supply was never a risk a \n\nany ime.
