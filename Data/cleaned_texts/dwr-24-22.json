When \n\nassessing proposed mergers, Competition Authorities should \n\nconsider its impact on all relevant markets. Large mergers \n\nbetween manufacturers typically impact competition, thus \n\nrequiring the approval of Competition Authorities. Divestitures \n\nare often a condition of merger approval. This report investi­\n\ngates the effectiveness of implementing such merger reme­\n\ndies when bargaining between manufacturers and retailers \n\nis a key market feature. We examine the upstream merger \n\nbetween DEMB and Mondeléz that was approved by the Euro­\n\npean Commission in May 2015, subject to a divestiture. The \n\ndivestiture indeed helped to mitigate the negative impacts of \n\nthe merger. From the consumer’s point of view, divestitures \n\nshould take place in favor of manufacturers with less bargain­\n\ning power.\n\nIn concentrated markets, merger control is an important \n\ntool for Competition Authorities. This is because it can \n\nprevent further reductions in competition and because it \n\nis allowed to actively intervene in the market.\n\nThis also applies to the food sector, where concentration \n\nalong the supply chain has increased significantly in recent \n\nyears. Retail has seen significant concentration, driven by \n\nwaves of mergers,1 the formation of buying alliances,2 and \n\nthe proliferation of private labels.3 Similarly, there has been \n\nan increase in concentration within the manufacturing sec­\n\ntor.4 This concentration is driven in part by mergers and \n\nacquisitions that have allowed manufacturers to increase \n\ntheir market power. As a result, most markets along the \n\nfood supply chain tend to be characterized by an oligopolis­\n\ntic market structure, in which a few firms with large market \n\nshares operate at each level of the supply chain.\n\nChanges in competition and, therefore, market power at \n\none level of the supply chain are likely to affect all levels. For \n\ninstance, in the case of an upstream merger, a reduction in \n\nthe number of food manufacturers may lead to an increase \n\nin their market power, which could result in higher whole­\n\nsale prices paid by the retailers. The extent to which this \n\nincreased upstream market power is passed on to final con­\n\nsumers depends on the bargaining power of the downstream \n\nfirms. Therefore, in vertically related markets, Competition \n\nAuthorities must analyze the entire vertical market struc­\n\nture in order to accurately assess the degree of competition \n\nalong the value chain and the likely impact that changes in \n\ncompetition may have on food-consumer prices. This is the \n\ncase, for example, in the event of a merger and the imple­\n\nmentation of remedies to address competition concerns.\n\n1 \n\nBhattacharya Vivek, et al., “Merger effects and antitrust enforcement: Evidence from us retail,” \n\nNBER Working Paper 31123 (2023): 1–75 (available online).\n\n2 Matthew Grennan, “Price discrimination and bargaining: Empirical evidence from medical \n\n devices,” American Economic Review 103, no. 1 (2013): 145–177 (available online).\n\n3 Claire Chambolle and Morgane Guignard, “Buyer Power and the Effect of Vertical Integration \n\non Innovation,” DIW Berlin Discussion Paper no. 2071 (2024): 1–36 (available online).\n\n4 Jan De Loecker, et al., “The rise of market power and the macroeconomic implications,” The \n\nQuarterly Journal of Economics 135, no. 2 (2020): 561–644 (available online).\n\n161\n\nDIW Weekly Report 22+23/2024\n\nMERGER CONTROL AND BARGAINING POWER\n\nFigure\n\nBrand portfolio of the merger and the buyer before and after the merger with divestiture\n\n \n\n Source: Authors’ depiction.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nCarte Noire was divested and is now a part of Lavazza.\n\nBox 1\n\nDEMB/Mondeléz joint venture\n\nIn May 2014, US company Mondeléz International Inc. (“Mondelez”) \n\nand Dutch company DE Master Blenders 1753 (“DEMB”) agreed \n\nto form a new entity called Jacobs Douwe Egberts (“JDE”).1 The \n\njoint venture was expected to be the number one or number two \n\nplayer in approximately 18 countries in Europe, Latin America, \n\nand Australia.2 In Germany, DEMB produces leading brands such \n\nas Senseo, and Mondeléz owns brands such as Jacobs. This is \n\nalso the case in France, where both companies own well-known \n\nbrands such as Grand’Mère for Mondeléz and L’Or for DEMB. The \n\nEuropean Commission considered the relevant geographic mar­\n\nkets as national and evaluated that the merger impacts Austria, \n\nBulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, \n\nHungary, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, \n\nSpain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. However, the merger \n\nwas only cleared subject to divestitures in some countries where \n\n1 \n\nCf. the website of the European Commission merger case M. 7292 (available online).\n\n2 Cf. the website of JDE (available online). A joint venture is an entity formed by several com­\n\npanies pooling skills and capital for a specific project. In this report, we use the terms merger and \n\njoint venture interchangeably.\n\ncompetition issues were expected at the national level such as \n\nFrance and Denmark. For Germany, the European Commission \n\nexpressed some concerns about the filter pads market. However, \n\nfollowing assessment, the European Commission concluded that \n\nthe transaction was not expected to create a significant obstacle to \n\neffective competition. In France, however, the Commission found \n\nthat the merger would raise anti-competitive concern by eliminat­\n\ning competition between the brands L’Or and Carte Noire, which \n\nare viewed by consumers as close substitutes both owned by the \n\nparties, thus requiring a divestiture. The merged entity proposed \n\nto divest Carte Noire to Lavazza, including a production plant lo­\n\ncated in the south of France. Lavazza centralized all its production \n\nlines at the facility. The acquisition enhanced Lavazza’s entry into \n\nthe French market through the acquisition of a local production \n\nplant. The Commission approved the divestiture in February 2016. \n\nThe figure shows the brand portfolio of the merging parties and of \n\nLavazza before and after the merger and the divestiture (Figure).\n\n162\n\nDIW Weekly Report 22+23/2024\n\nMERGER CONTROL AND BARGAINING POWER\n\nThis report analyses the impact of a landmark European \n\nmerger case between DEMB and Mondelēz on prices and \n\nconsumer welfare in the coffee market (Box 1). Particular \n\nemphasis is placed on assessing the effectiveness of the \n\nimposed divestiture as a remedy to eliminate the anti-com­\n\npetitive effects of the merger, when taking into account bar­\n\ngaining power along the supply chain.5\n\nFew Retailers and Coffee Manufacturers \n\ndominate the European Coffee Market\n\nIn Europe, a few retailers and coffee manufacturers have sig­\n\nnificant market share in the consumer packaged goods mar­\n\nket. For instance, in Germany, major players – Aldi, Edeka, \n\nREWE, and the Schwarz-Group – dominate the retail market; \n\nin France, E.Leclerc, Carrefour, Les Mousquetaires (ITM), \n\nand Système U dominate. For example, in 2021, the com­\n\nbined market share of the top four companies in the retail \n\nindustry was 54.6 percent in Germany and 68.7 percent in \n\nFrance, indicating significant market dominance by a few \n\nlarge players.6 Moreover, in France, the combined market \n\nshare of the three largest coffee manufacturers was approx­\n\nimately 58 percent in 2013.7\n\n5 See Yann Delaprez und Morgane Guignard, “Upstream Mergers with Divestitures in Vertical \n\nMarkets” (2022) (available online).\n\n6 See Erin Maddren, The grocery retail market in Germany (Europe Market Research: 2022), 8 \n\n(available online); for France, see the Statista website (available online). CR4 corresponds to the \n\nhighest four-firm concentration ratios often referred to as CR4. A value above 50 percent suggests \n\nsignificant market control by these firms, indicating high concentration and potentially reduced \n\ncompetition.\n\n7 Authors’ calculation based on Kantar Worldpanel data.\n\nIn such concentrated markets, wholesale prices are usually \n\nset through negotiations between manufacturers and retail­\n\ners. A suitable economic model for investigating these nego­\n\ntiations and the effects of mergers on the manufacturers is \n\nthe Nash bargaining model (Box 2).8 Bargaining power plays \n\na decisive role in the model: the greater a manufacturer's bar­\n\ngaining power vis-à-vis a retailer, the higher the wholesale \n\nprices it can impose and the higher consumer prices will be. \n\nConversely, if the bargaining power lies with the retailer, the \n\nwholesale and consumer prices will be relatively low.\n\nFrench retailers have a lot of bargaining power\n\nThe first step of our analysis is to estimate the bargain­\n\ning power of the manufacturers and retailers along the \n\ncoffee value chain. Specifically, we examine purchases \n\nfrom the seven leading retailers: Carrefour, Leclerc, ITM, \n\nAuchan, Système U, Casino, and an aggregate of discount­\n\ners. Additionally, our focus extends to the brands produced \n\nby the eight largest manufacturers: DEMB, Lavazza, Legal, \n\nMalongo, Mondelez, Nestlé, Segafredo, and an aggregate of \n\nprivate labels. This approach encompasses all manufactur­\n\ners mentioned by the Competition Authority and cited in \n\nthe merger case. The data used for the analysis is Kantar \n\nWorldpanel on consumer coffee purchases in France from \n\n2013 to 2017. It aims to implement a retrospective analysis \n\nof the DEMB/Mondelēz merger case.\n\nThe results indicate that manufacturers face powerful retail­\n\ners in the French coffee market (Figure 1). The merged entity \n\nhas the weakest bargaining power vis-à-vis retailers compared \n\nto other manufacturers. The buyer of the divested brand also \n\n8 Henrick Horn and Asher Wolinsky, “Bilateral monopolies and incentives for merger,” The \n\nRAND Journal of Economics 19, no. 3 (1988): 408–419 (available online).\n\nBox 2\n\nNash barganing model\n\nThe model assumes that bilateral contracts between manu­\n\nfacturers and retailers lead to gains from trade. These gains \n\nfrom trade are defined as the difference between the benefits \n\nof reaching an agreement and those that would have been \n\nobtained if the agreement failed. When an agreement fails, a \n\ngiven manufacturer can sell its other products. The larger its \n\nportfolio of products, the less the manufacturer gains from an \n\nagreement with a given retailer. Thus, a larger product port­\n\nfolio leads to a better bargaining position vis-à-vis retailers. \n\nGains from trade are split between the manufacturers and \n\nretailers. A manufacturer obtaining a higher share of the gains \n\ncreated from trade is said to have more bargaining power, \n\nwhich is represented by the so-called bargaining weights. \n\nHere we estimate the bargaining weight of each side in simu­\n\nlations, where this bargaining power is estimated, with values \n\nranging from zero (no bargaining power) to one (full bargaining \n\npower).\n\nFigure 1\n\nUnequal barganing power along the coffee supply chain\n\nBargaining weight of manufacturers vis-à-vis retailers\n\n \n\nNote: Bargaining weight parameters should lie in the interval [0,1].\n\nSource: Authors’ calculations.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nManufacturers have less bargaining.\n\n163\n\nDIW Weekly Report 22+23/2024\n\nMERGER CONTROL AND BARGAINING POWER\n\nhas weak bargaining power vis-à-vis retailers.9 It implies that \n\nthe negative effect—the increase in wholesale pricing—gen­\n\nerated by the merger between manufacturers in the upstream \n\nmarket is not fully passed on to final consumers.\n\nOur estimates also allow for quantifying the cost savings \n\nassociated with the merger and divestiture. The results sug­\n\ngest that the total costs associated with the other products \n\nof the buyer of the divested brand, Lavazza, decreased after \n\nthe divestiture. Indeed, the divestiture included Mondelez's \n\nmanufacturing facility situated in the south of France, where \n\nLavazza combined all its production lines for the Carte Noire \n\nbrand. The acquisition of the French manufacturing facil­\n\nity enabled Lavazza to produce its own brand at the French \n\nfacility, providing it easier access to the French market and \n\nachieving more efficient production.\n\nWithout Divestiture, the Merger would have led \n\nto higher Consumer Prices\n\nTo measure the impact of the merger and divestiture on final \n\nprices, it is necessary to determine what prices would have \n\nbeen in the absence of the merger and divestiture. However, \n\nour dataset only allows us to observe actual prices after the \n\nmerger and divestiture occurred. The model can be used to \n\nsimulate counterfactual prices to evaluate the changes in \n\nprices resulting from the merger and the divestiture, while \n\nconsidering the bargaining power within the vertical rela­\n\ntionships existing in the French coffee market. This involves \n\nsimulating two scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: The merger does not occur.\n\nScenario 2: The merger occurs without divestiture.\n\nThe comparison between the simulated prices of Scenario 1 \n\nand the observed prices measures the price effect of the \n\nmerger and the divestiture. The comparison between the \n\nsimulated prices of Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 measures the \n\nprice effect of the merger without divestiture. Furthermore, \n\nthe model enables us to estimate changes in consumer sur­\n\nplus in response to counterfactual prices.\n\nFigure 2 shows the percentage changes in prices resulting \n\nfrom the merger with and without the divestiture. The results \n\nindicate that, in the absence of divestiture, the merger would \n\nhave led to price increases of around 5 percent, which corre­\n\nsponds to an increase of around 1.14 euros per kilogram. The \n\nprice changes resulting from the merger with the divestiture \n\nimposed by the European Commission are lower, resulting \n\ninstead in a price increase of approximately two percent, or \n\nan increase of approximately 0.46 euros per kilogram. In addi­\n\ntion, the divestiture resulted in some cost efficiencies for the \n\nbuyer, which led to a price decrease of approximately 1.72 per­\n\ncent, or approximately 0.22 euros per kilogram (Figure 2).\n\n9 Due to confidentiality restrictions, specific manufacturer names cannot be directly associated \n\nwith prices or market shares.\n\nColumns (i) and (ii) of the Table show the variation in con­\n\nsumer surplus with and without the divestiture.10 Had the \n\nEuropean Commission approved the merger without rem­\n\nedies, the reduction in consumer surplus would have been \n\nmore pronounced than with remedies, decreasing consumer \n\nsurplus by about 483,000 euros for sampled consumers. \n\nThe merger cleared with divestiture led to an overall reduc­\n\ntion in consumer surplus of about 132,000 euros for sam­\n\npled consumers.\n\nThe results indicate that although the merger reduced con­\n\nsumer surplus, this reduction is mitigated by the divesti­\n\nture. This supports the European Commission's decision \n\nto require divestiture to mitigate the anticompetitive effects \n\nof the merger. Yet, the divestiture failed both to fully pre­\n\nvent negative consumer effects and to restore competition.\n\nConsidering Bargaining Power in Vertically \n\nrelated Markets is important when requiring \n\ndivestiture\n\nWe now examine the importance of quantifying bargaining \n\npower when evaluating potential buyers of divested brands \n\nin order to effectively assess the impact of divestiture on con­\n\nsumer prices. We provide recommendations to Competition \n\nAuthorities on how to select the buyer of the divested brand \n\nin vertical markets.\n\n10 Discrete choice models are used to calculate the change in consumer surplus; Kenneth Train, \n\n“Discrete Choice Methods with Simulation,” Second Edition.

Mergers must be approved by Competition Authorities. \n\nA condition of merger approval is often the implementation \n\nof a divestiture.\n\nIn this report, we discuss the effectiveness of divestiture as \n\na merger remedy. We argue that it may be less effective in \n\nvertically related industries where bargaining is a key feature \n\nof the market. If Competition Authorities ignore the inher­\n\nent imbalance in bargaining power between manufacturers \n\nand retailers when enforcing upstream divestiture, they are \n\nlikely to implement a policy that does not restore competi­\n\ntion in the market.\n\nThe main reason is that there is not a direct relationship \n\nbetween market share and bargaining power. The bargain­\n\ning literature identifies several potential determinants of \n\nbargaining power. For example, higher bargaining power \n\nmay result from superior brand assortment, firms' willing­\n\nness to bargain patiently, or enhanced bargaining skills. \n\nAntitrust authorities cannot infer these bargaining power \n\nvalues from observed market shares alone, as we show that a \n\nsmall buyer can have large bargaining power and reduce con­\n\nsumer surplus more than a large buyer with smaller bargain­\n\ning power. Therefore, an accurate estimation of these bar­\n\ngaining weights is crucial for decisions regarding the selec­\n\ntion of the buyer for the divested brand. This has important \n\nimplications for competition policy in Europe, but also spe­\n\ncifically in Germany.\n\nGermany recently introduced a new amendment to \n\nthe German Competition Act, known as the 11th GWB \n\nAmendment, that could increase the number of divesti­\n\ntures in certain markets. Indeed, an important aspect of \n\nthis amendment is the introduction of a new market inves­\n\ntigation tool that allows for policy intervention in markets \n\nwhere there are significant and lasting distortion of com­\n\npetition without a proven breach of competition law.11 This \n\nreport argues that bargaining power is a key factor that must \n\nbe taken into consideration.\n\n11 For more details, see Tabea Bauermeister, “New Provisions in German Competition Law: New \n\nCompetition Tool, Provisions Accompanying the DMA and a Presumption of Benefits,” Kluwer \n\n Competition Law Blog, 2023. (available online).\n\nPrecisely, we study an alternative scenario in which the \n\ndivested brand is transferred to a different manufacturer. \n\nThis hypothetical scenario is interesting because the alterna­\n\ntive manufacturer has a smaller market share (1.57 percent \n\non average compared to 1.83 percent for the actual buyer) \n\nbut higher bargaining power than the actual buyer (0.41 \n\nfor the rival manufacturer compared to 0.27 for the actual \n\nbuyer). Because of the smaller market share it would be a \n\nmore acceptable alternative for approval by the Competition \n\nAuthorities, compared to the actual buyer, when ignoring \n\nthe bargaining power.\n\nBy contrast, we find that divesting to a small buyer – in terms \n\nof market shares – might not be the best policy in vertically \n\nrelated industries. Indeed, our results suggest that divesting \n\na brand to a small buyer with significant bargaining power is \n\nunlikely to mitigate the anti-competitive effects of the merger. \n\nIf the divested brand is bought by the alternative buyer (col­\n\numn (iii)), the negative impact on consumer surplus becomes \n\nmore pronounced with an overall decrease in consumer sur­\n\nplus of about 149,000 euros for sampled consumers.\n\nMore broadly, the results indicate that the actual divestiture \n\nleads to the smallest change in consumer surplus.\n\nConclusion: Bargaining Power must be \n\nunderstood when evaluating mergers\n\nThe food supply chain is a key driver of the European econ­\n\nomy. The degree of competition at each level of the supply \n\nchain determines the extent to which a change in compe­\n\ntition at one level of the supply chain will affect all levels.\n\nTable\n\nThe choice of the buyer in vertically related market\n\nChange in consumer surplus in euros\n\nSimulations\n\n(i)\n\nActual buyer\n\n(ii)\n\nNo divestiture\n\n(iii)\n\nAlternative buyer \n\n(rival)\n\nTotal change in consumer surplus (euros)\n\n−132,000\n\n−483,000\n\n−149,000\n\nManufacturer’s bargaining weight\n\n0.27\n\n0.41\n\nPre-merger market shares (percent)\n\n1.83\n\n1.57\n\nNote: The average total number of consumers in our sample is 9,300 per month.\n\nSource: Authors’ calculations.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nJEL: D12, L11, L51, L40\n\nKeywords: Bargaining Power, Merger, Competition Authority, Consumer Surplus\n\nYann Delaprez is post-doctoral researcher at the University of LUISS and \n\nFellow at the Berlin Centre for Consumer Policies (BCCP) at DIW Berlin | \n\nydelaprez@luiss.it\n\nMorgane Guignard is research associate in the Department of Firms and \n\nMarkets at DIW Berlin | mguignard@diw.de",

From he consumer’s poin of view, divestitures \n\nshould ake place in favor of manufacturers with less bargain­\n\ning power.\n\nIn concentrated markets, merger control is an importan \n\ntool for Competition Authorities. This is because i can \n\npreven further reductions in competition and because i \n\nis allowed o actively intervene in he market.\n\nThis also applies o he food sector, where concentration \n\nalong he supply chain has increased significantly in recen \n\nyears. Retail has seen significan concentration, driven by \n\nwaves of mergers,1 he formation of buying alliances,2 and \n\nthe proliferation of private labels.3 Similarly, here has been \n\nan increase in concentration within he manufacturing sec­\n\ntor.4 This concentration is driven in par by mergers and \n\nacquisitions ha have allowed manufacturers o increase \n\ntheir marke power. As a result, mos markets along he \n\nfood supply chain end o be characterized by an oligopolis­\n\ntic marke structure, in which a few firms with large marke \n\nshares operate a each level of he supply chain.\n\nChanges in competition and, herefore, marke power a \n\none level of he supply chain are likely o affec all levels. For \n\ninstance, in he case of an upstream merger, a reduction in \n\nthe number of food manufacturers may lead o an increase \n\nin heir marke power, which could resul in higher whole­\n\nsale prices paid by he retailers. The exten o which his \n\nincreased upstream marke power is passed on o final con­\n\nsumers depends on he bargaining power of he downstream \n\nfirms. Therefore, in vertically related markets, Competition \n\nAuthorities mus analyze he entire vertical marke struc­\n\nture in order o accurately assess he degree of competition \n\nalong he value chain and he likely impac ha changes in \n\ncompetition may have on food-consumer prices. This is he \n\ncase, for example, in he even of a merger and he imple­\n\nmentation of remedies o address competition concerns.\n\n1 \n\nBha acharya Vivek, e al., “Merger effects and antitrus enforcement: Evidence from us retail,” \n\nNBER Working Paper 31123 (2023): 1–75 (available online).\n\n2 Ma hew Grennan, “Price discrimination and bargaining: Empirical evidence from medical \n\n devices,” American Economic Review 103, no. 1 (2013): 145–177 (available online).\n\n3 Claire Chambolle and Morgane Guignard, “Buyer Power and he Effec of Vertical Integration \n\non Innovation,” DIW Berlin Discussion Paper no. 2071 (2024): 1–36 (available online).\n\n4 Jan De Loecker, e al., “The rise of marke power and he macroeconomic implications,” The \n\nQuarterly Journal of Economics 135, no. 2 (2020): 561–644 (available online).\n\n161\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 22+23/2024\n\nMERGER CONTROL AND BARGAINING POWER\n\nFigure\n\nBrand portfolio of he merger and he buyer before and after he merger with divestiture\n\n \n\n Source: Authors’ depiction.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nCarte Noire was divested and is now a par of Lavazza.\n\nBox 1\n\nDEMB/Mondeléz join venture\n\nIn May 2014, US company Mondeléz International Inc. (“Mondelez”) \n\nand Dutch company DE Master Blenders 1753 (“DEMB”) agreed \n\nto form a new entity called Jacobs Douwe Egberts (“JDE”).1 The \n\njoin venture was expected o be he number one or number wo \n\nplayer in approximately 18 countries in Europe, Latin America, \n\nand Australia.2 In Germany, DEMB produces leading brands such \n\nas Senseo, and Mondeléz owns brands such as Jacobs. This is \n\nalso he case in France, where both companies own well-known \n\nbrands such as Grand’Mère for Mondeléz and L’Or for DEMB. The \n\nEuropean Commission considered he relevan geographic mar­\n\nkets as national and evaluated ha he merger impacts Austria, \n\nBulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, \n\nHungary, Latvia, Lithuania, he Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, \n\nSpain, Sweden, and he United Kingdom. However, he merger \n\nwas only cleared subjec o divestitures in some countries where \n\n1 \n\nCf. he website of he European Commission merger case M. 7292 (available online).\n\n2 Cf. he website of JDE (available online).

In his report, we use he erms merger and \n\njoin venture interchangeably.\n\ncompetition issues were expected a he national level such as \n\nFrance and Denmark. For Germany, he European Commission \n\nexpressed some concerns abou he filter pads market. However, \n\nfollowing assessment, he European Commission concluded ha \n\nthe ransaction was no expected o create a significan obstacle o \n\neffective competition. In France, however, he Commission found \n\ntha he merger would raise anti-competitive concern by eliminat­\n\ning competition between he brands L’Or and Carte Noire, which \n\nare viewed by consumers as close substitutes both owned by he \n\nparties, hus requiring a divestiture. The merged entity proposed \n\nto dives Carte Noire o Lavazza, including a production plan lo­\n\ncated in he south of France. Lavazza centralized all its production \n\nlines a he facility. The acquisition enhanced Lavazza’s entry into \n\nthe French marke hrough he acquisition of a local production \n\nplant. The Commission approved he divestiture in February 2016. \n\nThe figure shows he brand portfolio of he merging parties and of \n\nLavazza before and after he merger and he divestiture (Figure).\n\n162\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 22+23/2024\n\nMERGER CONTROL AND BARGAINING POWER\n\nThis repor analyses he impac of a landmark European \n\nmerger case between DEMB and Mondelēz on prices and \n\nconsumer welfare in he coffee marke (Box 1). Particular \n\nemphasis is placed on assessing he effectiveness of he \n\nimposed divestiture as a remedy o eliminate he anti-com­\n\npetitive effects of he merger, when aking into accoun bar­\n\ngaining power along he supply chain.5\n\nFew Retailers and Coffee Manufacturers \n\ndominate he European Coffee Market\n\nIn Europe, a few retailers and coffee manufacturers have sig­\n\nnifican marke share in he consumer packaged goods mar­\n\nket. For instance, in Germany, major players – Aldi, Edeka, \n\nREWE, and he Schwarz-Group – dominate he retail market; \n\nin France, E.Leclerc, Carrefour, Les Mousquetaires (ITM), \n\nand Système U dominate. For example, in 2021, he com­\n\nbined marke share of he op four companies in he retail \n\nindustry was 54.6 percen in Germany and 68.7 percen in \n\nFrance, indicating significan marke dominance by a few \n\nlarge players.6 Moreover, in France, he combined marke \n\nshare of he hree larges coffee manufacturers was approx­\n\nimately 58 percen in 2013.7\n\n5 See Yann Delaprez und Morgane Guignard, “Upstream Mergers with Divestitures in Vertical \n\nMarkets” (2022) (available online).\n\n6 See Erin Maddren, The grocery retail marke in Germany (Europe Marke Research: 2022), 8 \n\n(available online); for France, see he Statista website (available online). CR4 corresponds o he \n\nhighes four-firm concentration ratios often referred o as CR4. A value above 50 percen suggests \n\nsignifican marke control by hese firms, indicating high concentration and potentially reduced \n\ncompetition.\n\n7 Authors’ calculation based on Kantar Worldpanel data.\n\nIn such concentrated markets, wholesale prices are usually \n\nse hrough negotiations between manufacturers and retail­\n\ners. A suitable economic model for investigating hese nego­\n\ntiations and he effects of mergers on he manufacturers is \n\nthe Nash bargaining model (Box 2).8 Bargaining power plays \n\na decisive role in he model: he greater a manufacturer's bar­\n\ngaining power vis-à-vis a retailer, he higher he wholesale \n\nprices i can impose and he higher consumer prices will be. \n\nConversely, if he bargaining power lies with he retailer, he \n\nwholesale and consumer prices will be relatively low.\n\nFrench retailers have a lo of bargaining power\n\nThe firs step of our analysis is o estimate he bargain­\n\ning power of he manufacturers and retailers along he \n\ncoffee value chain. Specifically, we examine purchases \n\nfrom he seven leading retailers: Carrefour, Leclerc, ITM, \n\nAuchan, Système U, Casino, and an aggregate of discount­\n\ners. Additionally, our focus extends o he brands produced \n\nby he eigh larges manufacturers: DEMB, Lavazza, Legal, \n\nMalongo, Mondelez, Nestlé, Segafredo, and an aggregate of \n\nprivate labels. This approach encompasses all manufactur­\n\ners mentioned by he Competition Authority and cited in \n\nthe merger case. The data used for he analysis is Kantar \n\nWorldpanel on consumer coffee purchases in France from \n\n2013 o 2017. I aims o implemen a retrospective analysis \n\nof he DEMB/Mondelēz merger case.\n\nThe results indicate ha manufacturers face powerful retail­\n\ners in he French coffee marke (Figure 1).

These gains \n\nfrom rade are defined as he difference between he benefits \n\nof reaching an agreemen and hose ha would have been \n\nobtained if he agreemen failed. When an agreemen fails, a \n\ngiven manufacturer can sell its other products. The larger its \n\nportfolio of products, he less he manufacturer gains from an \n\nagreemen with a given retailer. Thus, a larger produc port­\n\nfolio leads o a be er bargaining position vis-à-vis retailers. \n\nGains from rade are spli between he manufacturers and \n\nretailers. A manufacturer obtaining a higher share of he gains \n\ncreated from rade is said o have more bargaining power, \n\nwhich is represented by he so-called bargaining weights. \n\nHere we estimate he bargaining weigh of each side in simu­\n\nlations, where his bargaining power is estimated, with values \n\nranging from zero (no bargaining power) o one (full bargaining \n\npower).\n\nFigure 1\n\nUnequal barganing power along he coffee supply chain\n\nBargaining weigh of manufacturers vis-à-vis retailers\n\n \n\nNote: Bargaining weigh parameters should lie in he interval [0,1].\n\nSource: Authors’ calculations.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nManufacturers have less bargaining.\n\n163\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 22+23/2024\n\nMERGER CONTROL AND BARGAINING POWER\n\nhas weak bargaining power vis-à-vis retailers.9 I implies ha \n\nthe negative effect—the increase in wholesale pricing—gen­\n\nerated by he merger between manufacturers in he upstream \n\nmarke is no fully passed on o final consumers.\n\nOur estimates also allow for quantifying he cos savings \n\nassociated with he merger and divestiture. The results sug­\n\nges ha he otal costs associated with he other products \n\nof he buyer of he divested brand, Lavazza, decreased after \n\nthe divestiture. Indeed, he divestiture included Mondelez's \n\nmanufacturing facility situated in he south of France, where \n\nLavazza combined all its production lines for he Carte Noire \n\nbrand. The acquisition of he French manufacturing facil­\n\nity enabled Lavazza o produce its own brand a he French \n\nfacility, providing i easier access o he French marke and \n\nachieving more efficien production.\n\nWithou Divestiture, he Merger would have led \n\nto higher Consumer Prices\n\nTo measure he impac of he merger and divestiture on final \n\nprices, i is necessary o determine wha prices would have \n\nbeen in he absence of he merger and divestiture. However, \n\nour datase only allows us o observe actual prices after he \n\nmerger and divestiture occurred. The model can be used o \n\nsimulate counterfactual prices o evaluate he changes in \n\nprices resulting from he merger and he divestiture, while \n\nconsidering he bargaining power within he vertical rela­\n\ntionships existing in he French coffee market. This involves \n\nsimulating wo scenarios:\n\nScenario 1: The merger does no occur.\n\nScenario 2: The merger occurs withou divestiture.\n\nThe comparison between he simulated prices of Scenario 1 \n\nand he observed prices measures he price effec of he \n\nmerger and he divestiture. The comparison between he \n\nsimulated prices of Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 measures he \n\nprice effec of he merger withou divestiture. Furthermore, \n\nthe model enables us o estimate changes in consumer sur­\n\nplus in response o counterfactual prices.\n\nFigure 2 shows he percentage changes in prices resulting \n\nfrom he merger with and withou he divestiture. The results \n\nindicate hat, in he absence of divestiture, he merger would \n\nhave led o price increases of around 5 percent, which corre­\n\nsponds o an increase of around 1.14 euros per kilogram. The \n\nprice changes resulting from he merger with he divestiture \n\nimposed by he European Commission are lower, resulting \n\ninstead in a price increase of approximately wo percent, or \n\nan increase of approximately 0.46 euros per kilogram. In addi­\n\ntion, he divestiture resulted in some cos efficiencies for he \n\nbuyer, which led o a price decrease of approximately 1.72 per­\n\ncent, or approximately 0.22 euros per kilogram (Figure 2).\n\n9 Due o confidentiality restrictions, specific manufacturer names canno be directly associated \n\nwith prices or marke shares.\n\nColumns (i) and (ii) of he Table show he variation in con­\n\nsumer surplus with and withou he divestiture.10 Had he \n\nEuropean Commission approved he merger withou rem­\n\nedies, he reduction in consumer surplus would have been \n\nmore pronounced han with remedies, decreasing consumer \n\nsurplus by abou 483,000 euros for sampled consumers. \n\nThe merger cleared with divestiture led o an overall reduc­\n\ntion in consumer surplus of abou 132,000 euros for sam­\n\npled consumers.\n\nThe results indicate ha although he merger reduced con­\n\nsumer surplus, his reduction is mitigated by he divesti­\n\nture. This supports he European Commission's decision \n\nto require divestiture o mitigate he anticompetitive effects \n\nof he merger. Yet, he divestiture failed both o fully pre­\n\nven negative consumer effects and o restore competition.\n\nConsidering Bargaining Power in Vertically \n\nrelated Markets is importan when requiring \n\ndivestiture\n\nWe now examine he importance of quantifying bargaining \n\npower when evaluating potential buyers of divested brands \n\nin order o effectively assess he impac of divestiture on con­\n\nsumer prices. We provide recommendations o Competition \n\nAuthorities on how o selec he buyer of he divested brand \n\nin vertical markets.\n\n10 Discrete choice models are used o calculate he change in consumer surplus; Kenneth Train, \n\n“Discrete Choice Methods with Simulation,” Second Edition.

Mergers mus be approved by Competition Authorities. \n\nA condition of merger approval is often he implementation \n\nof a divestiture.\n\nIn his report, we discuss he effectiveness of divestiture as \n\na merger remedy. We argue ha i may be less effective in \n\nvertically related industries where bargaining is a key feature \n\nof he market. If Competition Authorities ignore he inher­\n\nen imbalance in bargaining power between manufacturers \n\nand retailers when enforcing upstream divestiture, hey are \n\nlikely o implemen a policy ha does no restore competi­\n\ntion in he market.\n\nThe main reason is ha here is no a direc relationship \n\nbetween marke share and bargaining power. The bargain­\n\ning literature identifies several potential determinants of \n\nbargaining power. For example, higher bargaining power \n\nmay resul from superior brand assortment, firms' willing­\n\nness o bargain patiently, or enhanced bargaining skills. \n\nAntitrus authorities canno infer hese bargaining power \n\nvalues from observed marke shares alone, as we show ha a \n\nsmall buyer can have large bargaining power and reduce con­\n\nsumer surplus more han a large buyer with smaller bargain­\n\ning power. Therefore, an accurate estimation of hese bar­\n\ngaining weights is crucial for decisions regarding he selec­\n\ntion of he buyer for he divested brand. This has importan \n\nimplications for competition policy in Europe, bu also spe­\n\ncifically in Germany.\n\nGermany recently introduced a new amendmen o \n\nthe German Competition Act, known as he 11th GWB \n\nAmendment, ha could increase he number of divesti­\n\ntures in certain markets. Indeed, an importan aspec of \n\nthis amendmen is he introduction of a new marke inves­\n\ntigation ool ha allows for policy intervention in markets \n\nwhere here are significan and lasting distortion of com­\n\npetition withou a proven breach of competition law.11 This \n\nrepor argues ha bargaining power is a key factor ha mus \n\nbe aken into consideration.\n\n11 For more details, see Tabea Bauermeister, “New Provisions in German Competition Law: New \n\nCompetition Tool, Provisions Accompanying he DMA and a Presumption of Benefits,” Kluwer \n\n Competition Law Blog, 2023. (available online).\n\nPrecisely, we study an alternative scenario in which he \n\ndivested brand is ransferred o a differen manufacturer. \n\nThis hypothetical scenario is interesting because he alterna­\n\ntive manufacturer has a smaller marke share (1.57 percen \n\non average compared o 1.83 percen for he actual buyer) \n\nbu higher bargaining power han he actual buyer (0.41 \n\nfor he rival manufacturer compared o 0.27 for he actual \n\nbuyer). Because of he smaller marke share i would be a \n\nmore acceptable alternative for approval by he Competition \n\nAuthorities, compared o he actual buyer, when ignoring \n\nthe bargaining power.\n\nBy contrast, we find ha divesting o a small buyer – in erms \n\nof marke shares – migh no be he bes policy in vertically \n\nrelated industries. Indeed, our results sugges ha divesting \n\na brand o a small buyer with significan bargaining power is \n\nunlikely o mitigate he anti-competitive effects of he merger. \n\nIf he divested brand is bough by he alternative buyer (col­\n\numn (iii)), he negative impac on consumer surplus becomes \n\nmore pronounced with an overall decrease in consumer sur­\n\nplus of abou 149,000 euros for sampled consumers.\n\nMore broadly, he results indicate ha he actual divestiture \n\nleads o he smalles change in consumer surplus.\n\nConclusion: Bargaining Power mus be \n\nunderstood when evaluating mergers\n\nThe food supply chain is a key driver of he European econ­\n\nomy.
