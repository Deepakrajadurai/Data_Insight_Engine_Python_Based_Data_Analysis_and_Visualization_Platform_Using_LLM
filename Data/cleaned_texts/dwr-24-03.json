Thus, growth has \n\nslightly picked up again. In some of the groups of companies \n\nanalyzed, the figure was even higher. Around 23 percent \n\nof executive board members at the DAX 40 companies, \n\nfor example, are women. The largest banks and insurance \n\ncompanies, which in the past years have lagged  considerably \n\nbehind other private sector companies and companies with \n\ngovernment-owned shares, managed to catch up a bit. In \n\nmany places, this growth is due to the fact that companies \n\nhave appointed a woman to their executive board for the first \n\ntime. Beyond that, there is currently not much progress. In \n\naddition, the number of women holding the position of CEO \n\nhas decreased in many groups of companies. More commit­\n\nment is needed from companies, both internally (e.g., from \n\nthe supervisory board) and externally (e.g., from investors) to \n\nachieve gender parity in senior leadership positions.\n\nSince 2006, DIW Berlin’s Women Executives Barometer has \n\nbeen documenting the share of women1 on management \n\nboards and among managing directors (hereafter referred \n\nto as “executive boards”) as well as on supervisory, admin­\n\nistrative, and advisory boards as well as boards of trustees \n\n(hereafter “supervisory boards”) of the largest companies \n\nin Germany.2 It is also documented to what extent women \n\nhold executive board chair and executive board spokesper­\n\nson positions (hereafter “CEO”) as well as supervisory board \n\nchair positions. These shares of women are reported here \n\nfor the 200 largest companies in Germany (measured by \n\nrevenue),3 all DAX companies,4 all companies with govern­\n\nment-owned shares,5 the 100 largest banks6 (measured by \n\nbalance sheet total), and the 60 largest insurance companies7 \n\n(measured by revenue from contributions). Furthermore, \n\nthe shares of women on executive boards and supervisory \n\nboards are reported separately for the companies subject to \n\nthe gender quota on supervisory boards and for the compa­\n\nnies subject to the 2021 inclusion requirement8 for execu­\n\n1 \n\nThis Weekly Report uses a binary understanding of gender. The gender of the persons \n\n analyzed was determined using their first name, pronouns, and picture. This year, there were no \n\ncases of a person who could be identified as non-binary. However, the authors of this report are \n\naware that not every non-binary person makes their gender identity publicly known.\n\n2 Most recently in 2023, cf. Anja Kirsch, Virginia Sondergeld, and Katharina Wrohlich, “Number \n\nof women on boards of large companies keeps growing; momentum from inclusion requirement, \n\nhowever, is waning,” DIW Weekly Report, no. 3+4 (2023): 20–31 (available online. Accessed on \n\n December 15, 2023. This applies to all other online sources in this report unless stated otherwise).\n\n3 The publication “Die 100 größten Unternehmen” from the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung \n\n(July 4, 2023) was used to select the 100 and 200 highest-performing companies. Unlike its title \n\nsuggests, this publication actually contains the 200 largest companies in Germany.\n\n4 The list of listed companies in the individual DAX groups was taken from the website \n\nwww.boerse.de (in German; available online. Accessed November 24, 2023).\n\n5 The list of all companies with government-owned shares was taken from the Federal Gov­\n\nernment’s Beteiligungsbericht des Bundes 2022, which was published on February 28, 2023 (in \n\n German; available online).\n\n6 The 100 largest banks (measured by balance sheet total) were selected according to Anja \n\nU. Kraus and Harald Kuck, “Die 100 größten deutschen Kreditinstitute,” Die Bank, Zeitschrift für \n\nBankpolitik und Praxis 7 (2023): 14–25 (in German).\n\n7 The 60 largest insurance companies (measured by revenue from contributions) were  selected \n\nbased on an analysis by the Kölner Institut für Versicherungsinformation und Wirtschaftsdienste \n\n(KIVI). Additionally, the largest reinsurance companies according to the 2021 reinsurance statistics \n\n(from December 31, 2021) published by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesan­\n\nstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, BAFIN) in June 2023, were integrated into the group of the \n\n60 largest insurance companies.\n\n8 The list of companies that were subject to the gender quota on supervisory boards in fall 2023 \n\nwas kindly provided to us by FidAR e.V.\n\n19\n\nDIW Weekly Report 3/2024\n\nWOMEN EXECUTIVES BAROMETER: SHARE OF WOMEN\n\ntive boards. Altogether, the DIW Berlin Women Executives \n\nBarometer includes information on over 500 companies in \n\nGermany. The figures published here were researched from \n\nNovember 15 to November 27, 2023.9 The data are drawn \n\nfrom online company profiles, 2022 annual reports, finan­\n\ncial statements, and the German Federal Government’s 2022 \n\nBeteiligungsbericht. It also includes information from German \n\nFederal Gazette publications as well as specifc data requests \n\nmade to the companies by DIW Berlin.\n\nTop 200 companies\n\nShare of women on executive boards continues to \n\nrise, but number of women CEOs is declining\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, the share of women on the \n\nexecutive boards of the 200 largest companies (excluding the \n\nfinancial sector) was nearly 18 percent (Table 1 and Figure 1), \n\nan increase of almost two percentage points compared to \n\n9 The authors would like to thank Lana Lemke and Alina Meiner for their excellent \n\nresearch support.\n\n2022. Thus, following rather restrained growth in 2022, the \n\nshare of women has begun to increase again. Since 2018, \n\nthe share of women on the executive boards of the 200 larg­\n\nest companies has almost doubled.\n\nThe development among the top 100 companies was similar: \n\nThere, the share of women on executive boards also increased \n\nby nearly two percentage points and, as of late fall 2023, was \n\nover 19 percent. This share has also almost doubled since 2018.\n\nThe increase in the share of women on executive boards, how­\n\never, contrasts with a decline in the share of women CEOs: \n\nIn both the top 200 and the top 100 companies, the number \n\nof women CEOs fell by one person in each case. Only nine \n\n(five percent) of the 200 largest companies had a woman CEO \n\nas of fall 2023, while only four (a little over four percent) of \n\nthe 100 largest had a woman CEO.10\n\n10 Top 100: Aline Seifert (Alliance Healthcare Deutschland AG), Anna Maria Braun (B.

On average, women have made up almost one \n\nthird of supervisory board members for several years now. \n\nThe number of women leading a supervisory board among \n\nthe 200 largest companies grew from 11 in 2022 to 13, a good \n\neight percent, in late fall 2023.11 In the fourth quarter of 2023, \n\nthe 100 largest companies had seven women (eight percent) \n\nsupervisory board chairs.\n\n11 Top 200: Anna Borg (Vattenfall Deutschland), Anja Ritschel (Enercity AG), Bettina Würth \n\n(Würth-Gruppe), Cathrina Claas-Mühlhäuser (Claas KGaA mbH), Catherine Vandenborre (50Hertz \n\nTransmission GmbH), Clara C.

This share is very similar to the shares of women on \n\nthe executive boards of the 200 and 100 largest companies.\n\nHowever, this average conceals major differences between \n\nthe individual DAX groups. The largest publicly listed compa­\n\nnies, the DAX 40, have had a larger share of women on their \n\nexecutive boards than the SDAX, MDAX, and TecDAX com­\n\npanies for more than ten years (Table 2 and Table 3). There \n\nwas a particularly strong increase in the share of women at \n\nthe executive level in the DAX 40 group between 2020 and \n\n2022 from almost 15 percent to nearly 22 percent. Recently, \n\nthis momentum has slowed a bit; in the fourth quarter of \n\n2023, the share of women on the executive boards of the \n\nDAX 40 companies was 23 percent, only a good one percent­\n\nage point higher than in 2022. This means that in late fall \n\n2023, 59 of a total of 256 executive board members across the \n\n40 largest publicly listed companies were women.\n\nFigure 1\n\nShares of women and men in selected groups of companies\n\nIn percent\n\n \n\nSource: Authors’ surveys and calculations.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nThe executive boards of companies with government-owned shares experienced the most growth recently.\n\n21\n\nDIW Weekly Report 3/2024\n\nWOMEN EXECUTIVES BAROMETER: SHARE OF WOMEN\n\nThe MDAX companies, in contrast, experienced consider­\n\nably more growth: Here, the share of women on executive \n\nboards increased by nearly six percentage points and was \n\nnearly 18 percent most recently. The TecDAX companies \n\nhave developed similarly (Table 3): The share of women on \n\nexecutive boards experienced a comparatively strong increase \n\nof nearly five percentage points to around 21 percent. The \n\nshare of women on the executive boards of SDAX companies \n\ngrew much less: At a good 14 percent, the SDAX companies \n\nhave the lowest share of women executive board members \n\nof all DAX groups. Moreover, the increase was not especially \n\nlarge, at only around two percentage points.\n\nIn contast to the growth of women on executive boards, the \n\ngrowth of women CEOs was either negative or stagnated, as \n\nis the case at the 200 and 100 largest companies. While two \n\nDAX 40 companies had women CEOs in 2022, as of late fall \n\n2023, there was only one: Belén Garijo, the CEO of Merck. \n\nOne TecDAX company had a woman CEO in 2022, but as of \n\nlate fall 2023, that is no longer the case. There was no change \n\nin the MDAX and SDAX companies, where there were two \n\nand five women CEOs, respectively, as of the fourth quarter \n\nof 2023, as was the case in 2022. Comparing the DAX groups, \n\nthe SDAX companies were ahead at just over seven percent \n\nwomen CEOs, which contrasts with their comparatively low \n\nshare of women among executive board members overall.12\n\nSlight increase in the share of women on \n\nsupervisory boards of all DAX groups\n\nIn late fall 2023, the average share of women on super visory \n\nboards at all 160 DAX companies was nearly 36 percent, \n\naround two percentage points higher than in 2022.\n\nThe DAX 40 and TecDAX companies both had the greatest \n\nshare of women on supervisory boards at a good 38 percent \n\neach.

The share of women \n\nin senior public administration positions and political office \n\naffects the share of women on the supervisory boards of these \n\ncompanies due to this fact.\n\nAs in past years, companies with government-owned shares \n\nhad a considerably higher share of women on executive \n\nboards than private sector companies. In late fall 2023, over \n\none third (a good 34 percent) of all executive board members \n\n14 Companies with government-owned shares are a very heterogeneous group containing \n\nvery large companies such as Deutsche Telekom AG and Deutsche Bahn AG, but also some \n\nvery small cultural or scientifc companies, such as the Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für Sozial­\n\nforschung gGmbH (WZB), the Futurium gGMbH, or the Bayreuther Festspiele GmbH.\n\ncompanies recently experienced the most growth, with the \n\nshare of women on supervisory boards increasing by over \n\ntwo percentage points, while growth in the other DAX groups \n\nwas around one percentage point each. The share of women \n\nsupervisory board chairs did not increase, with the exception \n\nof the TecDAX companies. In contrast, the number of women \n\nsupervisory board chairs at DAX 40 companies was halved, \n\nfrom four to two. Thus, in the fourth quarter of 2023, only a \n\ngood five percent of DAX 40 companies had a woman head­\n\ning the supervisory board. The number of women supervi­\n\nsory board chairs at MDAX companies remained the same \n\n(two women – four percent). Meanwhile, there was a decline \n\namong the SDAX companies (from three to two women), \n\nand with that, the share of women supervisory board chairs \n\nwas only barely three percent as of late fall 2023. Compared \n\nto 2022, there was an additional woman supervisory board \n\nchair in the TecDAX companies. Here, two women (nearly \n\nseven percent) were supervisory board chairs in the fourth \n\nquarter of 2023.13\n\n13 DAX-40: Simone Bagel-Trah (Henkel), Clara C. Streit (Vonovia).

In addi­\n\ntion, unlike at the large companies in the private sector, the \n\nnumber of women CEOs has also continued to increase, \n\nrecently from nine to 13 women (26 percent).15\n\nIn contrast, the share of women on supervisory boards of \n\ncompanies with government-owned shares declined slightly \n\nand was recently at 39 percent (minus a good one percentage \n\npoint). Meanwhile, the share of women supervisory board \n\nchairs has increased to over 36 percent (22 women).16\n\nBanks and insurance companies: Executive \n\nboards catching up while supervisory \n\nboards stagnate\n\nThe largest companies in the financial sector, the 100 largest \n\nbanks and 60 largest insurance companies, have been lagging \n\nsignificantly behind other large private sector companies for \n\nthe past ten years in terms of the share of women on boards. \n\nRecently, however, these two groups began to catch up a bit: \n\nIn late fall 2023, the share of women on the executive boards \n\nof the 100 largest banks was nearly 17 percent (an increase \n\nof a good two percentage points) and thus similar to the fig­\n\nure in the 200 largest private sector companies (excluding \n\nthe financial sector) (Table 5). The share of women at the \n\n60 largest insurance companies even increased by almost \n\nthree percentage points to over 18 percent. There was also \n\ngrowth in the share of women CEOs in the financial sector: \n\nThe share of women CEOs at banks increased by almost four \n\npercentage points to nearly 12 percent (11 women), while the \n\nshare at insurance companies increased by around three per­\n\ncentage points to a good eight percent (five women). Thus, \n\nthe figures for banks and insurance companies were signif­\n\nicantly higher than the respective figures for the 200 or 100 \n\nlargest private sector companies.17\n\nUnlike the development on the executive boards, the share of \n\nwomen on supervisory boards in the financial sector barely \n\nincreased; however, as in the other groups of companies, the \n\nincreases occurred at a markedly higher level. The share of \n\nwomen on the supervisory boards of the 100 largest banks \n\ngrew by a good half percentage point to around 27 percent. \n\nThe share of women on the supervisory boards of the 60 \n\nlargest insurance companies in the final quarter of 2023 \n\n15 It should be noted that scientific directors of companies focused on research were counted as \n\nCEOs in this edition of the Women Executives Barometer, as they have a greater influence on the \n\ncompany’s content strategy than administrative directors.

In Germany, the share was below the EU average \n\nuntil 2021. It is only since 2022 that Germany has caught up \n\nand recorded a share of women on executive boards of the \n\nlargest publicly listed companies of a good 23 percent in 2023, \n\nthus slightly higher than the EU average of 22 percent.

This law states, among other things, that \n\npublicly listed companies with full co-determination whose \n\nexecutive board has at least four members must have at least \n\none executive board position filled by a member of the under­\n\nrepresented gender. 20 As of late fall 2023, 63 companies are \n\nrequired to comply with this regulation. These companies \n\nhad, on average, a share of a good 21 percent women on their \n\nexecutive boards (Table 6). Thus, this group of companies is \n\nbehind companies with government-owned shares (34 per­\n\ncent) and just behind the DAX 40 companies (23 percent), but \n\nis ahead of the rest of the groups examined here. The compa­\n\nnies subject to the gender quota for supervisory boards had \n\nan average share of women supervisory board members of \n\nnearly 38 percent, thus putting this group slightly behind the \n\ncompanies with government-owned shares (a solid 39 per­\n\ncent) and the DAX 40 companies (just over 38 percent), but \n\nahead of all other groups of companies.\n\nThe positive effects of the legal requirements for women on \n\nthese boards are becoming visible over time as the shares \n\nof women grow: Within the 200 largest companies, a com­\n\nparison of the companies that are subject to the supervisory \n\nboard quota with the companies not subject to it shows that \n\nthere has been a signifcantly stronger increase in the share \n\nof women in the “quota companies,” especially from 2014 to \n\n2019 as well as since 2021 (Figure 3). Since 2014, the share \n\nof women on the supervisory boards of the companies sub­\n\nject to the quota (quota companies) among the 200 largest \n\ncompanies has increased by over 17 percentage points (from \n\naround 20 to nearly 37 percent). Among the companies in the \n\ntop 200 group not subject to the quota, the share of women \n\non supervisory boards only increased by around 12 perent­\n\nage points (from almost 16 to around 28 percent) in the same \n\nperiod of time and was, as of late fall 2023, nearly ten per­\n\ncentage points lower than the share of women in the quota \n\ncompanies. There has been barely any growth in the non-\n\nquota companies over the past years, while the quota com­\n\npanies have clearly continued to strive for gender parity even \n\nafter reaching the legal minimum of 30 percent.\n\nThe inclusion requirement for executive boards introduced \n\nin 2021 is also clearly having an impact: From 2017 to 2020, \n\nthe share of women on executive boards of the companies in \n\nthe top 200 group that would later be subject to the require­\n\nment as well as those that would not be subject to the require­\n\nment developed at the same pace (Figure 4). Since it became \n\nknown in 2020 that an inclusion requirement for executive \n\nboards was coming, the companies that would become sub­\n\nject to the requirement increased the share of women on their \n\nexecutive boards much more quickly than companies in the \n\ntop 200 companies that were not subject to the requirement \n\n20 A more detailed description of the FüPoG II can be found in Anja Kirsch, Virginia Sonder-\n\ngeld, and Katharina Wrohlich, “While Gender Quotas for Top Positions In the Private Sector \n\n Differ across EU Countries, They Are Effective Overall,” DIW Weekly Report, no. 3+4 (2022): 32–39 \n\n(available online).\n\nFigure 2\n\nShare of women on top boards of the largest publicly listed \n\ncompanies in Germany and on an EU average\n\nIn percent\n\n \n\n1 In Germany, this corresponds to a supervisory board.\n\n2 In Germany, this corresponds to an executive board.\n\nSource: European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE). \n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nThe share of women on supervisory boards in Germany has long been above the \n\nEU average.

However, in this group of compa­\n\nnies, as in most of the others, the number of women remains \n\nat one. Among the 200 largest companies, for example, there \n\nis still a significant share of executive boards without a single \n\nwoman, around 44 percent. Moreover, the position of CEO \n\nremains heavily dominated by men: Only nine women were \n\nthe CEO of a top 200 company as of late fall 2023; among \n\nthe DAX 40 companies, only one woman had this position. \n\nNot only is the share of women CEOs still negligible, there is \n\nnot even an upward trend discernable—rather the opposite.\n\nMuch suggests that the introduction of an inclusion require­\n\nment for executive boards has led to the establishment of a \n\nnew social norm. The target of zero women on the executive \n\nboard set by many companies a few years ago22 has appar­\n\nently been replaced by a target of one woman on the execu­\n\ntive board. Media coverage and public debate contribute to \n\nthe formation of such an implicit quota as a social norm.23 \n\nWhile boards consisting only of men are no longer considered \n\n22 AllBright Stiftung, Zielgröße: Null Frauen.

In addition, an implicit quota \n\nseems to be emerging in other contexts such as science, cf.

Thus, growth has \n\nslightly picked up again. In some of he groups of companies \n\nanalyzed, he figure was even higher. Around 23 percen \n\nof executive board members a he DAX 40 companies, \n\nfor example, are women. The larges banks and insurance \n\ncompanies, which in he pas years have lagged considerably \n\nbehind other private sector companies and companies with \n\ngovernment-owned shares, managed o catch up a bit. In \n\nmany places, his growth is due o he fac ha companies \n\nhave appointed a woman o heir executive board for he firs \n\ntime. Beyond hat, here is currently no much progress. In \n\naddition, he number of women holding he position of CEO \n\nhas decreased in many groups of companies. More commit­\n\nmen is needed from companies, both internally (e.g., from \n\nthe supervisory board) and externally (e.g., from investors) o \n\nachieve gender parity in senior leadership positions.\n\nSince 2006, DIW Berlin’s Women Executives Barometer has \n\nbeen documenting he share of women1 on managemen \n\nboards and among managing directors (hereafter referred \n\nto as “executive boards”) as well as on supervisory, admin­\n\nistrative, and advisory boards as well as boards of rustees \n\n(hereafter “supervisory boards”) of he larges companies \n\nin Germany.2 I is also documented o wha exten women \n\nhold executive board chair and executive board spokesper­\n\nson positions (hereafter “CEO”) as well as supervisory board \n\nchair positions. These shares of women are reported here \n\nfor he 200 larges companies in Germany (measured by \n\nrevenue),3 all DAX companies,4 all companies with govern­\n\nment-owned shares,5 he 100 larges banks6 (measured by \n\nbalance shee otal), and he 60 larges insurance companies7 \n\n(measured by revenue from contributions). Furthermore, \n\nthe shares of women on executive boards and supervisory \n\nboards are reported separately for he companies subjec o \n\nthe gender quota on supervisory boards and for he compa­\n\nnies subjec o he 2021 inclusion requirement8 for execu­\n\n1 \n\nThis Weekly Repor uses a binary understanding of gender. The gender of he persons \n\n analyzed was determined using heir firs name, pronouns, and picture. This year, here were no \n\ncases of a person who could be identified as non-binary. However, he authors of his repor are \n\naware ha no every non-binary person makes heir gender identity publicly known.\n\n2 Mos recently in 2023, cf. Anja Kirsch, Virginia Sondergeld, and Katharina Wrohlich, “Number \n\nof women on boards of large companies keeps growing; momentum from inclusion requirement, \n\nhowever, is waning,” DIW Weekly Report, no. 3+4 (2023): 20–31 (available online.

This applies o all other online sources in his repor unless stated otherwise).\n\n3 The publication “Die 100 größten Unternehmen” from he Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung \n\n(July 4, 2023) was used o selec he 100 and 200 highest-performing companies.

Altogether, he DIW Berlin Women Executives \n\nBarometer includes information on over 500 companies in \n\nGermany. The figures published here were researched from \n\nNovember 15 o November 27, 2023.9 The data are drawn \n\nfrom online company profiles, 2022 annual reports, finan­\n\ncial statements, and he German Federal Government’s 2022 \n\nBeteiligungsbericht.

In addi­\n\ntion, unlike a he large companies in he private sector, he \n\nnumber of women CEOs has also continued o increase, \n\nrecently from nine o 13 women (26 percent).15\n\nIn contrast, he share of women on supervisory boards of \n\ncompanies with government-owned shares declined slightly \n\nand was recently a 39 percen (minus a good one percentage \n\npoint). Meanwhile, he share of women supervisory board \n\nchairs has increased o over 36 percen (22 women).16\n\nBanks and insurance companies: Executive \n\nboards catching up while supervisory \n\nboards stagnate\n\nThe larges companies in he financial sector, he 100 larges \n\nbanks and 60 larges insurance companies, have been lagging \n\nsignificantly behind other large private sector companies for \n\nthe pas en years in erms of he share of women on boards. \n\nRecently, however, hese wo groups began o catch up a bit: \n\nIn late fall 2023, he share of women on he executive boards \n\nof he 100 larges banks was nearly 17 percen (an increase \n\nof a good wo percentage points) and hus similar o he fig­\n\nure in he 200 larges private sector companies (excluding \n\nthe financial sector) (Table 5). The share of women a he \n\n60 larges insurance companies even increased by almos \n\nthree percentage points o over 18 percent.

Thus, \n\nthe figures for banks and insurance companies were signif­\n\nicantly higher han he respective figures for he 200 or 100 \n\nlarges private sector companies.17\n\nUnlike he developmen on he executive boards, he share of \n\nwomen on supervisory boards in he financial sector barely \n\nincreased; however, as in he other groups of companies, he \n\nincreases occurred a a markedly higher level. The share of \n\nwomen on he supervisory boards of he 100 larges banks \n\ngrew by a good half percentage poin o around 27 percent. \n\nThe share of women on he supervisory boards of he 60 \n\nlarges insurance companies in he final quarter of 2023 \n\n15 I should be noted ha scientific directors of companies focused on research were counted as \n\nCEOs in his edition of he Women Executives Barometer, as hey have a greater influence on he \n\ncompany’s conten strategy han administrative directors.
