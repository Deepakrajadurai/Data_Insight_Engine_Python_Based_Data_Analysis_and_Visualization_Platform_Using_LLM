An analysis of 321 sovereign debt restructur­\n\nings since 1815 shows that foreign private and institutional \n\ninvestor losses were 43 percent on average. Notably, begin­\n\nning in the 1970s, several debt exchanges have increasingly \n\nbeen required to resolve a default. To understand this new \n\nphenomenon better, this Weekly Report looks at total creditor \n\nlosses across all restructurings during a default spell. Instead \n\nof focusing on each individual restructuring, the cumula­\n\ntive haircut adds up all losses across a default spell. These \n\ncalculations show that debt crises with serial restructurings \n\nresulted in greater overall losses for creditors than a major \n\none-off restructuring. The results conclude that it makes sense \n\nto perform a debt sustainability analysis independently and in \n\na timely manner when determining the size of a haircut. This \n\ncould lessen debt restructurings with shallow haircuts that do \n\nnot manage to bring countries back to their sustainable debt \n\npath.\n\nDefaults tend to be painful for debtors and creditors alike. \n\nSovereign debtors may lose access to the international cap­\n\nital market, fall into a protracted recession, or suffer from \n\nsocial upheavals, while private and institutional creditors gen­\n\nerally must accept losses in their portfolios sooner or later.\n\nThere has still been comparatively little research on the mag­\n\nnitude of a debt crisis on debtors and creditors. Unlike other \n\ncrises, such as currency crashes, inflation, or banking cri­\n\nses, debt crises are generally characterized in a binary man­\n\nner, i.e., did a crisis occur or not, irrespective of whether the \n\ncrisis was resolved with minor or total losses for investors.\n\nMoving beyond a simple characterization of sovereign debt \n\ncrises, this Weekly Report examines the history of defaults \n\nsince 1815 using a comprehensive dataset.1 It focuses on the \n\namount lost by creditors, also known as haircuts.2 Moreover, \n\nthis Weekly Report takes a closer look at the new phenom­\n\nenon of serial restructurings and its relationship to the size \n\nof creditor losses.3 Serial restructurings should not be con­\n\nfused with serial default. Usually, serial restructurings occur \n\nwithin a single default spell when the earlier restructuring \n\ndeals do not provide enough debt reduction to place the coun­\n\ntry on a sustainable debt path.4 A default spell is considered \n\nfinal when no further defaults occur within two years after \n\nthe last default.\n\n1 \n\nThis Weekly Report is based on a paper for the 24th Jacques Polak Annual Research Confer­\n\nence of the International Monetary Fund.

Accessed on January 22, 2024. This applies to all other online sources in this re­\n\nport unless otherwise noted).\n\n2 The data are based on work by Juan J. Cruces and Christoph Trebesch, “Sovereign Defaults: \n\nThe Price of Haircuts,” American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics 5, no. 3 (2013): 85-117;  Josefin \n\nMeyer, Carmen M. Reinhart, and Christoph Trebesch, “Soverign Bonds Since Waterloo,” The \n\n Quarterly Journal of Economics 137, no. 3 (2022): 1615-1680. The analysis follows in the tradition of \n\nCarmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, “The Aftermath of Financial Crises,” American Economic \n\nReview 99, no. 2 (2009): 466-472.\n\n3 The paper this Weekly Report is based on also investigates how much creditors lose during \n\ndebt crises that are related to geopolitical shocks (wars, revolutions, empires breaking up), major \n\nexternal debt, or low per capita income of debtor countries, cf. Graf von Luckner et al., “Sovereign \n\nDebt.”\n\n4 The term “serial restructuring” refers to two or more debt exchanges within a single default \n\nspell, cf. Carmen M. Reinhart, Kenneth S. Rogoff, and Miguel A. Savastano, “Debt Intolerance,” \n\nBrookings Papers on Economic Activity, no. 23, 1 (2003) (available online).\n\n47\n\nDIW Weekly Report 6/2024\n\nSOVEREIGN DEBT CRISES\n\n321 restructurings over the past 200 years\n\nThe analysis considers the period from 1815 to 2020 and \n\nincludes 200 default spells of countries on external debt \n\ninstruments with a total of 321 debt restructurings (Figure 1). \n\nThese instruments are held by private external creditors \n\nsuch as foreign or institutional investors like funds, insur­\n\ners, and commercial banks (e.g., the London Club creditor \n\nbanks during the 1970s or 1980s).5 Domestic or external offi­\n\ncial creditors are excluded.\n\nA default occurs when either the sovereign debtor misses \n\ndebt payments beyond the grace period or when there are \n\nchanges to the debt contract that are less favorable for the \n\ncreditor, for example if an existing financial instrument such \n\nas a government bond or loan is exchanged for a new one. \n\nThese restructurings mostly occur in the context or geopo­\n\nlitical or domestic political crises.\n\nIn this Weekly Report, the calculation of haircuts is limited to \n\ndefaults and restructurings of medium and long-term debts. \n\nRestructurings that are solely involved with short-term debt, \n\nsuch as short-term credit line maintenance, 90-day debt roll­\n\novers, or instances of short-term maturity extension of less \n\nthan a year are excluded.\n\nFor cases where there are serial debt restructurings occur­\n\nring close together, they must be aggregated to quantify the \n\nfull extent of creditor losses between the start of debt distress \n\nand when it is resolved. To do so, the Bulow-Rogoff haircut \n\n(BR) is introduced, named after Jeremy Bulow and Kenneth \n\nRogoff (Box). Only observing individual haircuts could dis­\n\ntort the creditor losses. However, the BR method captures \n\nthe dynamic aspects of multiple debt exchanges by aggre­\n\ngating the creditor losses. For example, during its debt cri­\n\nsis in the 1980s, Brazil recorded six individual haircuts (from \n\nnine percent in 1983 to 29 percent in 1994). The cumulative \n\nhaircut according to the BR method during this 13-year-long \n\ndefault spell was 46.6 percent.\n\nThere is a large heterogeneity in the size of \n\nhaircuts\n\nAverage investor losses are around 43 percent per restruc­\n\nturing. According to the BR method, this figure was as high \n\nas 47 percent for each default spell (Table). Over the past \n\n200 years, there have been around a dozen cases in which \n\nhaircuts were negative. In these cases, the net present value \n\nafter the debt exchange was higher than before. This can \n\nhappen, for example, when sovereigns extend debt maturi­\n\nties at higher interest rates than in the previous contract in \n\nadvance to avoid a default. Such debt restructurings are rare \n\nand almost always occur during the earlier stages of a crisis. \n\n5 The London Club is an informal group of banks that generally act as creditors to emerging \n\nmarkets. These banks coordinate and represent their common interests and concerns related to \n\ntheir loan and financial relationships to these countries.\n\nFigure 1\n\nSelected debt crises and restructurings worldwide from \n\n1815 to 2020\n\nBy country in alphabetical order\n\n \n\nNotes: The selection was limited to debt crises in 46 countries. In total, 91 countries have been affected by sovereign \n\ndebt crises over the past 200 years. A default spell is considered final when no further defaults have occurred within \n\ntwo years after the default has been settled.\n\nSource: Authors’ calculations based on Graf von Luckner et al., “Sovereign Debt: 200 years of creditor losses.”\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nWhile there have been more restructurings worldwide in the past decades, there \n\nhave been fewer long default spells.\n\n48\n\nDIW Weekly Report 6/2024\n\nSOVEREIGN DEBT CRISES\n\nThey can be advantageous for the state in the short term, as \n\nextending the terms may smooth out repayment and miti­\n\ngate acute refinancing risks.\n\nThe other extreme is a full repudiation. Ten of the debt \n\nrestructurings discussed here fall into this category. Mostly, \n\nthese extreme cases are related to geopolitical turbulence \n\nor revolutions in which legislative or executive authorities \n\ndeclare the defaulted debt as illegitimate, such as happened \n\nafter the Russian revolution in 1917 or after the Chinese \n\ndefault in 1949.\n\nSerial restructurings are increasingly common\n\nDefaults often require multiple rounds of debt restructur­\n\ning until they are settled. On average, 1.6 restructurings are \n\nneeded to settle a default, with some cases requiring as many \n\nas seven distinct restructurings (Figure 2). More than one \n\nthird of the 200 default spells covered required two or more \n\nrestructurings to cure the default.\n\nWhen observing the entire history of defaults and debt \n\nrestructurings, serial restructurings have become more \n\nimportant in past decades (Figure 3). This could be due to \n\nthe changes in institutional and contractual frameworks. For \n\nexample, the introduction of collective action clauses could \n\nhave improved restructuring coordination.6\n\nThe increase in interim restructurings is accompanied by \n\nshorter default spells (bottom of Figure 3). In the 19th century \n\nduring the long nation-building process in Latin America \n\nand Europe, defaults often stretched out over decades, such \n\nas in the case of Greece from 1824 to 1878. These defaults \n\nwere delayed by events such as border wars, internal revolu­\n\ntions, and disarray.7 In the later 19th century and early 20th \n\ncentury, political conditions stabilized. At the same time, \n\ndefault spells also became shorter.\n\nDefault spells became even shorter in the beginning of the \n\n1970s. At the same time, multilateral institutions increased \n\ntheir involvement in emerging markets and developing coun­\n\ntries. However, defaults now typically involve more interim \n\nrestructuring deals, which often see low haircuts (Figure 3).8 \n\nWhether shorter default spells with multiple restructurings \n\nare associated with fewer creditor losses will be investigated \n\nin the following section.\n\n6 Collective action clauses (CACs) are contractual conditions of bonds (debt securities) that \n\nenable a majority of creditors to change the conditions of debt securities, even if not all creditors \n\nagree. CACs are often used in international bonds or bonds of emerging markets.\n\n7 Miguel Angel Centeno, Blood and debt: War and the nation-state in Latin America (Penn State \n\nPress: 2002).\n\n8 For a historical perspective on the changing mission of the International Monetary Fund, cf. \n\nCarmen M.

To calculate the net present value (NPV) haircut Hi,t for \n\na restructuring i at time t, the net present value of the contractual \n\npayment streams of the new debt issued during the restructuring \n\nis compared with the NPV of the old debt in default, accounting for \n\narrears and cash payments.\n\n \n\nThe new financial instruments such as government bonds or loans \n\ndiffer from the old ones typically in either one or in all three dimen­\n\nsions: the interest rate, maturity, and face value of the obligation. \n\nThis metric accounts for the characteristics of both old and new \n\ndebt as well as any changes in maturity and interest structure. The \n\nhaircut calculated compares the present value of the new and the \n\nold debt in a hypothetical scenario in which the country continues \n\nto pay any remaining outstanding “old” debts as if no default had \n\noccurred with what the country must pay with the newly issued \n\ndebt. Both payment streams are discounted using the same inter­\n\nest rate.1\n\nFor cases in which there is more than one debt restructuring, hair­\n\ncuts must be aggregated over the multiple restructurings with the \n\naim of quantifying the full creditor losses between the start of debt \n\ndistress and when it is finally resolved.\n\n1 \n\nData on restructuring and haircuts for 1815 to 1970 are from Meyer, Reinhart, and Trebesch, \n\n“Sovereign Bonds Since Waterloo;” for 1970 to 1998, Cruces und Trebesch, “Sovereign Defaults;” \n\nand for 2017 to 2022, Asonuma Toman and Christoph Trebesch, “Sovereign Debt  Restructurings: \n\nPreemptive or Post-Default,” Journal of the European Economic Association 14, no. 1 (2016): \n\n175–214 as well as Chuck Fang, Julian Schumacher, and Christoph Trebesch, “Restructuring \n\n Sovereign Bonds: Holdouts, Haircuts and the Effectiveness of CACs,” IMF Economic Review 69 \n\n(2021): 155–196 for 1999 to 2016, and Graf von Luckner et al., “Sovereign Debt.”\n\nThe Bulow-Rogoff haircut2 is used to estimate the cumulative cred­\n\nitor losses of serial debt restructurings during a single default spell. \n\nThis cumulative metric captures the compound loss experienced \n\nby a passive investor who held a portfolio of all the securities or \n\nloans placed by the country, including those restructured in the \n\nprevious debt restructuring deals. Specifically, for the final restruc­\n\nturing event i, the Bulow-Rogoff haircut can be computed as:\n\n \n\nwhere J − 1 represents the number of interim  restructuring \n\ndeals that occurred before the final restructuring deal i. \n\n \n\n denotes the wealth conservation ratio in the jth restruc­\n\nturing event. The wealth conservation ratio, or recovery rate, is \n\ndefined as 1 minus the effective estimated haircut for the restruc­\n\nturing event and is derived from debt data to private creditors at \n\ntime t.\n\nThe BR haircut allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the long-\n\nterm cumulative creditor losses due to serial restructurings. It is \n\nuseful when comparing across eras with different restructuring \n\nmodalities. The BR haircut is particularly pertinent when there \n\nare numerous interim restructurings with low haircuts that were \n\nfollowed by follow-up deals with deeper haircuts in the same de­\n\nfault spell, as was the case during the 1980s in Brazil and Poland \n\n(Figure 1). Observing haircuts individually would distort creditor \n\nlosses, as it gives too much weight to interim low-haircut deals \n\nwhere the share of debt covered by the exchange also tends to be \n\nmuch lower. It can markedly understate creditor losses during a \n\nperiod when serial restructurings were commonplace. The BR hair­\n\ncut captures the dynamic aspect of serial debt exchanges, offering \n\na unified summary of creditor losses.\n\n2 Cf. Jeremy Bulow and Kenneth Rogoff, “A constant recontracting model of sovereign debt,” \n\nJournal of Political Economy 97, no. 1 (1989): 155–178.\n\n50\n\nDIW Weekly Report 6/2024\n\nSOVEREIGN DEBT CRISES\n\n1998 (51 percent) compared to the previous decades (46 per­\n\ncent) (Table).\n\nConclusion: Debt sustainability analysis could \n\nhelp to find the optimal haircut\n\nResearch thus far has focused on haircuts in each individual \n\nrestructuring separately instead of considering the full crisis \n\nspell when calculating creditor losses. Considering the entire \n\ndefault spell, average cumulative creditor losses are signifi­\n\ncantly higher in cases of serial restructurings. Despite serial \n\nrestructurings, it is often not possible to establish a sustain­\n\nable debt trajectory to settle the default. One possible rea­\n\nson for this is that restructurings were too low or happened \n\ntoo late, setting the stage for ongoing sovereign debt crisis. \n\nOther reasons can include emerging domestic and foreign \n\npolitical upheavals or overly optimistic economic predic­\n\ntions.9 As defaults occur for a variety of reasons, often with \n\n9 For a further analysis of the reasons, see Christoph Trebesch et al., “External sovereign debt \n\nrestructurings: Delay and replay,” VoxEU column, March 30, 2021 (available online).\n\nInterim restructurings have smaller haircuts than \n\nfinal restructurings\n\nThe 321 individual restructurings of the 200 default spells \n\ncan be divided into two groups: restructurings that could \n\nsettle a sovereign default (final restructurings) and restruc­\n\nturings that could not end the default spell (interim restruc­\n\nturings). At 30 percent, interim restructurings have a signif­\n\nicantly lower median haircut size compared to final restruc­\n\nturings at 50 percent (Figure 4). The distribution of interim \n\nrestructurings is concentrated strongly in the lower area: \n\nThe majority of creditor losses from interim restructurings \n\nare between 20 to 40 percent. In comparison, final restruc­\n\nturings have a more even distribution of haircuts across the \n\nentire spectrum of creditor losses.\n\nHowever, the analysis shows that the more restructurings \n\nrequired, the higher the total creditor losses (Figure 5). The \n\nfirst restructuring shows haircuts with creditor losses of a bit \n\nover 40 percent, while creditors accumulate average losses \n\nof 60 percent under defaults with three or more restructur­\n\nings. Cumulative creditor losses are higher on average after \n\nFigure 4\n\nDistribution of creditor losses resulting from \n\ninterim and final restructurings since 1815\n\nIn percent1\n\n \n\n1 The green area represents the accumulation of the respective debt restructuring in \n\nthe mean distribution. The black line indicates the median. Negative values arise when \n\ncreditors make profits through crisis-related contract adjustments. This could happen, for \n\nexample, when countries extend the maturity of their debts and, in return, accept higher \n\ninterest rates than in the previous agreement.\n\nSource: Authors’ calculations based on Graf von Luckner et al., “Sovereign Debt: 200 years \n\nof creditor losses.”\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nRestructurings with low creditor losses have mostly not led to an \n\nend of a debt crisis.\n\nFigure 3\n\nRestructurings by time period\n\nNumber of restructurings and length of crisis in years\n\n \n\nNote: A default spell is considered final when no further defaults have occurred within two years after the default has \n\nbeen settled.\n\nSource: Authors’ calculations based on Graf von Luckner et al., “Sovereign Debt: 200 years of creditor losses.”\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nThe number of restructurings per debt crisis may have increased after 1970, but the \n\nlength of sovereign debt crises has become considerably shorter.\n\n51\n\nDIW Weekly Report 6/2024\n\nSOVEREIGN DEBT CRISES\n\nmultiple factors at play, it is difficult to make causal conclu­\n\nsions about a default settlement based on the number of \n\nrestructurings and the size of the haircuts. The results here \n\nsimply show that in many cases, the initial debt restructur­\n\ning terms are not enough to put a country’s debt onto a sus­\n\ntainable debt path.\n\nIn the interests of all parties involved, debtors should not end \n\nup with more debt nor creditors with a worse portfolio due \n\nto incorrect assumptions about debt sustainability. Thus, it \n\nis important to determine the correct size of the haircut at \n\nthe right time to limit creditor losses and to keep the coun­\n\ntry’s default spell relatively short.\n\nInternational institutions can help to reduce the probabil­\n\nity of unsustainable debt restructuring with low haircuts \n\nby providing realistic evaluations in their debt sustainabil­\n\nity analyses.

An analysis of 321 sovereign deb restructur­\n\nings since 1815 shows ha foreign private and institutional \n\ninvestor losses were 43 percen on average. Notably, begin­\n\nning in he 1970s, several deb exchanges have increasingly \n\nbeen required o resolve a default. To understand his new \n\nphenomenon be er, his Weekly Repor looks a otal creditor \n\nlosses across all restructurings during a defaul spell. Instead \n\nof focusing on each individual restructuring, he cumula­\n\ntive haircu adds up all losses across a defaul spell. These \n\ncalculations show ha deb crises with serial restructurings \n\nresulted in greater overall losses for creditors han a major \n\none-off restructuring. The results conclude ha i makes sense \n\nto perform a deb sustainability analysis independently and in \n\na imely manner when determining he size of a haircut. This \n\ncould lessen deb restructurings with shallow haircuts ha do \n\nno manage o bring countries back o heir sustainable deb \n\npath.\n\nDefaults end o be painful for debtors and creditors alike. \n\nSovereign debtors may lose access o he international cap­\n\nital market, fall into a protracted recession, or suffer from \n\nsocial upheavals, while private and institutional creditors gen­\n\nerally mus accep losses in heir portfolios sooner or later.\n\nThere has still been comparatively li le research on he mag­\n\nnitude of a deb crisis on debtors and creditors. Unlike other \n\ncrises, such as currency crashes, inflation, or banking cri­\n\nses, deb crises are generally characterized in a binary man­\n\nner, i.e., did a crisis occur or not, irrespective of whether he \n\ncrisis was resolved with minor or otal losses for investors.\n\nMoving beyond a simple characterization of sovereign deb \n\ncrises, his Weekly Repor examines he history of defaults \n\nsince 1815 using a comprehensive dataset.1 I focuses on he \n\namoun los by creditors, also known as haircuts.2 Moreover, \n\nthis Weekly Repor akes a closer look a he new phenom­\n\nenon of serial restructurings and its relationship o he size \n\nof creditor losses.3 Serial restructurings should no be con­\n\nfused with serial default. Usually, serial restructurings occur \n\nwithin a single defaul spell when he earlier restructuring \n\ndeals do no provide enough deb reduction o place he coun­\n\ntry on a sustainable deb path.4 A defaul spell is considered \n\nfinal when no further defaults occur within wo years after \n\nthe las default.\n\n1 \n\nThis Weekly Repor is based on a paper for he 24th Jacques Polak Annual Research Confer­\n\nence of he International Monetary Fund.

Cruces and Christoph Trebesch, “Sovereign Defaults: \n\nThe Price of Haircuts,” American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics 5, no. 3 (2013): 85-117; Josefin \n\nMeyer, Carmen M.

Reinhar and Kenneth Rogoff, “The Aftermath of Financial Crises,” American Economic \n\nReview 99, no. 2 (2009): 466-472.\n\n3 The paper his Weekly Repor is based on also investigates how much creditors lose during \n\ndeb crises ha are related o geopolitical shocks (wars, revolutions, empires breaking up), major \n\nexternal debt, or low per capita income of debtor countries, cf. Graf von Luckner e al., “Sovereign \n\nDebt.”\n\n4 The erm “serial restructuring” refers o wo or more deb exchanges within a single defaul \n\nspell, cf. Carmen M. Reinhart, Kenneth S. Rogoff, and Miguel A. Savastano, “Deb Intolerance,” \n\nBrookings Papers on Economic Activity, no. 23, 1 (2003) (available online).\n\n47\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 6/2024\n\nSOVEREIGN DEBT CRISES\n\n321 restructurings over he pas 200 years\n\nThe analysis considers he period from 1815 o 2020 and \n\nincludes 200 defaul spells of countries on external deb \n\ninstruments with a otal of 321 deb restructurings (Figure 1). \n\nThese instruments are held by private external creditors \n\nsuch as foreign or institutional investors like funds, insur­\n\ners, and commercial banks (e.g., he London Club creditor \n\nbanks during he 1970s or 1980s).5 Domestic or external offi­\n\ncial creditors are excluded.\n\nA defaul occurs when either he sovereign debtor misses \n\ndeb payments beyond he grace period or when here are \n\nchanges o he deb contrac ha are less favorable for he \n\ncreditor, for example if an existing financial instrumen such \n\nas a governmen bond or loan is exchanged for a new one. \n\nThese restructurings mostly occur in he contex or geopo­\n\nlitical or domestic political crises.\n\nIn his Weekly Report, he calculation of haircuts is limited o \n\ndefaults and restructurings of medium and long-term debts. \n\nRestructurings ha are solely involved with short-term debt, \n\nsuch as short-term credi line maintenance, 90-day deb roll­\n\novers, or instances of short-term maturity extension of less \n\nthan a year are excluded.\n\nFor cases where here are serial deb restructurings occur­\n\nring close ogether, hey mus be aggregated o quantify he \n\nfull exten of creditor losses between he star of deb distress \n\nand when i is resolved. To do so, he Bulow-Rogoff haircu \n\n(BR) is introduced, named after Jeremy Bulow and Kenneth \n\nRogoff (Box). Only observing individual haircuts could dis­\n\ntor he creditor losses. However, he BR method captures \n\nthe dynamic aspects of multiple deb exchanges by aggre­\n\ngating he creditor losses. For example, during its deb cri­\n\nsis in he 1980s, Brazil recorded six individual haircuts (from \n\nnine percen in 1983 o 29 percen in 1994). The cumulative \n\nhaircu according o he BR method during his 13-year-long \n\ndefaul spell was 46.6 percent.\n\nThere is a large heterogeneity in he size of \n\nhaircuts\n\nAverage investor losses are around 43 percen per restruc­\n\nturing. According o he BR method, his figure was as high \n\nas 47 percen for each defaul spell (Table). Over he pas \n\n200 years, here have been around a dozen cases in which \n\nhaircuts were negative. In hese cases, he ne presen value \n\nafter he deb exchange was higher han before. This can \n\nhappen, for example, when sovereigns extend deb maturi­\n\nties a higher interes rates han in he previous contrac in \n\nadvance o avoid a default. Such deb restructurings are rare \n\nand almos always occur during he earlier stages of a crisis. \n\n5 The London Club is an informal group of banks ha generally ac as creditors o emerging \n\nmarkets. These banks coordinate and represen heir common interests and concerns related o \n\ntheir loan and financial relationships o hese countries.\n\nFigure 1\n\nSelected deb crises and restructurings worldwide from \n\n1815 o 2020\n\nBy country in alphabetical order\n\n \n\nNotes: The selection was limited o deb crises in 46 countries. In otal, 91 countries have been affected by sovereign \n\ndeb crises over he pas 200 years. A defaul spell is considered final when no further defaults have occurred within \n\ntwo years after he defaul has been se led.\n\nSource: Authors’ calculations based on Graf von Luckner e al., “Sovereign Debt: 200 years of creditor losses.”\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nWhile here have been more restructurings worldwide in he pas decades, here \n\nhave been fewer long defaul spells.\n\n48\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 6/2024\n\nSOVEREIGN DEBT CRISES\n\nThey can be advantageous for he state in he shor erm, as \n\nextending he erms may smooth ou repaymen and miti­\n\ngate acute refinancing risks.\n\nThe other extreme is a full repudiation. Ten of he deb \n\nrestructurings discussed here fall into his category. Mostly, \n\nthese extreme cases are related o geopolitical urbulence \n\nor revolutions in which legislative or executive authorities \n\ndeclare he defaulted deb as illegitimate, such as happened \n\nafter he Russian revolution in 1917 or after he Chinese \n\ndefaul in 1949.\n\nSerial restructurings are increasingly common\n\nDefaults often require multiple rounds of deb restructur­\n\ning until hey are se led. On average, 1.6 restructurings are \n\nneeded o se le a default, with some cases requiring as many \n\nas seven distinc restructurings (Figure 2). More han one \n\nthird of he 200 defaul spells covered required wo or more \n\nrestructurings o cure he default.\n\nWhen observing he entire history of defaults and deb \n\nrestructurings, serial restructurings have become more \n\nimportan in pas decades (Figure 3). This could be due o \n\nthe changes in institutional and contractual frameworks. For \n\nexample, he introduction of collective action clauses could \n\nhave improved restructuring coordination.6\n\nThe increase in interim restructurings is accompanied by \n\nshorter defaul spells (bo om of Figure 3). In he 19th century \n\nduring he long nation-building process in Latin America \n\nand Europe, defaults often stretched ou over decades, such \n\nas in he case of Greece from 1824 o 1878. These defaults \n\nwere delayed by events such as border wars, internal revolu­\n\ntions, and disarray.7 In he later 19th century and early 20th \n\ncentury, political conditions stabilized. A he same ime, \n\ndefaul spells also became shorter.\n\nDefaul spells became even shorter in he beginning of he \n\n1970s. A he same ime, multilateral institutions increased \n\ntheir involvemen in emerging markets and developing coun­\n\ntries. However, defaults now ypically involve more interim \n\nrestructuring deals, which often see low haircuts (Figure 3).8 \n\nWhether shorter defaul spells with multiple restructurings \n\nare associated with fewer creditor losses will be investigated \n\nin he following section.\n\n6 Collective action clauses (CACs) are contractual conditions of bonds (deb securities) ha \n\nenable a majority of creditors o change he conditions of deb securities, even if no all creditors \n\nagree. CACs are often used in international bonds or bonds of emerging markets.\n\n7 Miguel Angel Centeno, Blood and debt: War and he nation-state in Latin America (Penn State \n\nPress: 2002).\n\n8 For a historical perspective on he changing mission of he International Monetary Fund, cf. \n\nCarmen M.

To calculate he ne presen value (NPV) haircu Hi, for \n\na restructuring i a ime , he ne presen value of he contractual \n\npaymen streams of he new deb issued during he restructuring \n\nis compared with he NPV of he old deb in default, accounting for \n\narrears and cash payments.\n\n \n\nThe new financial instruments such as governmen bonds or loans \n\ndiffer from he old ones ypically in either one or in all hree dimen­\n\nsions: he interes rate, maturity, and face value of he obligation. \n\nThis metric accounts for he characteristics of both old and new \n\ndeb as well as any changes in maturity and interes structure. The \n\nhaircu calculated compares he presen value of he new and he \n\nold deb in a hypothetical scenario in which he country continues \n\nto pay any remaining outstanding “old” debts as if no defaul had \n\noccurred with wha he country mus pay with he newly issued \n\ndebt. Both paymen streams are discounted using he same inter­\n\nes rate.1\n\nFor cases in which here is more han one deb restructuring, hair­\n\ncuts mus be aggregated over he multiple restructurings with he \n\naim of quantifying he full creditor losses between he star of deb \n\ndistress and when i is finally resolved.\n\n1 \n\nData on restructuring and haircuts for 1815 o 1970 are from Meyer, Reinhart, and Trebesch, \n\n“Sovereign Bonds Since Waterloo;” for 1970 o 1998, Cruces und Trebesch, “Sovereign Defaults;” \n\nand for 2017 o 2022, Asonuma Toman and Christoph Trebesch, “Sovereign Deb Restructurings: \n\nPreemptive or Post-Default,” Journal of he European Economic Association 14, no. 1 (2016): \n\n175–214 as well as Chuck Fang, Julian Schumacher, and Christoph Trebesch, “Restructuring \n\n Sovereign Bonds: Holdouts, Haircuts and he Effectiveness of CACs,” IMF Economic Review 69 \n\n(2021): 155–196 for 1999 o 2016, and Graf von Luckner e al., “Sovereign Debt.”\n\nThe Bulow-Rogoff haircut2 is used o estimate he cumulative cred­\n\nitor losses of serial deb restructurings during a single defaul spell. \n\nThis cumulative metric captures he compound loss experienced \n\nby a passive investor who held a portfolio of all he securities or \n\nloans placed by he country, including hose restructured in he \n\nprevious deb restructuring deals. Specifically, for he final restruc­\n\nturing even i, he Bulow-Rogoff haircu can be computed as:\n\n \n\nwhere J − 1 represents he number of interim restructuring \n\ndeals ha occurred before he final restructuring deal i. \n\n \n\n denotes he wealth conservation ratio in he jth restruc­\n\nturing event. The wealth conservation ratio, or recovery rate, is \n\ndefined as 1 minus he effective estimated haircu for he restruc­\n\nturing even and is derived from deb data o private creditors a \n\ntime .\n\nThe BR haircu allows for a comprehensive evaluation of he long-\n\nterm cumulative creditor losses due o serial restructurings. I is \n\nuseful when comparing across eras with differen restructuring \n\nmodalities. The BR haircu is particularly pertinen when here \n\nare numerous interim restructurings with low haircuts ha were \n\nfollowed by follow-up deals with deeper haircuts in he same de­\n\nfaul spell, as was he case during he 1980s in Brazil and Poland \n\n(Figure 1). Observing haircuts individually would distor creditor \n\nlosses, as i gives oo much weigh o interim low-haircu deals \n\nwhere he share of deb covered by he exchange also ends o be \n\nmuch lower. I can markedly understate creditor losses during a \n\nperiod when serial restructurings were commonplace. The BR hair­\n\ncu captures he dynamic aspec of serial deb exchanges, offering \n\na unified summary of creditor losses.\n\n2 Cf.

Considering he entire \n\ndefaul spell, average cumulative creditor losses are signifi­\n\ncantly higher in cases of serial restructurings. Despite serial \n\nrestructurings, i is often no possible o establish a sustain­\n\nable deb rajectory o se le he default. One possible rea­\n\nson for his is ha restructurings were oo low or happened \n\ntoo late, se ing he stage for ongoing sovereign deb crisis. \n\nOther reasons can include emerging domestic and foreign \n\npolitical upheavals or overly optimistic economic predic­\n\ntions.9 As defaults occur for a variety of reasons, often with \n\n9 For a further analysis of he reasons, see Christoph Trebesch e al., “External sovereign deb \n\nrestructurings: Delay and replay,” VoxEU column, March 30, 2021 (available online).\n\nInterim restructurings have smaller haircuts han \n\nfinal restructurings\n\nThe 321 individual restructurings of he 200 defaul spells \n\ncan be divided into wo groups: restructurings ha could \n\nse le a sovereign defaul (final restructurings) and restruc­\n\nturings ha could no end he defaul spell (interim restruc­\n\nturings). A 30 percent, interim restructurings have a signif­\n\nicantly lower median haircu size compared o final restruc­\n\nturings a 50 percen (Figure 4). The distribution of interim \n\nrestructurings is concentrated strongly in he lower area: \n\nThe majority of creditor losses from interim restructurings \n\nare between 20 o 40 percent. In comparison, final restruc­\n\nturings have a more even distribution of haircuts across he \n\nentire spectrum of creditor losses.\n\nHowever, he analysis shows ha he more restructurings \n\nrequired, he higher he otal creditor losses (Figure 5). The \n\nfirs restructuring shows haircuts with creditor losses of a bi \n\nover 40 percent, while creditors accumulate average losses \n\nof 60 percen under defaults with hree or more restructur­\n\nings.
