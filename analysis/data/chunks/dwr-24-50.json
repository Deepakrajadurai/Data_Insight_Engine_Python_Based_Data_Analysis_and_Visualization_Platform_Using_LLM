    "Economic Outlook: German economy stuck in limbo while rade conflicts hreaten he global economy By Geraldine Dany-Knedlik, Guido Baldi, Nina Maria Brehl, Hella Engerer, Angelina Hackmann, Pia Hü l, Konstantin Kholodilin, Frederik Kurcz, Laura Pagenhardt, Jan-Christopher Scherer, Teresa Schildmann, Hannah Magdalena Seidl, Ruben Staffa, and Kristin Trautmann EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The German economy is stuck in a difficul position as i faces both slow growth as well as structural change. The continuing lack of orders in manufacturing, increasing international competition, and sluggish developmen in industry-related services are now affecting he labor mar­ ke and leading no only o short-time work bu o layoffs too, despite he continuing skilled worker shortage. While GDP increased slightly by 0.1 percen in he hird quarter of 2023, his growth was preceded by a stronger han initially recorded decline in economic outpu of 0.3 percen in he second quarter. Thus, he German economy canno be said o be on a stable growth path. In contrast, leading indicators sugges ha economic outpu will decline again in he fourth quarter, with overall growth for 2024 likely o be 0.2 percent. This means ha he German economy will contrac for he second year in a row. German industry in particular is experiencing a serious crisis. Foreign rade may emporarily benefit, as many com­ panies despite a lack of demand are expected o increase their exports o he United States in order o ge ahead of the possible ariffs ha US President-elec Donald Trump announced. However, impending protectionis measures are already having an impac and unse ling local compa­ nies, which are herefore postponing investments further. In addition, he economic framework conditions in Ger­ many are unclear and will remain unpredictable until a leas he spring when here is a new federal government. All of hese factors in conjunction with increasing concerns abou heir own jobs are unse ling households in Ger­ many, resulting in private consumption failing o pick up speed despite rising real wages. A gradual easing is no expected until mid-2025, when domestic and foreign economic uncertainties will succes­ sively lessen. Nevertheless, he German economy should expand by 0.2 percen in 2025. Thus, DIW Berlin is revis­ ing its fall forecas downward by 0.7 percentage points. Economic outpu is expected o increase by 1.2 percen in 2026, although his is partially due o non-recurring effects such as a relatively high number of work days. In regard o he global economy, he boom in he United States will remain a key driver for now, compensating for the sluggish recovery in many other advanced econo­ mies as well as China. While he Chinese economy falters, a gradual upswing is continuing in he euro area due o rising purchasing power and falling inflation. In 2024, he global economy is expected o grow by 3.7 percent, while i should grow by 3.6 percen and 3.7 percen in 2025 and 2026, respectively. 313 DIW Weekly Repor 50–52/2024 GLOBAL ECONOMY The sustained boom in he United States is once again determining he expansion",
    "empo of he global economy in 2024, compensating for he sluggish recovery in many other advanced economies and China. Thus, he gap in economic outpu between he United States and other importan econ­ omies such as he euro area is growing. Purchasing power has recovered in he euro area and he United Kingdom and is supporting a gradual upturn here. The Chinese economy is faltering, meaning i will no reach its growth arge of five percen for 2024. Lastly, he economic and rade policies of US President-elec Donald Trump are pu ing he global eco­ nomic order o he est. Global economic growth has picked up speed recently: The global economy expanded by 0.8 percen in he hird quar­ ter of 2024 after growth of 0.7 percen in he second quarter (Figure 1). In he fall, global growth in he advanced econ­ omies was primarily driven by a strong increase of 0.7 per­ cen in he United States. Mos other advanced economies are continuing o recover a a moderate pace; for example, the British and Japanese economies grew by only 0.1 and 0.2 percent, respectively. The euro area, in contrast, contin­ ued its recovery, recording an increase of 0.4 percent. Spain and he Netherlands grew he mos by 0.8 percen each, followed by France by 0.4 percent. In contrast, Italy and Germany stagnated. The economies of he Central and Southeastern EU coun­ tries suffered from weak demand from Germany. In hese countries, economic outpu declined by 0.2 percen in he third quarter of 2024. The only exception was Czechia, where GDP increased by 0.3 percent. Following a weak second quarter, he situation was some­ wha be er for emerging economies. The Chinese economy picked up speed and recorded growth of 0.9 percent. The pace of expansion of he Indian economy has also been stronger recently, and Mexico’s GDP increased by 1.1 percen in he third quarter. In contrast, growth of 0.9 percen in Brazil was weaker han in he previous quarter. Despite he expected geopolitical and rade policy cutbacks, the global economy should expand slightly in he fourth quar­ ter of 2024, in par hanks o China’s increasingly strong eco­ nomic growth. Mos advanced economies are losing momen­ tum slightly, and he leading indicators deteriorated in he fall months. The slump in global industrial production con­ tinues as well: The Purchasing Managers Indices for he United States and he euro area were ilted o he downside from May o September and recently moved sideways. The picture in he services sector appears o be mixed: While he United States experienced strong growth in November, he indices for he euro area fell below he expansion hreshold. In October, he Purchasing Manager’s Index for manufac­ turing in he United Kingdom dropped below 50, a rend tha continued into November. The index for Japanese man­ ufacturing is continuing its sideways movemen slightly below he expansion hreshold. In surveys, he newes polit­ ical developments, such as Trump’s re-election and he col­ lapse of he German",
    "governmen coalition, were only par­ tially reflected. However, hese events are likely o have led to increased uncertainty among firms and private house­ holds alike abou future economic policy frameworks. The bigges uncertainties concern he future rade policy of he United States. To hedge agains his, companies will likely pull orders forward, meaning ha exports o he United States should initially be somewha stronger han expected. However, his will presumably no be reflected in he aggre­ gated global economic output. We expec growth in he United States in he fourth quarter of 2024 will continue o be strong, albei somewha weaker than in he hird quarter, and supported by private consump­ tion in particular. The recovery in he euro area will lose some momentum for he ime being: For example, France is experiencing a weak fourth quarter following he one- off effects related o he Olympic Games. The Japanese and The rising shadow of protectionism is negatively affecting he global economy Figure 1 Growth of real GDP Quarter-on-quarter percentage growth (lef axis); Index 2015 Q1 = 100 (righ axis) Sources: National Statistical Offices; DIW Berlin Economic Outlook Winter 2024. © DIW Berlin 2024 Tightened rade barriers are likely o slow he global economy down somewhat. 314 DIW Weekly Repor 50–52/2024 GLOBAL ECONOMY South Korean economies, in contrast, are projected o gain some momentum again. In China, he outlook has improved due o he recently announced monetary and fiscal policy measures, which has brightened economic sentiment. We assume ha a less restrictive monetary policy will sup­ por economic growth in he coming years. The central banks of many advanced economies will likely cu interes rates further in 2025. The inflation rate continues o be lower in many places, which is mainly due o falling energy prices. Inflation in he services sector remains high in many places. Emerging economies have initiated an interes rate urna­ round earlier and may have reached he end of he inter­ es rate cuts. For example, inflation in Mexico is proving to be more persisten han expected, and he Central Bank of Brazil recently raised interes rates again in response to higher core inflation. In contrast, he People's Bank of China is following a loose monetary policy due o deflation­ ary endencies. Fiscal policy is slightly expansionary in mos economies. In the United Kingdom, he Labour governmen passed its fall budget, ushering in an expansionary fiscal policy. Fiscal pol­ icy in he United States is also likely o be expansionary over the forecas horizon due o many of President-elec Trump’s proposals. A he end of September, he Chinese governmen announced its larges stimulus package since he pandemic. Equaling around 1,300 billion euros, he package focuses on solving he deb problems of local governments. An excep­ tion o he expansionary fiscal policy is he euro area, where fiscal policy will likely remain slightly restrictive over he forecas period.

    "rade in he hird quarter. Assuming tha global rade barriers are ightened from 2025 onwards, international rade is likely o be stronger in he fourth quar­ ter of 2024, due o anticipated purchases . Therefore, overall growth of 1.2 percen is expected for 2024. Only a moderate upswing is expected for 2025 and 2026 due o likely ighter trade barriers. Furthermore, industry’s ongoing weak growth should continue o weigh on international rade before fall­ ing interes rates boos corporate investmen somewha a the end of 2025 and suppor international rade. In he coming years, he expected increase in rade barri­ ers is likely o slow global economic growth. This forecas assumes ha he US governmen will increase ariff rates on Chinese goods imports by 10 percentage points, resulting in an average rate on Chinese exports of around 30 percent. A the same ime, he forecas also assumes ha he aluminum and steel ariffs on he European Union, which had been sus­ pended by he Biden administration, will be reintroduced. In reaction o he increase in US ariffs, i is assumed ha the economies affected will ake argeted countermeasures, bu avoid an escalation. Due o ariff asymmetries, regions may be affected differently. Box 1 Assumptions and framework conditions Assumptions abou interes rates, exchange rates, and energy prices This forecas is based on he following assumptions abou he further developmen of key interes rates, exchange rates, and commodity prices (Table). These assumptions were made based on previous developments, futures markets prices, and he clos­ ing prices on he date of his forecas (November 12, 2024). The European Central Bank (ECB) decreased interes rates once again in October, hus continuing he path of normalization. For he win­ ter forecast, four further interes rate cuts of 25 basis points each are assumed for he deposi rate until spring 2025. The money marke interes rates also fell in line with key interes rates. We expec ha key interes rates will continue o fall until mid-2025 and hen remain a ha level. The ransmission of interes rate cuts into he real economy is also beginning o show. For example, he refinancing costs for households and firms began o decline in he second quarter of 2024, and his decline is likely o continue in line with key interes rates. The yield on governmen bonds increased again slightly in he fourth quarter of 2024. We assume ha cap­ ital marke interes rates will remain largely unchanged over he forecas horizon a 2.3 percen for Germany and 2.9 percen for he euro area. The euro has recently appreciated slightly agains he US dollar. For he forecas period, i is assumed ha he exchange rate of EUR o USD will remain a 1.07 USD per EUR, he level reached a he end of he data period. According o futures, he price for Bren oil should increase slightly in he coming months before declining again a he star of 2025 until he end of he forecas period. In 2024, he average",
    "price should be 81 USD per barrel before declining o an average of 73 USD per barrel in 2025 and finally o 71 USD per barrel in 2026. The wholesale price for gas (TTF) rose over he course of 2024 and should be 34 euros per megawa hour on average. Over he forecas horizon, we assume tha he prices will increase o 40 euros in 2025 before falling o 34 euros per megawa hour in 2026. Geopolitical and rade policy assumptions Additionally, he forecas assumes ha here will be no further es­ calation in he war in Ukraine. In he Middle East, an easing of en­ sions is becoming increasingly less likely. The fall of former Syrian Presiden Bashar al-Assad is causing uncertainty and could lead o higher oil and gas prices. In addition, his forecas assumes ha US President-elec Trump will implemen some of he rade ariffs he has announced. I is assumed ha he American governmen will increase ariff rates by 10 percentage points for all goods imported from China in he firs quarter of 2025. As a result, he average tariff rate on Chinese goods, which is currently around 20 percent, would increase again by half o around 30 percen (including automotive ariffs and 100-percen ariffs on e-cars). The ariffs on European Union aluminum and steel, which had been suspended, will be implemented again (10 percen for aluminum and 25 per­ cen for steel). Furthermore, rade partners will presumably forego broad countermeasures and only reac with retaliatory ariffs on specific groups of goods.

President-elec Donald Trump has made contradictory and sometimes extreme announcements abou ariff increases. I is likely ha Trump will continue he rade policy of his firs erm and ha he hrea of additional impor ariffs will primarily serve as a",
    "means of exerting pressure in bilateral negotiations, with ariffs likely o be implemented only partially. Concretely, his forecas assumes ha following Trump’s inaugu­ ration, ariffs on Chinese goods will increase by 10 percent1 and the ariffs on European Union aluminum and steel, which were suspended by he Biden administration (10 percen for aluminum and 25 percen for steel), will be reimplemented. Furthermore, he United States’ rade partners will presumably avoid broad counter­ measures and only reac with retaliatory ariffs on specific groups of goods. Although Trump announced further drastic measures such as universal impor ariffs of 10 or 20 percen during his election campaign, hese would have considerable economic and polit­ ical implications if implemented. On he one hand, ariffs of his magnitude would considerably increase he prices of imported goods and hus create strong inflation, potentially accompanied by supply chain disruptions and a supply shortage in he United States.2 This is likely o be me with considerable resistance from the public as well as from industry. For example, a study has shown tha high inflation rates considerably decrease approval of he reigning government.3 In addition, a sharp increase in impor ariffs could destabilize he stock markets, as indicated by he recen drop in shares of he car manufacturers General Motors and Ford following Trump’s announcements of ariffs on Mexican imports. Finally, here are legal hurdles which, despite he US President’s far-reaching powers, are likely o make an escalation in rade spol­ icy more difficult. If all ariffs actually are implemented, hey will cause significan real economic distortions Nevertheless, here is grea uncertainty regarding hese assump­ tions and i seems possible ha considerably comprehensive pro­ tectionis measures will be implemented. Drastic impor ariffs are no only justified as a means of obtaining concessions from rade partners, bu also as a means of generating public revenue as well 1 Cf. Vivek Mishra and Kevin Yao, “Trump o Unleash Nearly 40 Tariffs on China in Early 2025, Hi ing Growth: Reuters Poll,” Reuters, November 20, 2024 (available online). 2 Cf. Warwick J. McKibbin, Megan Hogan, and Marcus Noland, “International Economic Implica­ tions of a Second Trump Presidency,” Working Papers 24-20 (2024: Peterson Institute for Interna­ tional Economics) (available online). 3 Cf. David Steinberg, Daniel McDowell, and Erdem Aytac, “The Impac of Inflation on Suppor for Kamala Harris in he 2024 Presidential Election,” (2024) (available online). as maintaining domestic industry and related jobs. Although hese justifications are no empirically sound, hey could poin o he actual implementation of more far-reaching ariffs. For example, Trump has repeatedly announced universal impor tariffs of 10 percen and ariffs on Chinese imports of 60 percent. This would be a drastic break from previous American rade pol­ icy; for example, he average effective ariff rate in 2023 was only 3.8 percent. Such a massive ightening of rade policy would also have very negative economic consequences for he United States. For example, model calculations4 show ha implementing univer­ sal impor ariffs of 10 percen withou rade policy reactions would",
    "reduce US production by 0.4 percentage points by he end of he forecas horizon. In he year of he ariff increase, inflation would be 0.6 percentage points higher. The Federal Reserve would likely respond o his strong price pressure with a restrictive course, which would dampen domestic economic activity. In he long erm, comprehensive ariffs are also likely o weaken he competitiveness of he US economy due o higher production costs and he shifting of resources o less pro­ ductive sectors.5 The United States’ rade partners could respond with broad retaliatory ariffs, which could rigger a rade war and further destabilize international rade relations. Positive effects of the impor ariffs on he US economy will likely be limited. For ex­ ample, a study6 shows ha he ariffs during Trump’s firs erm did no create any jobs in ariffed sectors. On he contrary, he result­ ing counter ariffs imposed by China were economically costly for the United States7 and negatively affected employmen levels.8 A he same ime, he ariffs would no reduce he rade deficit,9 partly due o an expected appreciation of he US dollar, which makes exports more expensive and imports cheaper. The global economy would also be hi hard by such a comprehen­ sive increase in US ariffs. For example, exports will decline and production will fall in he res of he world, while a he same ime goods imported from he United States will become more expen­ sive due o a likely appreciation of he US dollar. The negative con­ sequences for individual countries will likely depend on he ariff amoun and he country’s dependency on he United States as a trade partner.

I is clear ha he share of all exports o he United States of otal exports is rather low for large EU Member States. The economic consequences of he ariffs may hus be rather limited overall, bu there are significan regional differences. A study10 investigated possible consequences of a universal",
    "impor ariff of 10 percent, 60 percen on Chinese imports, and 100 percen on all imported cars. According o he model calculations in he study, he EU’s GDP is expected o decline by around 0.11 percent.11 Germany’s economy, in contrast, would be hi even harder; impos­ ing impor ariffs on cars would severely affec German industry.12 In addition, he United States is he mos importan individual sales marke for German pharmaceutical companies. If US gas exports o he EU are used as a means of political pressure, there is also he risk ha energy prices will rise again. This would likely further burden he beleaguered manufacturing industry in Germany in particular. However, Germany could benefi from ariff asymmetries and rade diversification, which may somewha com­ pensate for he negative effects; an escalation of he rade conflic between he United States and China ha entails significantly higher ariffs on both rade partners would make German products relatively more affordable. A he same ime, he ariff policy may lead o more diversification of rade relationships with other coun­ tries,13 which could further increase demand for German products. With a share of around 15 percen of otal expor volume in 2023, the United States is China’s mos importan rade partner. An in­ crease in ariffs on all imported Chinese goods o 60 percen would hi he Chinese economy hard and lead o distortions in interna­ tional rade. A he same ime, China may, as in 2018, ake counter­ measures, which would likely strengthen he effect. During he firs Trump administration, he counter ariffs were around he amoun of he American ariffs, which avoided an escalation. Tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods could resul in significan economic losses for both countries. In Canada, he crude oil sec­ tor14 would be affected, while in Mexcio, he automobile industry, the country's mos importan industrial sector, would be affected in particular. 10 Cf.

For emerging economies, he expected appreciation of he US dol­ lar due o he sharp increase in impor ariffs would be associated with considerable disadvantages, as heir debts are denominated in dollars.

While a pro­ tectionis rade policy and restrictive immigration policy will lead o price pressure, falling energy prices will likely dampen this pressure in he forecas period. Continued strong con­ sumption should contribute o growth, supported by house­ holds’ good financial situation, a solid labor market, and planned ax relief for private households under he new gov­ ernment. Corporate investments will likely suppor growth as well, driven by be er financing conditions, he recovery of he real estate sector, and an expected decrease in he cor­ porate income ax. The euro area economy should expand further in 2025 and 2026 due o strong domestic demand as a resul of rising real wages (Figure 2). The effects of US ariffs as assumed in his forecas should only marginally hamper growth. While he United States is an importan rade partner for European economies, its marke share for exports from he large EU Member States is in he single digits on average and here­ fore relatively small compared o ha of he Member States’ trade partners within he EU (Box 2). The outlook for he emerging economies remains favora­ ble, bu he new US governmen is likely o increase rade policy uncertainty. In addition o China, Mexico may be he country mos affected by impor ariffs. In China, he mos recen stimulus package is generating growth, although he American impor ariffs on Chinese products will weigh heavily on goods exports. In 2024, advanced economies are projected o expand by 1.8 percen and emerging economies by 4.7 percent. A growth rate of 3.7 percen is expected for he global economy in 2024, while growth of 3.6 and 3.7 percen is expected for 2025 and 2026, respectively. The forecas for 2025 has been adjusted downward by 0.1 percentage points. This moderate down­ ward correction results from he fac ha he assumed rade barriers are offse by more dynamic growth in he United States (Table 1). Downward risks for he global economy have increased con­ siderably since he fall. Geopolitical risks remain quite high. Further escalation in he Middle Eas could increase oil and gas prices even more. The war in Ukraine remains incalcu­ lable, especially following Trump’s re-election, which has increased economic and security policy risks overall.",
    "This forecas makes assumptions abou future US rade and fiscal policy after Trump’s inauguration in January 2025 (Box 1). However, if here are considerably higher rade bar­ riers han assumed in his forecast, here are likely o be greater global economic fallouts (Box 2). A further risk fac­ tor is public deb sustainability. In France, governmen bond yields have risen, as he resignation of French Prime Minister Michel Barnier has increased doubts abou a reduction in the deb burden. 319 DIW Weekly Repor 50–52/2024 GERMAN ECONOMY The German economy continues o experience weak growth. In addition o he ongoing global industrial slump, he eco­ nomic structural change in Germany is having a noticeable impact: Structural adaptation in he manufacturing indus­ try, for example o stronger international competition, has now reached industry-related sectors such as business-re­ lated services and are affecting he labor market. Companies in industry as well as hose in industry-related sectors are responding o he lack of orders no only by expanding short- time work, bu also by laying off some of heir staff despite the ongoing skilled worker shortage. Accordingly, unem­ ploymen has increased again recently. While economic out­ pu increased slightly (by 0.1 percent) in he hird quarter of 2024, his growth was preceded by a strong decline (by 0.3 percent) in he second quarter (Figure 2). Exports and investments in particular have declined again, likely also due o structural reasons. Persistently weak for­ eign demand for local manufacturing products was also evi­ den in he hird quarter: Exports dropped significantly, goods exports experienced a considerable slump. This in combina­ tion with slightly positive imports resulted in a negative rade balance. Thus, foreign rade depressed economic growth in Germany. Investments in equipmen and construction were also on he decline again. Nonetheless, GDP increased slightly in he hird quarter, which can be a ributed o a moderate expansion of private consumption on he one hand. However, as his growth fol­ lowed a steep decline in he previous quarter, his canno be considered a recovery. Taking into accoun stable inflation rates and sustained wage increases, which were once again strong in he hird quarter, he expansion of private con­ sumption seems rather restrained. In ligh of he impending layoffs a major industrial companies, many private house­ holds are likely o be more concerned abou heir own jobs. I seems ha hey are saving more money again ou of cau­ tion: The savings rate increased for he fourth quarter in a row. On he other hand, inventories were expanded signif­ icantly and supported economic development: Companies produced more han was consumed, resulting in GDP being higher han he sum of its components. Examining individual economic sectors makes i clear ha the crisis in German industry is worsening and noticeably impacting other sectors. The gross value added of manu­ facturing as well as he construction sector have recently declined. I declined by 1.4 percen for manufacturing, con­ siderably more han expected in he fall. The gross value added of some",
    "services, such as professional services firms, financial services and insurance providers, and information and communication services, declined. Strong growth in public services and other service providers are keeping over­ all gross value added from dipping into he red. The re-election of Donald Trump and he collapse of he German governmen coalition a he beginning of November created further uncertainty abou he economic policy frame­ work of he coming years, especially among companies. The outlook for foreign rade has worsened, as he Trump admin­ istration will likely increase rade barriers significantly start­ ing in 2025. This forecas assumes ha after Trump akes office, he will reimpose 10-percen ariffs on steel and 25-per­ cen ariffs on aluminum ha had previously been repealed by curren US Presiden Joe Biden. Moreover, i assumes ha the ariff rate for Chinese exports o he United States will increase by 10 percentage points. The average ariff rate on goods imports from China o he United States will likely be 30 percen instead of around 20 percen (Box 1). Domestically, here is still no federal budge for 2025 due o the collapse of he governmen coalition and he snap elec­ tion. Provisional budge managemen applies following he collapse, under which expenditure may only be incurred Figure 2 Growth of real GDP in Germany In billions of euros (lef axis) and quarter-on-quarter in percen (righ axis) Note: Forecas from he fourth quarter of 2024; adjusted for price, seasonal, and calendar effects.

German economy still struggling o make headway 320 DIW Weekly Repor 50–52/2024 GERMAN ECONOMY The increased uncertainty is hi ing he German economy in an already extremely difficul situation between cyclical weakness and structural change. Thus, another decline in economic outpu is expected in he curren fourth quarter (Table 2). Leading indicators from he beginning of he cur­ ren quarter, i.e., before he US presidential election and he collapse of he German governmen coalition caused addi­ tional uncertainty, sugges ha he industrial slump would have continued regardless of he additional negative factors and ha a recovery would have been delayed again. The Global Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index remained below he expansion hreshold of 50 index points in October. In November, he index declined again. While he index for industry stagnated below he expansion hreshold of 50, he index for services fell below his hreshold for he firs ime since February. I should be noted ha only some of he sur­ veys ook place following Trump’s re-election and he col­ lapse of he German governmen coalition. The exten o which hese political developments have further depressed sentimen will probably only become fully apparen in he December survey. Meanwhile, he order situation remains weak for both services as well as manufacturing. For exam­ ple, gross value added in he curren fourth quarter is likely to decline slightly overall, ye sligh increases in he ser­ vice",
    "sectors will compensate for further declines in indus­ trial production. The uncertainties due o foreign and domestic political devel­ opments should resul in companies acting more reserved in to “maintain existing institutions, legal obligations of he federal government,”1 and for measures ha have already been adopted. In addition, some fiscal policy suppor ha had already passed he Federal Cabine bu had no ye been approved by he Bundestag will no longer find a major­ ity under he curren minority government. This suppor includes measures aimed a stimulating investment, such as he extension of degressive depreciation rules, which were introduced as par of he growth initiative announced in late summer. Planned adjustments o he income ax rate o eliminate bracke creep and he increase in he child allow­ ance and child benefi are also unlikely o happen for he time being. This forecas assumes ha a governmen will be formed and a budge resolution agreed upon in early sum­ mer 2025, which will suppor he financial situation of he federal ministries and agencies and hus governmen con­ sumption. However, as new governmen plans and fiscal pol­ icy measures canno ye be known, fiscal policy will remain restrictive for he ime being. Due o uncertainties abou a new government’s economic policy orientation, companies located in Germany in particular are likely o ac carefully. Thus, investmen decisions are likely o be delayed o 2025. 1 The legal basis for provisional budge managemen is Article 111 of he Basic Law. The erm “institutions” includes constitutional bodies, federal agencies, institutions, and construction facil­ ities, for example. Maintaining existing institutions includes ongoing personnel costs, costs relat­ ed o filling new positions, and replacemen equipmen costs. “Legal obligations” include, among other hings, benefi claims from Social Code II (SGB II) such as he citizen’s benefi (Bürgergeld), housing allowance (Wohngeld), parental allowance (Elterngeld), and expenditure obligations from international agreements.

The deteriorating external eco­ nomic environmen is also having an dampening impac on foreign rade as well as he willingness o invest. On he flip side, exports o he United States are expected o be pulled forward o he curren and upcoming quarters, as he risk of steep ariff increases goes well beyond he reintroduction of aluminum and steel ariffs assumed in his forecast. The temporary rise in exports should in urn boos imports of intermediary goods. Overall, foreign rade is expected o once again make a negative contribution o GDP in his quarter. Private consumption should continue o develop weakly, barely supporting economic developmen in he fourth quar­ ter. Job worries in particular are dampening private house­ holds’ willingness o spend. This is reflected in he savings rate, which has been rising for four quarters. In addition, the price level, which has become permanently higher, is slowing consumption despite rising real disposable income. Construction investments in which residential construction largely driven by private households plays a key role are likely to decline again. We expec ha he economic situation will relax very gradu­ ally over he further course of he forecast. From mid-2025, with a new federal governmen and clearer external economic conditions, more and more uncertainties will dissipate and make households and companies more confiden again. The stabilization of employmen over he course of 2025, which should even grow somewha in 2026 should also contribute to his. Accordingly, unemploymen will gradually decline. As a result, we expec ha more of he higher disposable incomes and a leas some of he household savings will",
    "be spen again. Construction and equipmen investments should hen stabilize, with he la er likely also being sup­ ported by governmen expenditure in 2025 in particular as a par of he Bundeswehr’s special fund. Companies will likely increasingly inves in heir production capacities beginning in 2026. As European industry increasingly recovers, foreign demand will rise and he European Central Bank (ECB), as assumed, will cu interes rates further and German exports will likely pick up speed again. While monetary policy will become increasingly less restric­ tive due o further interes rate cuts over he course of he forecas period, fiscal policy will likely remain restrictive. On the one hand, his is due o he expiry of expansionary meas­ ures in response o he energy crisis, he end of ax breaks, and ax increases. On he other hand, we assume ha he col­ lapse of he coalition will mean ha revenue-reducing legis­ lation will no longer be implemented, hus decreasing expan­ sionary stimuli. Due o he snap elections for he German Bundestag, he overall direction of fiscal policy during he forecas period is subjec o a high degree of uncertainty. All in all, price-adjusted GDP will likely contrac by 0.2 per­ cen in 2024 for he second year in a row (Table 3). In 2025, global economic outpu should expand by 0.2 percent, con­ siderably less han was expected in he fall. Growth will be stronger in 2026 a 1.2 percent. However, his will be in par due o non-recurring effects such as a comparatively high number of work days. Thus, DIW Berlin is lowering its fore­ cas for 2024 by 0.5 percentage points and for 2025 and 2026 by 0.7 and 0.2 percentage points, respectively. The signifi­ can downward revision in some cases is primarily due o he enormous additional burdens on he German economy due to he many uncertainties, both for companies as well as pri­ vate households. With his forecast, DIW Berlin is revising potential GDP downward again. In 2029, potential growth of he German economy should still be 0.3 percent. Overall, the outpu gap for 2024 and 2025 is likely o be a bi larger than expected in fall. The gap will be −1.0 percen for 2024 and −0.9 percen for 2025. Over he course of he recovery, the gap is expected o nearly close a −0.2 percen in 2026. Following he strong growth of previous years, average con­ sumer price inflation should be 2.2 percent, primarily due to falling energy prices. This is close o he ECB’s wo-per­ cen arge In he coming years, he inflation rate is expected to level off a wo percent. Thus, DIW Berlin’s inflation fore­ cas remains unchanged compared o he fall. The core rate (inflation excluding energy and food) should also decline fur­ ther and come closer o he inflation arget, bu more slowly than he overall rate of inflation. The downside risks for he German economy grew signifi­ cantly larger in he fall. In particular, domestic and foreign economic",
    "policy uncertainties pose a risk of real economic distortions ha could be significantly greater han assumed in his forecast.
