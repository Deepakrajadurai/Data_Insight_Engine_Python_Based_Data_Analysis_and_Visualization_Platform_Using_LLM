Despite a nominal increase of six percent \n\nin construction expenses in 2023, it decreased by just over \n\none percent in inflation-adjusted terms. In 2024, the nominal \n\nconstruction volume is likely to contract by around 3.5 per­\n\ncent, declining for the first time since the financial crisis due to \n\nfalling construction prices. Residential construction in particu­\n\nlar experienced a sharp decline in 2023 and will continue on \n\nthis downward trend more strongly in 2024. Renovation and \n\nmodernization activity is less affected than new construction. \n\nThe situation will stabilize by 2025. The prospect of con­\n\nstructing 400,000 new residences annually is thus becoming \n\nincreasingly out of reach. Only civil engineering is stabilizing \n\nthe construction industry overall; it is likely to expand in both \n\n2024 and 2025. The different growth prospects of the sectors \n\nrequire restructuring in the construction industry. In particu­\n\nlar, capacities freed up in new residential construction should \n\nbe utilized in the energy-efficient renovation of private and \n\npublic buildings. Policy makers should actively support this \n\nrestructuring. In addition, they should provide clarity about the \n\nsubsidy programs for energy-efficient building renovation and \n\nresidential unit construction. At the same time, it is important \n\nto maintain focus on the new housing construction target.\n\nThe construction industry in Germany continues to strug­\n\ngle. The crisis began in 2021 with material and supply bot­\n\ntlenecks and continued in 2022 and 2023 with the energy \n\ncrisis and loss of household purchasing power due to con­\n\nsumer price inflation. This was compounded by rapidly ris­\n\ning interest rates, which made it considerably more diffi­\n\ncult to finance construction projects, particularly for private \n\nhouseholds, but also for companies. In particular, incoming \n\norders and building permits for new residential construc­\n\ntion plummeted last year. Due to the very dynamic devel­\n\nopment of construction prices, the construction volume in \n\nnominal terms increased over the years, but price-adjusted \n\ndeclines have already been recorded in almost all construc­\n\ntion sectors since 2021.\n\nNominal construction volume is expected to contract in 2024. \n\nDue to declining capacity utilization and falling material \n\nprices, prices are likely to fall as well and a turnaround in \n\ninterest rates is expected in summer 2024. However, as prices \n\nand interest rates are likely to remain high overall and many \n\nsubsidy programs are in limbo, the building construction \n\nvolume in particular is likely to suffer and in some cases \n\ndecline considerably. Development is likely to improve in \n\n2025, but strong growth is not expected.\n\nThese are the results of DIW Berlin’s calculations of the con­\n\nstruction volume,1 which includes construction investments \n\nas well as repairs that do not increase value. Furthermore, in \n\naddition to construction in the narrower sense, the calcula­\n\ntions encompass related sectors, such as steel and light metal \n\nconstruction, the manufacture of prefabricated buildings, \n\nbuilding fittings, planning, and other services. As a supple­\n\nment to the investment calculation of the Statistical Offices, \n\nDIW Berlin’s annual construction volume differentiates \n\n1 \n\nThe construction volume calculation is financed with funds from the Zukunft Bau research in­\n\nitiative of the Federal Ministry for Housing, Urban Development and Building (Bundesministerium \n\nfür Wohnen, Stadtentwicklung und Bauwesen, BMWSB). Cf. the most recent construction volume \n\ncalculation: Martin Gornig and Laura Pagenhardt, \"Construction Boom Coming to an End; Change \n\nin Policy Strategy Needed,\" DIW Weekly Report, no. 1+2 (2023) (available online; accessed on \n\n December 18, 2023. This applies to all other online sources in this report unless stated otherwise).\n\n5\n\nDIW Weekly Report 1+2/2024\n\nCONSTRUCTION VOLUME CALCULATION\n\nbetween new housing construction activity and housing \n\nstock modernization.2\n\n2 Martin Gornig and Hanna Révész, “Strukturdaten zur Produktion und Beschäftigung im \n\nBaugewerbe – Berechnungen für das Jahr 2022,” BBSR Online Publikation, no. 53 (2023) (in \n\n German; available online).\n\nDIW Berlin not only calculates and documents the construc­\n\ntion volume of past years; it also forecasts corresponding val­\n\nues for the current (2024) and upcoming years (2025). This \n\nforecast (Box) is integrated into DIW Berlin’s Economic \n\nOutlook, particularly with regard to investment activity. In \n\naddition to the present estimates regarding the development \n\nof construction investment, the construction volume calcu­\n\nlation includes forecasts on the growth of new and existing \n\nhousing volumes in the building construction, residential, \n\nand non-residential sectors.3 Moreover, these figures are \n\nused to derive the development trends of the core construc­\n\ntion industry and the renovation sector.\n\nResidential construction situation worsening\n\nThe past three years have been difficult for the residential \n\nconstruction sector. The enormous price increases—which \n\nbegan in 2021 due to supply bottlenecks and material short­\n\nages before then being exacerbated by the energy crisis in \n\n2022—were compounded by the ECB’s key interest rate \n\nhikes, which had an impact on mortgage rates within a very \n\nshort period of time: Between the end of 2021 and autumn \n\n2023, interest rates rose from 1.3 to over four percent. In \n\n2024, they are now as high as they were last in 2011 (Figure 1). \n\nFinancing conditions are currently almost impossible to \n\nmeet, especially for private households, resulting in projects \n\nbeing reduced, canceled, or not initiated at all. This is also \n\nreflected in new orders, which have been trending downward \n\nsince early 2022 and have only recently stabilized (Figure 2). \n\n3 Cf. Claus Michelsen and Martin Gornig, “Prognose der Bestandsmaßnahmen und Neubau­\n\nleistungen im Wohnungsbau und im Nichtwohnungsbau,” BBSR-Online-Publikation, no. 7 (2016) \n\n(in German; available online).\n\nFigure 1\n\nInterest rates and yields\n\nIn percent, monthly average\n\n \n\nSource: Deutsche Bundesbank.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nInterest rates and yields have returned to the 2011 level.\n\nBox\n\nMethod for forecasting construction volume\n\nIndicator-based statistical models are used to forecast the \n\nconstruction volume. The forecasting variable, for example \n\nresidential construction volume, is regressed on an autore­\n\ngressive term and on concurrent as well as lagged values of \n\nthe respective indicator, for example new orders. The con­\n\nstruction volumes of new and existing buildings are estimated \n\nseparately.\n\nThe forecast equation is as follows:\n\n \n\nyt stands for the value to be forecast, xt for the indicator, and \n\nεt for the statistical error term. α, βi, and γj are the estimated \n\n parameters. The numbers of lags n and m (years) are deter­\n\nmined based on the autocorrelation or cross-correlation func­\n\ntion. The approach of estimating a large number of individual \n\nmodels and using average values for the forecast has proved \n\neffective. For an individual series, up to 1,500 single models \n\nare estimated. Construction permits, new orders and the order \n\nbacklog, production, interest, loan volumes, employment and \n\nincome trends, and surveys of construction companies and \n\nfreelance architects have proven to be suitable indicators.1\n\nUsing this approach, a forecast with a prediction capability \n\nof up to two years can be made for all aggregates. It should \n\nbe noted, however, that the number of point estimates used \n\nfor averaging decreases significantly as the forecast range \n\nincreases due to the different prediction capabilities of the \n\nindividual indicators. To provide the forecast with additional \n\nstability, expectations for employment and GDP for 2023 to \n\n2025 are therefore also included in the models as concurrent \n\nindicators. Expected civil engineering volume is equal to the \n\ndifference between total volume and construction volume.\n\nThe construction volume forecast for the previous year (2023) \n\nis also calculated using this method (nowcast). The indicators \n\nare updated using statistical methods to obtain values for \n\n2023. All model results are rationalized using the construction \n\ninvestment forecast. Assumptions about the development of \n\nconstruction prices are based on the DIW Berlin economic \n\nforecast for winter 2023 and the authors’ calculations. Price \n\nforecasts are adjusted for each sectors.\n\n1 \n\nMichelsen and Gornig, “Prognose der Bestandsmaßnahmen und Neubauleistungen im \n\nWohnungsbau und im Nichtwohnungsbau.”\n\n6\n\nDIW Weekly Report 1+2/2024\n\nCONSTRUCTION VOLUME CALCULATION\n\nAccording to the ifo Institute, nearly half of residential con­\n\nstruction companies have complained about a lack of orders, \n\nwhile a fifth of them are dealing with order cancelations.4 For \n\nexample, the number of existing orders have shrunk consid­\n\nerably since the peak in spring 2022 (Figure 3). According \n\nto an autumn 2023 survey conducted by the Zentralverband \n\ndes Deutschen Baugewerbes (ZDB), 70 percent of construction \n\ncompanies expect the business situation to worsen.5\n\nThe outlook for 2024 is not much better. Although the price \n\nmomentum significantly slowed down over 2023, it remains \n\nhigh. In addition to this, there is the general loss of house­\n\nhold purchasing power due to the sharp rise in consumer \n\nprices, which wage development has so far been unable to \n\n4 ifo Institute, “Düstere Perspektiven für den Wohnungsbau,” press release from December 11, \n\n2023 (in German; available online).\n\n5 Zentralverband des Deutschen Baugewerbes, \"Baukonjunktur 2023/2024: Zwischen Fach­\n\nkräftemangel und Kurzarbeit,\" press release from December 6, 2023 (in German; available online).\n\ncompensate for. The uncertainty about the future develop­\n\nment of income and the overall economic output is likely to \n\nfurther dampen housing investments. The continuing high \n\ndemand for (affordable) living space, especially in urban \n\ncenters, does little to change this. For example, accord­\n\ning to studies from the Hans Böckler Foundation and its \n\nMacroeconomic Policy Institute (IMK), potentially millions \n\nof additional units of social housing are still needed in large \n\nGerman cities.6\n\nFollowing three years of enormous increases, construction \n\nprices are expected to decline in 2024: Due to dwindling \n\ndemand, capacity utilization in building construction has \n\nmarkedly declined to below the 70 percent threshold at the \n\nend of 2023 (Figure 4). Together with falling material prices, \n\nthis reduces price pressures.

Accordingly, the noticeable wage increases that are \n\nexpected following the collective wage negotiations are likely \n\nto come at the expense of corporate profits.\n\nMeanwhile, a turnaround in interest rates is expected in \n\nearly summer 2024, when market participants foresee the \n\nfirst ECB interest rate cuts.7 Financing conditions are there­\n\nfore likely to ease somewhat this year. The declines in prices, \n\n7 Timm Bönke et al., “DIW Berlin Economic Forecast: Forecast ranges from cloudy to bright,” \n\nDIW Weekly Report, no. 50+51+52 (2023): 305–313 (available online).\n\nhowever, will likely be unable to completely compensate for \n\nthe continued high interest rate.\n\nOverall, the nominal residential construction volume in \n\n2023 likely increased by 5.5 percent (Table 1). Construction \n\nprice inflation is likely to have completely swallowed up \n\nthis increase, resulting in a real decline of 2.3 percent. In \n\n2024, the residential construction volume is expected to sig­\n\nnificantly decrease despite falling prices in both nominal \n\n(minus 5.4 percent) and real (minus 3.4 percent) terms. A \n\nfurther nominal decline of 0.4 percent is expected for 2025 \n\n(Figure 5). As prices are expected to sink further, there is \n\nreal growth of 0.4 percent.\n\nResidential unit construction sector in a slump\n\nThe problems in residential construction are particularly \n\naffecting new construction. There, difficult financing condi­\n\ntions are likely playing the decisive role, making it impossi­\n\nble for a large share of households to start new construction \n\nplans. Building permits have plummeted since the begin­\n\nning of 2022: In autumn 2023, they were almost 40 percent \n\nbelow the peak values in 2021 and 2022 (Figure 6). In addi­\n\ntion, a large number of approved projects have not started \n\nbecause financing is no longer viable in many places. This is \n\nlikely to have a significant impact in new construction activ­\n\nity in the coming years if existing orders are increasingly pro­\n\ncessed and fewer and fewer new projects are initiated. For \n\nexample, the Verband der Wohnungswirtschaft Deutschland \n\n(GdW) is already reporting that many housing companies \n\nFigure 3\n\nStock of orders in the main construction industry\n\nIndex 2015 = 100, current prices, trend component\n\n \n\nSource: Deutsche Bundesbank.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nThe stock of orders in residential construction is trending upward.\n\nFigure 4\n\nCapacity utilization in the construction sector\n\nAs a percentage of normal seasonal machine utilization\n\n \n\nSource: ifo Institute.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nIn 2023, a lot of capacity in building construction remained unused.\n\n8\n\nDIW Weekly Report 1+2/2024\n\nCONSTRUCTION VOLUME CALCULATION\n\n2023, as the program’s funds had been exhausted. Although \n\napplications that had already been approved have been \n\nsecured and applications should be possible again at the \n\nbeginning of 2024, this is likely to discourage private house­\n\nholds from investing in new construction and further reduce \n\nnew construction activity.\n\nThe more difficult financing conditions have so far hardly \n\nbeen offset by the special tax deduction for the construction \n\nof new rental units, which was reactivated in January 2023. \n\nare having to cancel some of their projects or are currently \n\nunable to build any housing at all.8\n\nIn a surprising move, the Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau \n\n(KfW) stopped applications for its Klimafreundlicher Neubau \n\n(climate-friendly new builds) subsidy program in December \n\n8 Wohnungswirtschaft Deutschland (GdW), “Wohnungsbau im freien Fall – Regierung muss jetzt \n\nSchluss machen mit ‘aber’ und ‘wird schon’,” press release from November 29, 2023 (in German;

Furthermore, at the same time, \n\nthe linear depreciation rate was increased from two to three \n\npercent. Since October 2023, these conditions have been sup­\n\nplemented by the additional possibility of degressive depre­\n\nciation of six percent, which is also permittable for build­\n\nings of the lower efficiency class EH55.9 With falling inter­\n\nest rates and prices, these measures are likely to have more \n\n9 Cf. the measures of the Federal Government for additional investments in the construction of \n\naffordable and climate­friendly residences and for economic stabilization of the construction and \n\nreal estate industries on the website of the Federal Ministry for Housing, Urban Development and \n\nBuilding (Bundesministerium für Wohnen, Stadtentwicklung und Bauwesen, BMWSB) (in German; \n\navailable online).\n\nof an effect from the second half of 2024 and will stimulate \n\nnew construction activity.\n\nNevertheless, nominal residential construction is expected \n\nto decline by 8.4 percent in 2024 and to not recover in 2025 \n\n(minus 0.6 percent). In price-adjusted terms, there is a \n\ndecline of 6.5 percent in 2024 as well as slight growth of \n\n0.2 percent in 2025.\n\nWork on existing buildings continues to have a \n\nstabilizing effect\n\nThe robust development in renovation measures is likely to \n\nhave supported housing construction activity in 2023. While \n\nsome expansion and renovation projects have likely been \n\ncut back or even canceled completely due to higher costs—\n\nsuch projects can be adjusted more quickly and easily than \n\nnew construction projects—at the same time the decline in \n\nnew construction is likely to make more builders available \n\nfor renovation and modernization projects, which in turn \n\nwill make these projects more feasible.\n\nAt the same time, renovation and modernization is likely \n\nto be significantly less affected by rising financing costs: \n\nCompared to new residential construction, modernization \n\nand maintenance measures are much smaller in scale, mean­\n\ning that households often have sufficient capital to finance \n\nthe costs.10 Only the higher incentive for households to save \n\ncapital must be considered here. However, saving is only \n\nworthwhile to a limited extent: The credit interest rates for \n\nlonger-term investments are currently only half as high as \n\nthe mortgage rate for ten-year loans.\n\nThe fact that households are increasingly switching to reno­\n\nvation and modernization measures is also reflected in the \n\ncosts for approved construction projects: At the start of 2022, \n\nthe costs for new construction and for work on existing build­\n\nings were still at similar levels. While permit figures and \n\nnew construction costs have almost halved, the figures for \n\nrenovation have remained at near constant levels (Figure 7).\n\nMeasures to increase energy efficiency are likely to con­\n\ntinue to play a central role: Energy prices, despite the \n\ndeclines in recent years, remain high and are expected to \n\nrise again somewhat as a result of the Federal Government \n\ninitiating an additional increase in the carbon price in the \n\nNachtragshaushaltsgesetz 2021 in reaction to the recent Federal \n\nConstitutional Court ruling.11 This increases the incentives \n\nto invest in energy-related renovations.\n\n10 Christian Blanke and Katrin Klarhöfer, “Bestandsinvestitionen 2020: Struktur der Investitions­\n\ntätigkeit in den Wohnungs­ und Nichtwohnungsbeständen,” BBSR Online Publikation, no. 39 (2022) \n\n(in German; available online).\n\n11 In November 2023, the Federal Constitutional Court ruled against the German government, \n\nprohibiting the reallocation of 60 billion euros borrowed under emergency legislation during the \n\nCOVID­19 pandemic towards the Climate and Transformation Fund. In order to mitigate the effects \n\nof the ruling, amongst other measures, the government decided to increase the price of carbon \n\ndioxide further than had been initially planned: Instead of the planned 40 euros per ton, CO2 costs \n\n45 euros per ton in, 2024. In 2023, CO2 cost 30 euros per ton.\n\nFigure 6\n\nBuilding permits in building construction in Germany\n\nCurrent prices in billion euros, trend component\n\n \n\nSource: Federal Statistical Office.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nThe total number of approved construction projects markedly declined in 2023, \n\nbut is recovering in the public and commercial sectors.\n\n11\n\nDIW Weekly Report 1+2/2024\n\nCONSTRUCTION VOLUME CALCULATION\n\nHowever, public funding for energy-efficient refurbishment \n\nmeasures is still unclear. For example, around 19 billion \n\neuros were planned for funding energy-efficient renovations \n\nin the building sector in the Klima- und Transformationsfonds \n\n(Climate and Transformation Fund, KTF) in 2024. While the \n\nFederal Government promised this funding immediately \n\nafter the Federal Constitutional Court’s ruling, the applica­\n\ntion process at KfW is still on hold. Thus, the development of \n\nrenovation work may also be slowed down or at least delayed.\n\nOverall, renovation works are expected to decline by 4.1 per­\n\ncent this year, considerably less than new construction work. \n\nFor 2025, a further slight decline of 0.3 percent is expected. \n\nPrice-adjusted, this results in minus 2.2 percent in 2024 and \n\nin 0.5 percent in 2025.\n\nMore robust development in non-residential \n\nconstruction than in residential construction\n\nNon-residential construction was more stable than residen­\n\ntial construction in 2023. The worsened financing conditions \n\nare likely to have affected companies less than households. \n\nWhile new orders for both public and commercial building \n\nconstruction declined somewhat in 2023, they are currently \n\nincreasing again due to multiple major projects (Figure 2). \n\nThus, existing orders remain at a record level (Figure 3).\n\nNevertheless, weak overall economic development and high \n\ninterest rates are dampening the outlook for commercial con­\n\nstruction. The global economy has developed less dynam­\n\nically recently; in 2023, German exports declined notice­\n\nably. The development of the German economy over the \n\ncourse of the year remains uncertain, partly due to the Federal \n\nConstitutional Court ruling and despite the planned miti­\n\ngating measures, dampening both exports and investments \n\nin 2024.12 This is likely to keep companies from investing in \n\ncapacity expansion, for example by constructing new work­\n\nshops or warehouses.\n\nIn 2023, nominal non-residential construction increased by \n\n5.1 percent. In price-adjusted terms, however, it declined by \n\n0.9 percent. This development is expected to reverse in 2024: \n\nA nominal minus three percent is expected, which, due to \n\nfalling prices, ends up as a real minus of nearly one percent. \n\nIn 2025, non-residential construction volume is expected \n\nto expand by 1.2 percent nominally and by 2.5 percent in \n\nprice-adjusted terms (Table 2).\n\nPublic construction projects supporting new \n\nconstruction of non-residential buildings\n\nThe demand for new commercial buildings has slowed due \n\nto weak economic development, which makes investments \n\nin new corporate buildings seem imprudent. Moreover, the \n\npossibility to work from home, which has become more prev­\n\nalent since the coronavirus pandemic, is dampening the need \n\n12 Bönke et al., “DIW Berlin Economic Forecast.”\n\nfor office buildings. In 2022 (the most recent available sta­\n\ntistics), nearly a quarter of all employees partially worked at \n\nhome. This share is likely to not have declined significantly \n\nin 2023. Thus, the number of building permits for office and \n\nadministrative buildings has also continually declined since \n\n2020 (Figure 6). No stimuli are expected here.\n\nLarge projects are now stabilizing the order situation in the \n\npublic construction sector; existing orders have increased \n\nconsiderably (Figure 3). Funds that have been created in \n\nrecent years should now gradually be converted into project \n\nbudgets. Falling construction prices facilitate this develop­\n\nment. Thus, positive stimuli from public construction are \n\nexpected in both 2024 and 2025.\n\nOverall, new construction activity in non-residential build­\n\nings is likely to decrease by 4.2 percent nominally in 2024 \n\nbefore expanding by 1.4 percent in 2025. Price-adjusted, \n\nFigure 7\n\nNumber of permits granted for new construction projects\n\nIndex, Monthly average in 2021 = 100\n\n \n\nSource: Federal Statistical Office.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nThe number of construction permits for existing buildings is markedly higher than the \n\nfigure for new buildings.\n\n12\n\nDIW Weekly Report 1+2/2024\n\nCONSTRUCTION VOLUME CALCULATION\n\nalso still a large investment gap, particularly in the pub­\n\nlic sector: Planned and realized investments have gradually \n\nincreased in nominal terms in recent years, with an empha­\n\nsis on investments in school buildings and other childcare \n\nfacilities. Overall, however, the projects realized remained \n\nwell below the planned budget.13 Here, there is still much \n\npotential to expand construction work.\n\nWork on existing non-residential buildings is likely to decline \n\nby two percent nominally in 2024 before increasing by a good \n\none percent in 2025. Due to the falling prices, the price-ad­\n\njusted growth is 0.1 percent for 2024 and 2.4 percent for 2025.\n\nOnly civil engineering to increase in 2024\n\nThe activity in the civil engineering sector stabilized the \n\nconstruction volume in 2023. While construction output in \n\nbuilding construction was on the decline, it continued on an \n\nupward trend in civil engineering (Figure 8). Capacity uti­\n\nlization in civil engineering also declined less significantly \n\nthan in building construction (Figure 4).\n\nBecause of the considerable need for infrastructure expan­\n\nsion, civil engineering is likely to expand further in 2024 and \n\n2025. Strong stimuli are expected, primarily from the com­\n\nmercial investor side. New orders are already indicating sig­\n\nnificant growth (Figure 2): In commercial civil engineering, \n\nnew orders were nearly 30 percent higher in nominal terms \n\nin autumn 2023 compared to 2022. Large orders from the \n\nDeutsche Bahn are likely to be the decisive factor here, with \n\nmassive investments being made in the rail network. These \n\ninvestments will likely continue in 2024 and 2025, partly \n\nbecause the KTF funds earmarked for railway infrastructure \n\nappear to be secured. In addition, there are investments in \n\nthe mobility and energy transitions. New orders in road con­\n\nstruction, which is part of the public sector, are also trend­\n\ning upward, although with less momentum. A similar pic­\n\nture emerges for the existing orders (Figure 3).\n\nFollowing nominal growth of 9.5 percent in 2023 (real: \n\n2.6 percent) in civil engineering, it is expected to increase \n\nby only 1.8 (real: 3.6) percent this year and to expand again \n\nby 2.3 percent (real: 3.3 percent) in 2025 (Table 3).\n\nCivil engineering cannot compensate decline in \n\nbuilding construction\n\nReal construction volume is expected to decline for the third \n\nyear in a row in 2024. Following declines of 2.2 percent in \n\n2022 and of a little over one percent in 2023, construction \n\nvolume is likely to decline by 1.5 percent in price adjusted \n\nterms in 2024. Real growth in the total construction volume \n\nis not expected until 2025 (Table 4).\n\nHowever, the construction industry is divided. The some­\n\ntimes drastic declines in new residential construction are \n\n13 Christian Raffer and Henrik Scheller, KfW – Kommunalpanel 2023 (2023) (in German; available \n\nonline).\n\nthis results in a 2.1-percent decline in 2024 and 2.7 percent \n\ngrowth in 2025.\n\nEnergy-related renovation increases construction \n\non existing buildings\n\nConstruction on existing non-residential buildings has \n\nbecome less important over recent years: Between 2016 and \n\n2022, its share of total construction volume declined con­\n\ntinually (Table 2), primarily because the new construction \n\nvolume increased substantially. In 2023, this development \n\nis likely to have reversed: Higher energy prices increase the \n\nincentive to perform energy-related renovations. This is likely \n\nto have played a decisive role in the strong increase in ren­\n\novation and modernization.\n\nThe incentives will remain in 2024 and are likely to con­\n\ntinue to support renovation and modernization. There is \n\nFigure 8\n\nProduction in the construction industry\n\nIndex 2015 = 100, constant prices, trend component\n\n \n\nSource: Federal Statistical Office.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nCivil engineering production continued to trend upward in 2023 in contrast with \n\nbuilding construction.\n\n13\n\nDIW Weekly Report 1+2/2024\n\nCONSTRUCTION VOLUME CALCULATION\n\npartly counterbalanced by quite substantial increases in civil \n\nengineering. Even some structural engineering sectors, such \n\nas roofing and insulation, have a positive outlook for 2024 as \n\na result of increased energy-related renovation.\n\nOverall, real construction volume in the main construction \n\nindustry is likely to decline only slightly in 2023 and 2024. A \n\nsignificant increase of nearly two percent is expected for 2025. \n\nThe renovation sector will continue to be heavily impacted \n\nby the declines in residential construction. In 2024, the real \n\nconstruction volume in construction installation and other \n\nexpansion work will likely be 2.5 percent below the 2023 \n\nlevel again. Weak residential unit construction in particular \n\nis having a negative impact on other construction-related ser­\n\nvices such as architecture firms.

Nevertheless, many construction companies are fac­\n\ning major challenges. The differing outlooks for various sec­\n\ntors in the industry require major restructuring in its capac­\n\nity profile. In particular, it will be important to utilize the \n\nfreed-up capacities in the energy-related renovation of pri­\n\nvate and public buildings. In some cases, growth opportu­\n\nnities in civil engineering can only be realized by using cor­\n\nresponding capacities from building construction.\n\nPolicy makers should actively support restructuring in the \n\nconstruction industry. For example, inter-company training \n\nand retraining capacities could be expanded and funded. \n\nIn many cases, it will be crucial for the success of internal \n\nrestructuring for workers to receive wage replacement ben­\n\nefits from the short-time work allowance during this phase.\n\nThe continuing decline in new residential construction con­\n\ntinues to trigger major political pressure for action. The \n\nnumber of completed residential units will not increase in \n\nlight of shrinking investments in new construction over the \n\nnext years. The target of 400,000 new dwellings per year is \n\nthus becoming less and less likely to be achieved. In reac­\n\ntion to the low completion figures, among other things, the \n\nFederal Government passed a package of measures that \n\nshould incentivize the construction of affordable and cli­\n\nmate-friendly dwellings and stabilize the construction and \n\nreal estate industries.14\n\n14 Cf. the BMWSB website.\n\nHowever, initial assessments, particularly of tax incentives \n\nfrom degressive depreciation, indicate that a considerable \n\nincrease in the number of newly built residences is unlikely \n\nin the short to medium term.15 The focus, however, should \n\nbe less on the total number of newly constructed buildings. \n\nInstead, as the greatest imbalance between high housing \n\ndemand and low housing supply exists in metropolitan areas, \n\ncreating housing in the lower price segment should be pri­\n\noritized. Densification, which has been discussed for years, \n\ncan relieve the shortage in metropolitan areas specifically. In \n\nterms of cost, densification is more cost effective than cre­\n\nating residences on newly developed and expensive land. \n\nFurthermore, there are now cost-effective methods of add­\n\ning stories to existing buildings.\n\nThere is currently a great deal of uncertainty about how \n\nthe Federal Constitutional Court ruling will affect funding \n\nof construction activity and the longer-term funding of the \n\ntransition to climate neutrality. While clear agreements with \n\nfederal companies are emerging in civil engineering, there \n\nis particular uncertainty as to how energy-efficient build­\n\ning refurbishment and new residential construction will be \n\nfunded. Policy makers must quickly implement binding reg­\n\nulations here, especially with regard to the KfW, so that its \n\nfunding can continue.\n\n15 Claus Michelsen, Simon Junker, and Ferdinand Fichtner, “Simulation des Wachstums­\n\nchancengesetzes: Richtung stimmt, Effekte zu gering,” Economic Policy Brief, no. 9 (Verband \n\n Forschender Arzneimittelhersteller e.

Despite a nominal increase of six percen \n\nin construction expenses in 2023, i decreased by jus over \n\none percen in inflation-adjusted erms. In 2024, he nominal \n\nconstruction volume is likely o contrac by around 3.5 per­\n\ncent, declining for he firs ime since he financial crisis due o \n\nfalling construction prices. Residential construction in particu­\n\nlar experienced a sharp decline in 2023 and will continue on \n\nthis downward rend more strongly in 2024. Renovation and \n\nmodernization activity is less affected han new construction. \n\nThe situation will stabilize by 2025. The prospec of con­\n\nstructing 400,000 new residences annually is hus becoming \n\nincreasingly ou of reach. Only civil engineering is stabilizing \n\nthe construction industry overall; i is likely o expand in both \n\n2024 and 2025. The differen growth prospects of he sectors \n\nrequire restructuring in he construction industry. In particu­\n\nlar, capacities freed up in new residential construction should \n\nbe utilized in he energy-efficien renovation of private and \n\npublic buildings. Policy makers should actively suppor his \n\nrestructuring. In addition, hey should provide clarity abou he \n\nsubsidy programs for energy-efficien building renovation and \n\nresidential uni construction. A he same ime, i is importan \n\nto maintain focus on he new housing construction arget.\n\nThe construction industry in Germany continues o strug­\n\ngle. The crisis began in 2021 with material and supply bot­\n\ntlenecks and continued in 2022 and 2023 with he energy \n\ncrisis and loss of household purchasing power due o con­\n\nsumer price inflation. This was compounded by rapidly ris­\n\ning interes rates, which made i considerably more diffi­\n\ncul o finance construction projects, particularly for private \n\nhouseholds, bu also for companies. In particular, incoming \n\norders and building permits for new residential construc­\n\ntion plummeted las year. Due o he very dynamic devel­\n\nopmen of construction prices, he construction volume in \n\nnominal erms increased over he years, bu price-adjusted \n\ndeclines have already been recorded in almos all construc­\n\ntion sectors since 2021.\n\nNominal construction volume is expected o contrac in 2024. \n\nDue o declining capacity utilization and falling material \n\nprices, prices are likely o fall as well and a urnaround in \n\ninteres rates is expected in summer 2024. However, as prices \n\nand interes rates are likely o remain high overall and many \n\nsubsidy programs are in limbo, he building construction \n\nvolume in particular is likely o suffer and in some cases \n\ndecline considerably. Developmen is likely o improve in \n\n2025, bu strong growth is no expected.\n\nThese are he results of DIW Berlin’s calculations of he con­\n\nstruction volume,1 which includes construction investments \n\nas well as repairs ha do no increase value. Furthermore, in \n\naddition o construction in he narrower sense, he calcula­\n\ntions encompass related sectors, such as steel and ligh metal \n\nconstruction, he manufacture of prefabricated buildings, \n\nbuilding fi ings, planning, and other services. As a supple­\n\nmen o he investmen calculation of he Statistical Offices, \n\nDIW Berlin’s annual construction volume differentiates \n\n1 \n\nThe construction volume calculation is financed with funds from he Zukunf Bau research in­\n\nitiative of he Federal Ministry for Housing, Urban Developmen and Building (Bundesministerium \n\nfür Wohnen, Stadtentwicklung und Bauwesen, BMWSB).

This \n\nforecas (Box) is integrated into DIW Berlin’s Economic \n\nOutlook, particularly with regard o investmen activity. In \n\naddition o he presen estimates regarding he developmen \n\nof construction investment, he construction volume calcu­\n\nlation includes forecasts on he growth of new and existing \n\nhousing volumes in he building construction, residential, \n\nand non-residential sectors.3 Moreover, hese figures are \n\nused o derive he developmen rends of he core construc­\n\ntion industry and he renovation sector.\n\nResidential construction situation worsening\n\nThe pas hree years have been difficul for he residential \n\nconstruction sector. The enormous price increases—which \n\nbegan in 2021 due o supply bo lenecks and material short­\n\nages before hen being exacerbated by he energy crisis in \n\n2022—were compounded by he ECB’s key interes rate \n\nhikes, which had an impac on mortgage rates within a very \n\nshor period of ime: Between he end of 2021 and autumn \n\n2023, interes rates rose from 1.3 o over four percent. In \n\n2024, hey are now as high as hey were las in 2011 (Figure 1). \n\nFinancing conditions are currently almos impossible o \n\nmeet, especially for private households, resulting in projects \n\nbeing reduced, canceled, or no initiated a all. This is also \n\nreflected in new orders, which have been rending downward \n\nsince early 2022 and have only recently stabilized (Figure 2). \n\n3 Cf.

The forecasting variable, for example \n\nresidential construction volume, is regressed on an autore­\n\ngressive erm and on concurren as well as lagged values of \n\nthe respective indicator, for example new orders. The con­\n\nstruction volumes of new and existing buildings are estimated \n\nseparately.\n\nThe forecas equation is as follows:\n\n \n\ny stands for he value o be forecast, x for he indicator, and \n\nε for he statistical error erm. α, βi, and γj are he estimated \n\n parameters. The numbers of lags n and m (years) are deter­\n\nmined based on he autocorrelation or cross-correlation func­\n\ntion. The approach of estimating a large number of individual \n\nmodels and using average values for he forecas has proved \n\neffective. For an individual series, up o 1,500 single models \n\nare estimated. Construction permits, new orders and he order \n\nbacklog, production, interest, loan volumes, employmen and \n\nincome rends, and surveys of construction companies and \n\nfreelance architects have proven o be suitable indicators.1\n\nUsing his approach, a forecas with a prediction capability \n\nof up o wo years can be made for all aggregates. I should \n\nbe noted, however, ha he number of poin estimates used \n\nfor averaging decreases significantly as he forecas range \n\nincreases due o he differen prediction capabilities of he \n\nindividual indicators. To provide he forecas with additional \n\nstability, expectations for employmen and GDP for 2023 o \n\n2025 are herefore also included in he models as concurren \n\nindicators. Expected civil engineering volume is equal o he \n\ndifference between otal volume and construction volume.\n\nThe construction volume forecas for he previous year (2023) \n\nis also calculated using his method (nowcast).

However, saving is only \n\nworthwhile o a limited extent: The credi interes rates for \n\nlonger-term investments are currently only half as high as \n\nthe mortgage rate for en-year loans.\n\nThe fac ha households are increasingly switching o reno­\n\nvation and modernization measures is also reflected in he \n\ncosts for approved construction projects: A he star of 2022, \n\nthe costs for new construction and for work on existing build­\n\nings were still a similar levels. While permi figures and \n\nnew construction costs have almos halved, he figures for \n\nrenovation have remained a near constan levels (Figure 7).\n\nMeasures o increase energy efficiency are likely o con­\n\ntinue o play a central role: Energy prices, despite he \n\ndeclines in recen years, remain high and are expected o \n\nrise again somewha as a resul of he Federal Governmen \n\ninitiating an additional increase in he carbon price in he \n\nNachtragshaushaltsgesetz 2021 in reaction o he recen Federal \n\nConstitutional Cour ruling.11 This increases he incentives \n\nto inves in energy-related renovations.\n\n10 Christian Blanke and Katrin Klarhöfer, “Bestandsinvestitionen 2020: Struktur der Investitions­\n\ntätigkei in den Wohnungs­ und Nichtwohnungsbeständen,” BBSR Online Publikation, no. 39 (2022) \n\n(in German; available online).\n\n11 In November 2023, he Federal Constitutional Cour ruled agains he German government, \n\nprohibiting he reallocation of 60 billion euros borrowed under emergency legislation during he \n\nCOVID­19 pandemic owards he Climate and Transformation Fund.

For example, around 19 billion \n\neuros were planned for funding energy-efficien renovations \n\nin he building sector in he Klima- und Transformationsfonds \n\n(Climate and Transformation Fund, KTF) in 2024. While he \n\nFederal Governmen promised his funding immediately \n\nafter he Federal Constitutional Court’s ruling, he applica­\n\ntion process a KfW is still on hold. Thus, he developmen of \n\nrenovation work may also be slowed down or a leas delayed.\n\nOverall, renovation works are expected o decline by 4.1 per­\n\ncen his year, considerably less han new construction work. \n\nFor 2025, a further sligh decline of 0.3 percen is expected. \n\nPrice-adjusted, his results in minus 2.2 percen in 2024 and \n\nin 0.5 percen in 2025.\n\nMore robus developmen in non-residential \n\nconstruction han in residential construction\n\nNon-residential construction was more stable han residen­\n\ntial construction in 2023. The worsened financing conditions \n\nare likely o have affected companies less han households. \n\nWhile new orders for both public and commercial building \n\nconstruction declined somewha in 2023, hey are currently \n\nincreasing again due o multiple major projects (Figure 2). \n\nThus, existing orders remain a a record level (Figure 3).\n\nNevertheless, weak overall economic developmen and high \n\ninteres rates are dampening he outlook for commercial con­\n\nstruction. The global economy has developed less dynam­\n\nically recently; in 2023, German exports declined notice­\n\nably. The developmen of he German economy over he \n\ncourse of he year remains uncertain, partly due o he Federal \n\nConstitutional Cour ruling and despite he planned miti­\n\ngating measures, dampening both exports and investments \n\nin 2024.12 This is likely o keep companies from investing in \n\ncapacity expansion, for example by constructing new work­\n\nshops or warehouses.\n\nIn 2023, nominal non-residential construction increased by \n\n5.1 percent. In price-adjusted erms, however, i declined by \n\n0.9 percent. This developmen is expected o reverse in 2024: \n\nA nominal minus hree percen is expected, which, due o \n\nfalling prices, ends up as a real minus of nearly one percent. \n\nIn 2025, non-residential construction volume is expected \n\nto expand by 1.2 percen nominally and by 2.5 percen in \n\nprice-adjusted erms (Table 2).\n\nPublic construction projects supporting new \n\nconstruction of non-residential buildings\n\nThe demand for new commercial buildings has slowed due \n\nto weak economic development, which makes investments \n\nin new corporate buildings seem imprudent. Moreover, he \n\npossibility o work from home, which has become more prev­\n\nalen since he coronavirus pandemic, is dampening he need \n\n12 Bönke e al., “DIW Berlin Economic Forecast.”\n\nfor office buildings. In 2022 (the mos recen available sta­\n\ntistics), nearly a quarter of all employees partially worked a \n\nhome. This share is likely o no have declined significantly \n\nin 2023. Thus, he number of building permits for office and \n\nadministrative buildings has also continually declined since \n\n2020 (Figure 6). No stimuli are expected here.\n\nLarge projects are now stabilizing he order situation in he \n\npublic construction sector; existing orders have increased \n\nconsiderably (Figure 3). Funds ha have been created in \n\nrecen years should now gradually be converted into projec \n\nbudgets. Falling construction prices facilitate his develop­\n\nment.

Overall, however, he projects realized remained \n\nwell below he planned budget.13 Here, here is still much \n\npotential o expand construction work.\n\nWork on existing non-residential buildings is likely o decline \n\nby wo percen nominally in 2024 before increasing by a good \n\none percen in 2025. Due o he falling prices, he price-ad­\n\njusted growth is 0.1 percen for 2024 and 2.4 percen for 2025.\n\nOnly civil engineering o increase in 2024\n\nThe activity in he civil engineering sector stabilized he \n\nconstruction volume in 2023. While construction outpu in \n\nbuilding construction was on he decline, i continued on an \n\nupward rend in civil engineering (Figure 8). Capacity uti­\n\nlization in civil engineering also declined less significantly \n\nthan in building construction (Figure 4).\n\nBecause of he considerable need for infrastructure expan­\n\nsion, civil engineering is likely o expand further in 2024 and \n\n2025. Strong stimuli are expected, primarily from he com­\n\nmercial investor side. New orders are already indicating sig­\n\nnifican growth (Figure 2): In commercial civil engineering, \n\nnew orders were nearly 30 percen higher in nominal erms \n\nin autumn 2023 compared o 2022. Large orders from he \n\nDeutsche Bahn are likely o be he decisive factor here, with \n\nmassive investments being made in he rail network. These \n\ninvestments will likely continue in 2024 and 2025, partly \n\nbecause he KTF funds earmarked for railway infrastructure \n\nappear o be secured. In addition, here are investments in \n\nthe mobility and energy ransitions. New orders in road con­\n\nstruction, which is par of he public sector, are also rend­\n\ning upward, although with less momentum. A similar pic­\n\nture emerges for he existing orders (Figure 3).\n\nFollowing nominal growth of 9.5 percen in 2023 (real: \n\n2.6 percent) in civil engineering, i is expected o increase \n\nby only 1.8 (real: 3.6) percen his year and o expand again \n\nby 2.3 percen (real: 3.3 percent) in 2025 (Table 3).\n\nCivil engineering canno compensate decline in \n\nbuilding construction\n\nReal construction volume is expected o decline for he hird \n\nyear in a row in 2024. Following declines of 2.2 percen in \n\n2022 and of a li le over one percen in 2023, construction \n\nvolume is likely o decline by 1.5 percen in price adjusted \n\nterms in 2024.

In 2023, his developmen \n\nis likely o have reversed: Higher energy prices increase he \n\nincentive o perform energy-related renovations. This is likely \n\nto have played a decisive role in he strong increase in ren­\n\novation and modernization.\n\nThe incentives will remain in 2024 and are likely o con­\n\ntinue o suppor renovation and modernization.

Even some structural engineering sectors, such \n\nas roofing and insulation, have a positive outlook for 2024 as \n\na resul of increased energy-related renovation.\n\nOverall, real construction volume in he main construction \n\nindustry is likely o decline only slightly in 2023 and 2024. A \n\nsignifican increase of nearly wo percen is expected for 2025. \n\nThe renovation sector will continue o be heavily impacted \n\nby he declines in residential construction. In 2024, he real \n\nconstruction volume in construction installation and other \n\nexpansion work will likely be 2.5 percen below he 2023 \n\nlevel again. Weak residential uni construction in particular \n\nis having a negative impac on other construction-related ser­\n\nvices such as architecture firms.

Nevertheless, many construction companies are fac­\n\ning major challenges. The differing outlooks for various sec­\n\ntors in he industry require major restructuring in its capac­\n\nity profile. In particular, i will be importan o utilize he \n\nfreed-up capacities in he energy-related renovation of pri­\n\nvate and public buildings. In some cases, growth opportu­\n\nnities in civil engineering can only be realized by using cor­\n\nresponding capacities from building construction.\n\nPolicy makers should actively suppor restructuring in he \n\nconstruction industry. For example, inter-company raining \n\nand retraining capacities could be expanded and funded. \n\nIn many cases, i will be crucial for he success of internal \n\nrestructuring for workers o receive wage replacemen ben­\n\nefits from he short-time work allowance during his phase.\n\nThe continuing decline in new residential construction con­\n\ntinues o rigger major political pressure for action. The \n\nnumber of completed residential units will no increase in \n\nligh of shrinking investments in new construction over he \n\nnex years. The arge of 400,000 new dwellings per year is \n\nthus becoming less and less likely o be achieved. In reac­\n\ntion o he low completion figures, among other hings, he \n\nFederal Governmen passed a package of measures ha \n\nshould incentivize he construction of affordable and cli­\n\nmate-friendly dwellings and stabilize he construction and \n\nreal estate industries.14\n\n14 Cf. he BMWSB website.\n\nHowever, initial assessments, particularly of ax incentives \n\nfrom degressive depreciation, indicate ha a considerable \n\nincrease in he number of newly buil residences is unlikely \n\nin he shor o medium erm.15 The focus, however, should \n\nbe less on he otal number of newly constructed buildings. \n\nInstead, as he greates imbalance between high housing \n\ndemand and low housing supply exists in metropolitan areas, \n\ncreating housing in he lower price segmen should be pri­\n\noritized. Densification, which has been discussed for years, \n\ncan relieve he shortage in metropolitan areas specifically. In \n\nterms of cost, densification is more cos effective han cre­\n\nating residences on newly developed and expensive land. \n\nFurthermore, here are now cost-effective methods of add­\n\ning stories o existing buildings.\n\nThere is currently a grea deal of uncertainty abou how \n\nthe Federal Constitutional Cour ruling will affec funding \n\nof construction activity and he longer-term funding of he \n\ntransition o climate neutrality. While clear agreements with \n\nfederal companies are emerging in civil engineering, here \n\nis particular uncertainty as o how energy-efficien build­\n\ning refurbishmen and new residential construction will be \n\nfunded. Policy makers mus quickly implemen binding reg­\n\nulations here, especially with regard o he KfW, so ha its \n\nfunding can continue.\n\n15 Claus Michelsen, Simon Junker, and Ferdinand Fichtner, “Simulation des Wachstums­\n\nchancengesetzes: Richtung stimmt, Effekte zu gering,” Economic Policy Brief, no. 9 (Verband \n\n Forschender Arzneimi elhersteller e.
