    "By Mario Kendziorski, Lukas Barner, Claudia Kemfert, Christian von Hirschhausen, and Enno Wiebrow ABSTRACT The German electricity marke has recovered well from he 2022 energy crisis. Policymakers should now redirec he focus of energy policy o further expanding renewable energy sources. The year 2023 showed ha he German electricity supply remained secure following he shutdown of nuclear power plants. I is possible, affordable, and plausible in ligh of climate policy o cover 80 percen of electricity consumption with renewable energy sources, as he German Renewable Energy Sources Ac plans for by 2030. However, a swif exi from coal, and natural gas in he long run, is required o achieve his, as is suggested by scenario analyses ha rack the price and volume effects as well as he grid situation on the German electricity marke for he presen and for 2030. The shutdown of nuclear power plants has been planned for a long ime and was by no means a relevan driver of electricity prices. Rather, French nuclear power plants’ erratic downtimes as well as war-related increases in gas prices drove up elec­ tricity prices. The construction of new nuclear power plants, which has been discussed by policymakers, is irrelevan for the energy ransformation over he nex decades. The natural gas crisis has also ended. In addition o he coal phase-out, he fossil fuel phase-ou is an integral par of he energy ransfor­ mation. The 2023 German Renewable Energy Sources Ac (Erneuerbare- Energien-Gesetz, EEG) stipulates ha a leas 80 percen of electricity consumption mus come from renewable energy sources by 2030.1 This implies ha up o 600 erawa hours (TWh) mus be generated from renewable energy, compared to around 260 TWh oday. Policymakers somewha deprior­ itized his arge following he 2022 energy crisis. However, the German and European electricity markets have since sta­ bilized; electricity as well as natural gas prices are now abou the same as hey were before he star of he Russo-Ukrainian War (Figure 1). This clears he way for he nex steps o be taken, in particular accelerating he expansion of renewa­ ble energy sources and driving he coal phase-out, and sub­ sequently he natural gas phase-out, forward. This Weekly Repor updates earlier model-based scenario analyses2 and discusses he results from 2022 and beyond. Energy crisis is over; security of supply was never a risk Natural gas and electricity prices were already rending upward in he run-up o he Russo-Ukrainian War and prices increased further following he star of he war on February 24, 2022. However, electricity prices have fallen sharply since fall 2022 and are now around he pre-war price level. The same rend can be observed for natural gas prices. In ligh of a decline in natural gas consumption in he long run, he shock of he interrupted gas delivery from Russia was quickly absorbed.3 1 Paragraph 1 of he Renewable Energy Sources Ac (Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz, EEG) (in German; available online; accessed on April 8, 2024.

In a scenario for he year 2021, his Weekly Repor uses an electricity marke model o investigate how he shutdown of he remaining nuclear power plants would have affected the electricity mix, power flows, and prices during he ref­ erence year 2021 (Box 1). This year was selected as he ref­ erence year because he final six nuclear power plants were still connected o he grid in 2021. Moreover, he electric­ ity marke experienced shocks in 2022 due o he a ack on Ukraine. Choosing 2022 as he reference year would have significantly distorted he effects. In his study, we calculated wo variants, one with no nuclear power plants and one with six nuclear power plants, o make 4 See, for example, Enervis Energy Advisors GmbH, Ein Jahr Atomausstieg in Deutschland – Ein energiewirtschaftlicher Schulterblick (2024) (in German; available online). changes more clearly visible. In addition, using a second sce­ nario for 2030, we investigate how he electricity marke could develop in ligh of he planned coal phase-out. The las six nuclear power plants in Germany ha were still connected in 2021 had a combined installed capacity of 8.5 gigawa s (GW) gross and 8.1 GW net,5 with otal generation of 65.4 TWh in 2021. Following he shutdown of he Brokdorf, Grohnde, and Gundremmingen C nuclear power plants a he end of 2021, he final hree plants (Emsland, Neckarwestheim 2, and Isar 2) generated 32.8 TWh (around six percen of elec­ tricity production) in 2022.6 The model results for he 2021 scenario show ha in a static view, a combination of existing fossil fuel power plants would have compensated for hese amounts of electricity empo­ rarily (Figure 2). This would have led o an increase in CO2 emissions in he shor erm. However, in reality, his effec would have already been compensated for due o both he simultaneous expansion of renewable energy sources as well as a decline in electricity consumption. A historical evalua­ tion of he data shows ha CO2 emissions even declined in both 2022 and 2023. Between January 2021",
    "and January 2024 alone, 29 GW of photovoltaics were constructed in addition to a further 6.7 GW of onshore wind power and 0.6 GW of 5 The data comes from he Core Energy Marke Data Register (Marktstammdatenregister) of he Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) (in German; available online). 6 See AG Energiebilanzen e.V., Stromerzeugung nach Energieträgern (Strommix) von 1990 bis 2023 (in TWh) Deutschland insgesam (2024) (in German; available online).

Box 1 Methodology Calculations were conducted using an updated version of he ELMOD electricity marke model.1 Using a wo-phase mar­ ke simulation, he model determines a cost-minimal use of generation capacities a an hourly level. In line with he real marke clearing principle, he firs phase consists of comparing electricity demand and generation supply within he individual marke zones. Based on he meri order principle, he marke clearing price is determined by he marginal costs of he mos expensive power plan ha is required o mee demand cos effectively. In he second phase, he resulting power flows are simulated based on he marke result. This allows he use of power plants o be adjusted once again, which can preven bo lenecks in he electricity grid. Such measures are also known as redispatch measures. In order o ensure a high em­ poral resolution, generation units from neighboring countries are aggregated and combined into one node each. In addition, the ne ransfer capacities between neighboring marke areas are aken into accoun and a ransmission reliability margin of 20 percen of he ransmission capacity is introduced instead of he calculation of (n-1) security. This makes i possible o simulate an entire year in hourly resolution with a high level of detail when representing he German ransmission system. 1 The model was developed a TU Dresden. See Florian Leuthold, Hannes Weigt, and Christian von Hirschhausen, “ELMOD – A model of he European Electricity Market,” (work­ ing paper WP-EM-00, Dresden University of Technology Electricity Market, 2008) (available online). The model has previously been used in various DIW Berlin projects (such as Claudia Kemfert, Friedrich Kunz, and Juan Rosellón, “A welfare analysis of electricity ransmission planning in Germany,” Energy Policy 94 (2016): 446–452 (available online). Today i is main­ tained and developed further a DIW Berlin. Curren calculations are based on Enno Wiebrow e al., “The Effects of Nuclear Power Plan Closures in Germany 2021–2023 on Network Flows and Redispatch – Update of Earlier ELMOD Modeling Results,” Presentation a Enerday, Dresden, April 12, 2024. 132 DIW Weekly Repor 16+17+18/2024 ELECTRICITY MARKET offshore wind power, which, when combined, generated an estimated 40 TWh of additional electricity in his period.7 Over he years, German energy policy and infrastructure have adapted o he nuclear phase-out, resulting in no price spikes even",
    "after he final reactors were shu down in April 2023.8 The challenges of he las winters, especially he energy supply risks ha were caused by he Russo-Ukrainian War, were overcome successfully and showed ha Germany can maintain security of supply withou nuclear energy while simultaneously driving he energy ransformation forward. Electricity price effects mainly caused by erratic nuclear power plan outages in France While he final nuclear power plants played a small role in the German electricity sector due o heir small share in he electricity mix, nuclear energy is he dominan power gen­ eration echnology in France. There, nuclear power plants 7 The data for he expansion of power generation facilities are from he Core Energy Marke Data Register. The additional generation was estimated using he full load hours for he years 2021, 2022, and 2023. 8 See statements from he Vice Presiden of he Federal Network Agency, Barbie Kornelia Haller, in he Bayerischer Rundfunk: Lorenz Storch, “Ein Mona Atomausstieg: Der Strom wurde sogar billiger,” BR24 from May 15, 2023 (in German; available online). generated 318 TWh of electricity in 2023, which is around two hirds of otal ne electricity generation.9 Nuclear energy thus plays a much more significan role in he French elec­ tricity marke han in he German. More han half of France’s nuclear power plants were disconnected from he grid from time o ime in summer 2022 due o maintenance work, cor­ rosion problems, and reduced river levels (Figure 3).10 This led o a significan increase in demand for imported electricity in France. Closing his supply gap exacerbated he already ense situation (as a resul of high natural gas prices) and led o further price increases. The electricity price in Germany over he pas years shows tha generation from he las German nuclear power plants only had a small overall impac on he price. More impactful were he raw material prices for fossil fuels, such as hard coal and natural gas in particular, as hese power plants mostly determine he price on he day-ahead marke in he hours tha renewable energy sources canno cover demand.11 The shutdown of he final nuclear power plants in Germany on April 15, 2023, did no resul in a higher electricity price. On he contrary, he price even fell in he following month as, among other hings, marke participants anticipated he shutdown date in good ime. In he hypothetical analysis for 2021, he model calculations resul in an average electricity price ha is 11 euros per MWh higher withou he nuclear power plants in operation, which would be a price increase of abou 11 percent.12 However, his change is low compared to he electricity price increase ha was caused by higher raw material prices, especially natural gas. In he nuclear phase-ou discussion, hese amounts are basi­ cally negligible compared o he otal costs of nuclear energy, which have been paid for since he star of commercial use primarily by ransferring risk o society a large or via sub­ sidies. The costs",
    "of interim and final storage of radioactive waste have so far been completely neglected even hough these are also significan in Germany and will increase con­ siderably over ime (Box 2).13 9 Data based on he ENTSO-E Transparency Platform (available online). 10 Cf.

Box 2 Nuclear energy is no an option for he energy transformation Nuclear energy has failed o become a key pillar of he German and global energy supply. Nuclear echnology was and is complex, risky and hus more expensive han other energy sources from he outset. Nuclear power plants have no been competitive since he firs commercial plants were commissioned in he 1950s and his is still he case oday.1 In addition, nuclear energy entails proliferation risks, such as misuse for weapons development. The lack of competitiveness is exacerbated if he neglected costs of dismantling he plants and disposing of radioactive waste are aken into account. This means ha he minor benefits of nuclear energy are offse by considerable long-term costs ha are no foreseeable from today’s perspective. Debates abou new reactor concepts (also known as fourth-generation reactors) do nothing o change this.2 New reactor concepts have been discussed for more than 60 years, inspired by he dream of a plutonium economy, bu canno be implemented in large quantities and with sys­ temic relevance in he foreseeable future.3 Nuclear energy is by no means experiencing a global renais­ sance. On he contrary, he outpu of nuclear power plants worldwide fell by one gigawa in 2023, while solar power plants with an outpu of 440 gigawa s were constructed.4 With the exception of China, he construction of new nuclear power plants has practically come o a standstill, and even in China the share of nuclear energy is below five percent. Only hree countries ha previously did no have nuclear power plants are now building new plants or having hem built, as Russia provides both he echnology and financing as a par of its nuclear diplomacy: Turkey, Bangladesh, and Egypt. There is no nuclear energy renaissance; rather,",
    "i is in decline around the world. Thus, nuclear energy is no a relevan option for he energy ransformation in he coming decades. 1 Cf.

Mycle Schneider e al., World Nuclear Industry Status Repor 2023 (2024) (available online). 134 DIW Weekly Repor 16+17+18/2024 ELECTRICITY MARKET increased by around four TWh (Figure 4).15 For compari­ son, here was around 21.5 TWh of redispatch in 2021 and the figure increased o 32.5 TWh and 33.1 TWh in 2022 and 2023, respectively; his corresponds o around five percen of German electricity consumption.16 One driver of bo le­ necks is very windy days in which renewable energy canno be ransported o he south sufficiently. The hree nuclear power plants located in he north of Germany, Brokdorf, Emsland, and Grohnde, increase he bo leneck in such a situation.17 German grid operators have already adjusted to largely renewable electricity generation anyway. Various options are currently being discussed for he medium-term design of grid managemen in a largely renewable electric­ ity system, such as nodal or zonal pricing systems.18 In addi­ tion, he entire sector design mus be developed for a renew­ able electricity system. Coal phase-ou and 80 percen renewable energy are possible by 2030 To investigate he longer-term effects on he German elec­ tricity system, a scenario for 2030 is calculated in which all nuclear and coal-fired power plants have been shu down. The basic assumption for his calculation is ha he German government’s expansion argets for wind power (115 GW of onshore wind power, 30 GW of offshore wind power) and photovoltaic systems (215 GW) have been achieved, he installed capacity of gas-fired power plants (34.7 GW) roughly corresponds o he curren level, and biomass power plants (12.8 GW) are used o cover peak loads.19 In addition, an increase in gross electricity consumption from 525 TWh in 202320 o 750 TWh in 2030 is accounted for, which is mainly caused by he increase in electricity demand from electric cars and hea pumps. The model calculations show ha a coal phase-ou is still pos­ sible by 2030 (Figure 5). The wind and solar energy expansion targets will resul in around",
    "80 percen of electricity demand being covered by renewable energy sources in 2030. Periods with li le solar or wind generation could be compensated for with flexibility options, for example with flexible demand 15 During a redispatch, individual power plants are shu down or started up contrary o he pre­ viously agreed generation plans. For more information, see he DIW Berlin Glossary (in German; available online). 16 Bundesnetzagentur, Netzengpassmanagement, 4. Quartal 2023 (2024) (in German; available online). 17 The costs incurred by redispatch are passed on o households hrough grid charges. The shutdown of nuclear power plants and he expansion of renewable energy sources led o addition­ al redispatch and hus o a moderate increase in grid charges from 7.8 cents per kWh in 2021 o 8.08 cents per kWh in 2022 and o 9.52 cents per kWh in 2023. However, a greater price effec can be seen in he area of electricity procuremen costs. In 2022, private households paid an average of 16.97 cents per kWh for he procuremen and distribution of electricity, compared o an aver­ age price paid for procuremen and distribution of jus 7.93 cents per kWh in 2021.

In 2030, natural gas power plants would still provide 18 percen of annual generation, bu would have a strong negative rend.22 During imes with lots of generation potential from solar and wind energy, surplus electricity can be exported, while electricity can be imported from neighboring countries when renewable sources are generating li le electricity. This leads to an overall sligh ne impor of nine TWh. As a par of its power plan strategy, he German Federal Governmen is planning a ender for a otal of en GW of nat­ ural gas power plants, which will be financed by he Climate and Transformation Fund. The subsidized natural gas power plants should be H2 ready and switch o hydrogen operation 21 The additional electricity demand can be shifted by price signals o hours in which sufficien electricity is available o avoid peak loads. Buffer",
    "anks integrated into hea pumps make ypical­ ly a few hours of flexibility possible. Electric cars, independen of heir consumption profile and ba ery size, have several hours of flexibility. In he industrial sector, electricity demand can be reduced by adjusting o high energy prices. 22 These values can vary by a few percentage points depending on he weather year used as he reference year. The weather year 2019 was selected as he reference year for he 2030 scenario. between 2035 and 2040.23 However, according o he curren state of he echnology, switching from natural gas o com­ plete use of hydrogen is no an easy process.24 Therefore, there is he danger ha expanding natural gas power plants could lead o further lock-in effects and delay he natural gas phase-ou more.25 From a system ransformation perspec­ tive, i is herefore necessary ha he power plants required for he energy ransformation are designed from he outse to run purely on hydrogen. Conclusion: With he crisis over, more focus should be on renewable energy The German electricity marke has recovered well from he crises in 2022 and its security of supply was never a risk a any ime. In particular, natural gas prices had already eased by he beginning of 2023 and electricity and gas prices are 23 Bundesregierung, Für eine klimafreundliche und sichere Energieversorgung (2024) (in German; available online). 24 See Joonsik Hwang, Krisha Maharjan, and HeeJin Cho, “A review of hydrogen utilization in power generation and ransportation sectors: Achievements and future challenges,” International Journal of Hydrogen Energy 48, no. 74 (2023): 28629–28648 (available online). 25 See Claudia Kemfer e al., “The expansion of natural gas infrastructure puts energy ransi­ tions a risk,” Nature Energy 7 (2022): 582–587 (available online).

Thus, i is ime for policymakers o redirec focus away from he crises and onto the expansion of renewable energy sources. Grid stability was never a risk a any poin during he energy crisis. The shutdown of he nuclear power plants did no lead o additional grid bo lenecks on any significan scale. Questions regarding sector design and network congestion managemen mus be clarified in he ransformation o a completely renewable electricity supply. Scenario analyses have shown ha an electricity supply withou nuclear power plants would have been possible in 2021. They also show ha an electricity supply withou nuclear and coal-fired power is possible in he future and ha he EEG’s arge of generating a leas 80 percen of electricity from renewables is feasible. To achieve his, however, renewable energy sources mus",
    "be expanded even more and fossil fuels mus be phased ou in the near future. Along with he coal phase-out, he natural gas phase-ou is an integral par of he energy ransformation.
