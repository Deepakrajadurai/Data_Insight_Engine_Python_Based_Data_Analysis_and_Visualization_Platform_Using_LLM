Studies have shown that satisfied people have \n\nbetter relationships, are more productive, and have a longer \n\nlife expectancy. General life satisfaction is being discussed as \n\nan alternative measure of prosperity beyond GDP. Thus, find­\n\nings on this topic are relevant for both the scientific commu­\n\nnity as well as policymakers. This Weekly Report investigates \n\nthe income, work, and health satisfaction of the German popu­\n\nlation from 2004 to 2021. Using data from the Socio-Economic \n\nPanel, we investigate if there are differences in satisfaction \n\nbetween genders, regions (east/west), age groups, parental \n\nstatus, and income groups. The analysis shows that general \n\nlife satisfaction as well as income, work, and health satisfac­\n\ntion have either increased or remained constant since 2004. \n\nHowever, differences between groups, some quite significant, \n\nstill remain, especially in terms of health satisfaction. Com­\n\nparatively, low-income earners and parents are dissatisfied. \n\nTo counter this, policy measures to unburden parents and \n\nimprove the childcare system are needed.\n\nSubjective well-being has a significant impact on the quality \n\nof life in a society. Psychological and medical studies have \n\nshown that people who are more satisfied have better rela­\n\ntionships,1 are more productive at work,2 and even have a \n\nlonger life expectancy.3 Subjective well-being is also a topic \n\nof research in economics.4 The discussion around subjective \n\nwell-being as a measure of human progress is being revived \n\nas the suitability of GDP as a measure of human progress \n\nis being questioned due to climate change and increasingly \n\nscare resources.5 Findings on the subjective well-being of the \n\nGerman population are thus extremely relevant for both sci­\n\nence and policymakers.\n\nThe literature differentiates between affective well-being—\n\nthe frequency with which people experience positive and neg­\n\native feelings—and cognitive well-being, how people eval­\n\nuate their life overall compared to their ideal vision of it.6 \n\nStudies capture cognitive well-being by estimating general \n\nlife satisfaction as well as satisfaction in individual domains. \n\nWhile the majority of the literature focuses on general life \n\nsatisfaction, there are relatively few studies on satisfaction \n\nwith different life domains. This Weekly Report contributes \n\nto the literature by analyzing inequalities in satisfaction in \n\nthree different domains: personal income, work, and health. \n\nWork is a key part of life for most adults, and work satisfac­\n\ntion thus plays an important role in the well-being of most \n\nadults in Germany. The same applies to satisfaction with \n\npersonal income; income enables social participation and \n\n1\t\n\nShannon More and Ed Diener, “Types of subjective well-being and their associations with rela­\n\ntionship outcomes,” Journal of Positive Psychology and Wellbeing 3, no. 2 (2019): 112–118.\n\n2\t Jesús F.

As health is the \n\nbasis for all aspects of life, health satisfaction is a key indi­\n\ncator for participation in all parts of life.\n\nFor the analysis, we use data from the Socio-Economic Panel \n\n(SOEP), one of the few datasets in Germany that contains \n\nrepresentative data on general life satisfaction as well as on \n\nsatisfaction with different life domains (Box).7 The analy­\n\nsis period is from 2004 to 2021, as income satisfaction has \n\nbeen included in the SOEP since 2004.8 Differences between \n\nwomen and men, east and west Germany, people with and \n\nwithout children, people below and above 30, and people \n\nwith low, middle, and high net household incomes are ana­\n\nlyzed descriptively in this period.9 These indicators have \n\nalready shown meaningful differences in other analyses.10 \n\nThe respondents rated their satisfaction with different life \n\ndomains on a scale from 0 (not at all satisfied) to 10 (com­\n\npletely satisfied). The findings of this analysis can inform \n\npolicymakers in which life domains and for which popu­\n\nlation groups measures to increase well-being are particu­\n\nlarly relevant.\n\n7 Jan Goebel et al., “The German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP),” Journal of Economics and Sta­\n\ntistics 239, no. 2 (2010): 345–360.\n\n8 This analysis uses data that covers up to 2021.\n\n9 We differentiate between different income terciles.\n\n10 Theresa M.

In \n\n2004, for example, general life satisfaction was rated the high­\n\nest with an average of 6.7 points, while personal income sat­\n\nisfaction was lowest with an average of 5.5 points. By 2021, \n\nboth values had improved, with satisfaction with personal \n\nincome (6.9) rising less steadily but more strongly than gen­\n\neral life satisfaction (7.4). In comparison, the increase in real \n\nwages during a similar period, 2004 to 2019, was around ten \n\npercent.11 Similarly, although not quite as steeply, work sat­\n\nisfaction increased from 6.8 to 7.2. In contrast, health satis­\n\nfaction has remained constant over the years at around 6.5. \n\nIts only increase, to 6.9, occurred during the coronavirus \n\npandemic in 2021.\n\nWomen and east Germans have caught up in \n\nterms of income satisfaction\n\nThere are considerable gender differences when it comes \n\nto personal income satisfaction: Compared to women, men \n\nhave been consistently more satisfied with their income over \n\nthe years (Figure 2).12 In 2004, men were around 0.4 points \n\n11 Guido Zinke, Lohnentwicklung in Deutschland und Europa (2020: Bundeszentrale für politische \n\nBildung) (in German; available online).\n\n12 This refers to labor income only.

Households and their \n\nmembers in Germany have been surveyed on their general \n\nlife situation on an annual basis since 1984.1 These surveys \n\ncover education, the labor market situation, and health of the \n\nrespondents. As of 2024, around 30,000 respondents from \n\naround 15,000 households are surveyed annually. Data on \n\ngeneral life satisfaction and on personal income, work, and \n\nhealth satisfaction of the SOEP respondents were used for the \n\nanalysis. Specifically, the respondents were asked: “How satis­\n\nfied are you currently with [life domain]?” The respondents in­\n\ndicated their satisfaction on a scale of 0 (not at all satisfied) to \n\n10 (completely satisfied). The question about work satisfaction \n\nwas only posed to people who are working. The question about \n\nhealth satisfaction was posed to all people living in Germany. \n\nTo be able to make better comparisons over time, refugees are \n\nnot included in the analysis.\n\n1 \n\nJan Goebel et al., “The German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP),” Journal of Economics and \n\nStatistics 239, no. 2 (2019): 345–360.\n\n214\n\nDIW Weekly Report 32+33+34/2024\n\nSATISFACTION\n\nFigure 2\n\nIncome satisfaction\n\nScale from 0 (not at all satisfied) to 10 (completely satisfied)\n\n \n\nSource: Authors’ calculations based on SOEP data. \n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nOver the years, men have been consistently more satisfied with their personal income than women.\n\n215\n\nDIW Weekly Report 32+33+34/2024\n\nSATISFACTION\n\nmore satisfied with their personal income than women. In \n\n2007, their satisfaction increased to 0.6 points. After this, how­\n\never, women’s satisfaction began to catch up and men were \n\nonly 0.2 points more satisfied than women by 2021. While \n\npersonal income satisfaction has increased over time for both \n\nmen and women, the increase was much greater for women. \n\nWhile there are many reasons for the gender gap in personal \n\nincome satisfaction, the main reason is likely that women \n\nstill earn less than men. In 2005, the gender pay gap was \n\naround 16.8 percent. By 2021, it had shrunk to 13.5 percent.13 \n\nThus, women and men have converged in terms of income \n\nsatisfaction, similarly to how they are converging in wages.\n\nThere are also differences between east and west Germany. \n\nFor example, people in east Germany are considerably more \n\ndissatisfied with their personal income compared to peo­\n\nple in west Germany. The average value in east Germany \n\nwas 4.9 points in 2004 compared to an average 5.7 points \n\nin west Germany. By 2021, the personal income satisfaction \n\ngap between east and west Germany had shrunk consider­\n\nably. In 2021, east Germans (6.7) were nearly as satisfied as \n\nwest Germans (6.9). The pay gap between east and west, \n\nwhich has become smaller over the years, may be relevant \n\nhere. While the gross hourly wage in east Germany was only \n\naround 75 percent of the gross hourly wage in west Germany \n\nin 2004, it had increased to around 87 percent in 2021.14\n\nIn regards to age, people below 30 were considerably less sat­\n\nisfied with their personal income (4.9) than people above 30 \n\n(5.7), although the gap has decreased over the years. In 2021, \n\nfor example, younger adults’ personal income satisfaction \n\nwas 6.5, while it was 6.9 for older adults over 30. People who \n\nare finishing training or an apprenticeship or who recently \n\nbegan their professional career were increasingly more sat­\n\nisfied with their personal income. One possible reason for \n\nthis could be how the labor market has changed over the \n\nlast 20 years. The early 2000s were characterized by unem­\n\nployment and limited labor market prospects, especially for \n\nyoung people.15 By 2022, half of all companies were affected \n\nby a shortage of skilled professionals.16 This is likely to have \n\nhad a positive impact on starting salaries and the general \n\nlabor market for young people. This was then possibly also \n\nreflected in young people’s income satisfaction.\n\nIn terms of household income, the respondents are divided \n\ninto three groups of equal size and compared: the lowest \n\nincome earners (first tercile), the middle-income earners \n\n(second tercile), and the highest income earners (third ter­\n\ncile). Unsurprisingly, personal income satisfaction differs \n\n13 OECD, “Gender Wage Gap,” (2024) (available online; accessed on June 20, 2024.) Relative dif­\n\nferences in the mean values (median) are reported.\n\n14 Jannik André Nauerth and Johan Pflanz, “Lohnlücke Ost-West – Ewige Disparität oder schiefer \n\nVergleich?” Ifo Dresden berichtet 30, no. 5 (2023): 8–13.\n\n15 Sandra Buchholz und Karin Kurz, “Increasing employment instability among young people? \n\nLabor market entries and early careers in Germany since the mid-1980s,” FlexCAREER Working Pa­\n\nper no. 3 (2005); Brigitte Schels, “Job entry and the ways out of benefit receipt of young adults in \n\nGermany,” IAB-Discussion Paper 16 (2009).\n\n16 Andreas Peichl, Stefan Sauer, and Klaus Wohlrabe, \"Fachkräftemangel in Deutschland und Eu­\n\nropa–Historie, Status quo und was getan werden muss,\" ifo Schnelldienst, 75, no. 10 (2022): 70–75.\n\ndepending on household income.17 While respondents with \n\nthe lowest household incomes were comparatively unsat­\n\nisfied with their personal income (4.3) in 2004, those with \n\nmiddle (5.6) or high incomes (6.6) were significantly more \n\nsatisfied. While these differences are considerable, the gaps \n\ndid narrow to some extent in 2021: The gap between the \n\nhighest and middle incomes shrank (from 1.0 to 0.8) and \n\nthe gap between the lowest and middle incomes remained \n\nthe same (1.2). In principle, this gap indicates that the addi­\n\ntional satisfaction from additional income decreases along \n\nthe income distribution.\n\nThere are no discernible differences between people with \n\nand without children over the entire period; both are equally \n\nsatisfied with their income.\n\nDifferences in work satisfaction are comparably \n\nlow\n\nWorking women and men in Germany are similarly satis­\n\nfied with their work (Figure 3). Considering that women, on \n\naverage, report lower satisfaction with their personal income \n\non average, this similarity is remarkable. While women are \n\nmore dissatisfied than men in terms of their income, other \n\naspects of their jobs, like colleagues, work hours, field, and \n\nthe demands placed on such aspects do not appear to result \n\nin differences in work satisfaction.\n\nCompared to west Germany, people in east Germany were \n\nmore dissatisfied with their work from 2004 to 2018. Despite \n\nthis, the gap shrunk from 0.5 to 0.3 points in this period and \n\nthere have been no more differences between the regions \n\nsince 2019. One possible explanation for these differences \n\nand the subsequent convergence could be economic differ­\n\nences between east and west Germany. For historical reasons, \n\nthe economic structure in east Germany differs greatly from \n\nthat in west Germany. For example, people in east Germany \n\nfrequently work in different professions than people in west \n\nGermany.18 The headquarters and research departments of \n\nlarge companies are still located in the west. Above all, how­\n\never, unemployment in east Germany was high for a long \n\ntime, which likely resulted in a far more pronounced fear of \n\nunemployment in the east.19 This could lead to average work \n\nsatisfaction being lower in east Germany compared to west \n\nGermany. Catch-up processes may ultimately have led to a \n\nconvergence of work satisfaction in east and west Germany.\n\nWhen comparing people under and over 30, it is noticeable \n\nthat the under-30 group has, on average, greater work sat­\n\nisfaction than the over-30 group. This gap remained largely \n\nconstant over the observation period. However, the differ­\n\nence in work satisfaction was only 0.2 points in 2021. This \n\n17 For this analysis, the net household income was needs-adjusted using the square root of the \n\nhousehold size. Further, it was deflated using the consumer price index.\n\n18 Jannik André Nauerth and Johan Pflanz, “Lohnlücke Ost-West – Ewige Disparität oder schiefer \n\nVergleich?” Ifo Dresden berichtet 30, no. 5 (2023): 8–13.\n\n19 Michaela Fuchs et al., “Baustelle Arbeitsmarkt – die Beschäftigungsdynamik in Ost und West \n\nhat sich angeglichen,” IAB-Forum 9 (2018) (available online).\n\n216\n\nDIW Weekly Report 32+33+34/2024\n\nSATISFACTION\n\nFigure 3\n\nWork satisfaction\n\nScale from 0 (not at all satisfied) to 10 (completely satisfied)\n\n \n\nSource: Authors’ calculations based on SOEP data. \n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nDifferences in work satisfaction are only observed between the different income groups. \n\n217\n\nDIW Weekly Report 32+33+34/2024\n\nSATISFACTION\n\ncould be related to the fact that younger people have not \n\nbeen working for very long and thus still have a multitude \n\nof career development possibilities and paths before them, \n\nwhich decrease with age. At the same time, younger peo­\n\nple often do not yet have any additional family responsibili­\n\nties and may therefore not require as much flexibility from \n\ntheir employers.\n\nThe greatest differences in work satisfaction are between \n\nthe groups with different household incomes. Low-income \n\nearners (first tercile) were the most dissatisfied with work, \n\nfollowed by middle-income earners and high-income earn­\n\ners (second and third terciles). The differences were great­\n\nest between the lowest and middle income terciles. The dif­\n\nference was around 0.5 points in 2004 but had sunk to 0.3 \n\npoints by 2021, and the gap between the middle and high­\n\nest incomes sank from 0.4 to 0.2. One possible explanation \n\nfor this is that people from the bottom third of earners more \n\nfrequently have jobs with poor working conditions, such as \n\nshift work, little schedule flexibility, and significant physi­\n\ncal and mental burdens. These are factors that have been \n\nproven to negatively affect work satisfaction.20\n\nSimilar to gender, no significant differences can be found \n\nbetween people with and without children over the obser­\n\nvation period.\n\nMen have higher health satisfaction than women\n\nOn average, men were more satisfied with their health than \n\nwomen (Figure 4): While men reported health satisfaction of \n\n6.6 points in 2004, women reported only 6.3. The time series \n\nof the two ran almost parallel until 2020. In 2021, both values \n\nincreased by around 0.3 points, likely an effect of the corona­\n\nvirus pandemic. Thus, men report, on average, that they are \n\nin better health than women. Moreover, studies show that \n\nmen go to the doctor less frequently and are also less likely \n\nto be absent from work due to illness.21 However, men die \n\nearlier and are more affected by some common diseases than \n\nwomen. At the same time, women suffer more frequently \n\nfrom some hormone-related physical and mental illnesses, \n\nespecially in relation to the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, birth, \n\nand menopause. Thus, when observing different indicators of \n\nhealth, it is often unclear whether women or men are health­\n\nier. Differing gender norms could also explain the continu­\n\ning gap in health satisfaction between men and women. For \n\nexample, studies have shown that most people find it socially \n\ninacceptable for men to talk about their health problems.22\n\nThere are also ongoing differences between people with and \n\nwithout children: On average, parents were more dissatisfied \n\nwith their health (6.2 in 2004) than people without children \n\n20 Sarah A. Burgard and Katherine Y. Lin, “Bad Jobs, Bad Health?

The gap increased to 0.6 points by 2021, with the health \n\nsatisfaction of people without children increasing in particu­\n\nlar (7.3 compared to 6.7 for parents). As parenthood is associ­\n\nated with stress factors, such as less and worse sleep,23 rela­\n\ntionship problems,24 less time for relaxation,25 and finan­\n\ncial issues,26 this is not surprising. Numerous studies have \n\nalready shown that many people are less satisfied with their \n\nphysical or mental health after becoming parents.27\n\nDifferences between east and west Germany have lessened \n\nover time: People in east Germany were more dissatisfied \n\nwith their health than people in west Germany. In 2004, the \n\ndifference was 0.4 points and by 2021, it had shrunk to only \n\n0.1 points. Many east Germans have fragmented employ­\n\nment histories due to their experiences post-reunification. \n\nAt the same time, significant health differences between \n\npeople of high and low socioeconomic status, for example \n\napproximated by employment status, are well documented \n\nin the scientific literature.28\n\nCompared to people over 30, people under 30 were 1.4 \n\npoints more satisfied with their health on average in 2004. \n\nSurprisingly, this difference had been steadily decreasing \n\nuntil 2021; that year, the difference was only 1.1 points. One \n\nexplanation for this convergence could be that the state of \n\nhealth in old age is steadily improving across birth cohorts.29\n\nWhen looking at the different household income groups, peo­\n\nple from the bottom third were the least satisfied with their \n\nhealth, followed by people from the middle third, while the \n\nhighest income earners were the most satisfied with their \n\nhealth.

Studies have shown ha satisfied people have \n\nbe er relationships, are more productive, and have a longer \n\nlife expectancy. General life satisfaction is being discussed as \n\nan alternative measure of prosperity beyond GDP. Thus, find­\n\nings on his opic are relevan for both he scientific commu­\n\nnity as well as policymakers. This Weekly Repor investigates \n\nthe income, work, and health satisfaction of he German popu­\n\nlation from 2004 o 2021. Using data from he Socio-Economic \n\nPanel, we investigate if here are differences in satisfaction \n\nbetween genders, regions (east/west), age groups, parental \n\nstatus, and income groups. The analysis shows ha general \n\nlife satisfaction as well as income, work, and health satisfac­\n\ntion have either increased or remained constan since 2004. \n\nHowever, differences between groups, some quite significant, \n\nstill remain, especially in erms of health satisfaction. Com­\n\nparatively, low-income earners and parents are dissatisfied. \n\nTo counter his, policy measures o unburden parents and \n\nimprove he childcare system are needed.\n\nSubjective well-being has a significan impac on he quality \n\nof life in a society. Psychological and medical studies have \n\nshown ha people who are more satisfied have be er rela­\n\ntionships,1 are more productive a work,2 and even have a \n\nlonger life expectancy.3 Subjective well-being is also a opic \n\nof research in economics.4 The discussion around subjective \n\nwell-being as a measure of human progress is being revived \n\nas he suitability of GDP as a measure of human progress \n\nis being questioned due o climate change and increasingly \n\nscare resources.5 Findings on he subjective well-being of he \n\nGerman population are hus extremely relevan for both sci­\n\nence and policymakers.\n\nThe literature differentiates between affective well-being—\n\nthe frequency with which people experience positive and neg­\n\native feelings—and cognitive well-being, how people eval­\n\nuate heir life overall compared o heir ideal vision of it.6 \n\nStudies capture cognitive well-being by estimating general \n\nlife satisfaction as well as satisfaction in individual domains. \n\nWhile he majority of he literature focuses on general life \n\nsatisfaction, here are relatively few studies on satisfaction \n\nwith differen life domains. This Weekly Repor contributes \n\nto he literature by analyzing inequalities in satisfaction in \n\nthree differen domains: personal income, work, and health. \n\nWork is a key par of life for mos adults, and work satisfac­\n\ntion hus plays an importan role in he well-being of mos \n\nadults in Germany. The same applies o satisfaction with \n\npersonal income; income enables social participation and \n\n1\t\n\nShannon More and Ed Diener, “Types of subjective well-being and heir associations with rela­\n\ntionship outcomes,” Journal of Positive Psychology and Wellbeing 3, no. 2 (2019): 112–118.\n\n2\t Jesús F.

As health is he \n\nbasis for all aspects of life, health satisfaction is a key indi­\n\ncator for participation in all parts of life.\n\nFor he analysis, we use data from he Socio-Economic Panel \n\n(SOEP), one of he few datasets in Germany ha contains \n\nrepresentative data on general life satisfaction as well as on \n\nsatisfaction with differen life domains (Box).7 The analy­\n\nsis period is from 2004 o 2021, as income satisfaction has \n\nbeen included in he SOEP since 2004.8 Differences between \n\nwomen and men, eas and wes Germany, people with and \n\nwithou children, people below and above 30, and people \n\nwith low, middle, and high ne household incomes are ana­\n\nlyzed descriptively in his period.9 These indicators have \n\nalready shown meaningful differences in other analyses.10 \n\nThe respondents rated heir satisfaction with differen life \n\ndomains on a scale from 0 (no a all satisfied) o 10 (com­\n\npletely satisfied).

In \n\n2004, for example, general life satisfaction was rated he high­\n\nes with an average of 6.7 points, while personal income sat­\n\nisfaction was lowes with an average of 5.5 points. By 2021, \n\nboth values had improved, with satisfaction with personal \n\nincome (6.9) rising less steadily bu more strongly han gen­\n\neral life satisfaction (7.4). In comparison, he increase in real \n\nwages during a similar period, 2004 o 2019, was around en \n\npercent.11 Similarly, although no quite as steeply, work sat­\n\nisfaction increased from 6.8 o 7.2. In contrast, health satis­\n\nfaction has remained constan over he years a around 6.5. \n\nIts only increase, o 6.9, occurred during he coronavirus \n\npandemic in 2021.\n\nWomen and eas Germans have caugh up in \n\nterms of income satisfaction\n\nThere are considerable gender differences when i comes \n\nto personal income satisfaction: Compared o women, men \n\nhave been consistently more satisfied with heir income over \n\nthe years (Figure 2).12 In 2004, men were around 0.4 points \n\n11 Guido Zinke, Lohnentwicklung in Deutschland und Europa (2020: Bundeszentrale für politische \n\nBildung) (in German; available online).\n\n12 This refers o labor income only.

Households and heir \n\nmembers in Germany have been surveyed on heir general \n\nlife situation on an annual basis since 1984.1 These surveys \n\ncover education, he labor marke situation, and health of he \n\nrespondents. As of 2024, around 30,000 respondents from \n\naround 15,000 households are surveyed annually. Data on \n\ngeneral life satisfaction and on personal income, work, and \n\nhealth satisfaction of he SOEP respondents were used for he \n\nanalysis. Specifically, he respondents were asked: “How satis­\n\nfied are you currently with [life domain]?” The respondents in­\n\ndicated heir satisfaction on a scale of 0 (no a all satisfied) o \n\n10 (completely satisfied). The question abou work satisfaction \n\nwas only posed o people who are working. The question abou \n\nhealth satisfaction was posed o all people living in Germany. \n\nTo be able o make be er comparisons over ime, refugees are \n\nno included in he analysis.\n\n1 \n\nJan Goebel e al., “The German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP),” Journal of Economics and \n\nStatistics 239, no. 2 (2019): 345–360.\n\n214\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 32+33+34/2024\n\nSATISFACTION\n\nFigure 2\n\nIncome satisfaction\n\nScale from 0 (no a all satisfied) o 10 (completely satisfied)\n\n \n\nSource: Authors’ calculations based on SOEP data. \n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nOver he years, men have been consistently more satisfied with heir personal income han women.\n\n215\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 32+33+34/2024\n\nSATISFACTION\n\nmore satisfied with heir personal income han women. In \n\n2007, heir satisfaction increased o 0.6 points. After his, how­\n\never, women’s satisfaction began o catch up and men were \n\nonly 0.2 points more satisfied han women by 2021. While \n\npersonal income satisfaction has increased over ime for both \n\nmen and women, he increase was much greater for women. \n\nWhile here are many reasons for he gender gap in personal \n\nincome satisfaction, he main reason is likely ha women \n\nstill earn less han men. In 2005, he gender pay gap was \n\naround 16.8 percent. By 2021, i had shrunk o 13.5 percent.13 \n\nThus, women and men have converged in erms of income \n\nsatisfaction, similarly o how hey are converging in wages.\n\nThere are also differences between eas and wes Germany. \n\nFor example, people in eas Germany are considerably more \n\ndissatisfied with heir personal income compared o peo­\n\nple in wes Germany. The average value in eas Germany \n\nwas 4.9 points in 2004 compared o an average 5.7 points \n\nin wes Germany. By 2021, he personal income satisfaction \n\ngap between eas and wes Germany had shrunk consider­\n\nably. In 2021, eas Germans (6.7) were nearly as satisfied as \n\nwes Germans (6.9). The pay gap between eas and west, \n\nwhich has become smaller over he years, may be relevan \n\nhere. While he gross hourly wage in eas Germany was only \n\naround 75 percen of he gross hourly wage in wes Germany \n\nin 2004, i had increased o around 87 percen in 2021.14\n\nIn regards o age, people below 30 were considerably less sat­\n\nisfied with heir personal income (4.9) han people above 30 \n\n(5.7), although he gap has decreased over he years. In 2021, \n\nfor example, younger adults’ personal income satisfaction \n\nwas 6.5, while i was 6.9 for older adults over 30. People who \n\nare finishing raining or an apprenticeship or who recently \n\nbegan heir professional career were increasingly more sat­\n\nisfied with heir personal income. One possible reason for \n\nthis could be how he labor marke has changed over he \n\nlas 20 years. The early 2000s were characterized by unem­\n\nploymen and limited labor marke prospects, especially for \n\nyoung people.15 By 2022, half of all companies were affected \n\nby a shortage of skilled professionals.16 This is likely o have \n\nhad a positive impac on starting salaries and he general \n\nlabor marke for young people. This was hen possibly also \n\nreflected in young people’s income satisfaction.\n\nIn erms of household income, he respondents are divided \n\ninto hree groups of equal size and compared: he lowes \n\nincome earners (firs ercile), he middle-income earners \n\n(second ercile), and he highes income earners (third er­\n\ncile). Unsurprisingly, personal income satisfaction differs \n\n13 OECD, “Gender Wage Gap,” (2024) (available online; accessed on June 20, 2024.) Relative dif­\n\nferences in he mean values (median) are reported.\n\n14 Jannik André Nauerth and Johan Pflanz, “Lohnlücke Ost-Wes – Ewige Disparitä oder schiefer \n\nVergleich?” Ifo Dresden berichte 30, no. 5 (2023): 8–13.\n\n15 Sandra Buchholz und Karin Kurz, “Increasing employmen instability among young people? \n\nLabor marke entries and early careers in Germany since he mid-1980s,” FlexCAREER Working Pa­\n\nper no. 3 (2005); Brigi e Schels, “Job entry and he ways ou of benefi receip of young adults in \n\nGermany,” IAB-Discussion Paper 16 (2009).\n\n16 Andreas Peichl, Stefan Sauer, and Klaus Wohlrabe, \"Fachkräftemangel in Deutschland und Eu­\n\nropa–Historie, Status quo und was getan werden muss,\" ifo Schnelldienst, 75, no. 10 (2022): 70–75.\n\ndepending on household income.17 While respondents with \n\nthe lowes household incomes were comparatively unsat­\n\nisfied with heir personal income (4.3) in 2004, hose with \n\nmiddle (5.6) or high incomes (6.6) were significantly more \n\nsatisfied. While hese differences are considerable, he gaps \n\ndid narrow o some exten in 2021: The gap between he \n\nhighes and middle incomes shrank (from 1.0 o 0.8) and \n\nthe gap between he lowes and middle incomes remained \n\nthe same (1.2). In principle, his gap indicates ha he addi­\n\ntional satisfaction from additional income decreases along \n\nthe income distribution.\n\nThere are no discernible differences between people with \n\nand withou children over he entire period; both are equally \n\nsatisfied with heir income.\n\nDifferences in work satisfaction are comparably \n\nlow\n\nWorking women and men in Germany are similarly satis­\n\nfied with heir work (Figure 3). Considering ha women, on \n\naverage, repor lower satisfaction with heir personal income \n\non average, his similarity is remarkable. While women are \n\nmore dissatisfied han men in erms of heir income, other \n\naspects of heir jobs, like colleagues, work hours, field, and \n\nthe demands placed on such aspects do no appear o resul \n\nin differences in work satisfaction.\n\nCompared o wes Germany, people in eas Germany were \n\nmore dissatisfied with heir work from 2004 o 2018. Despite \n\nthis, he gap shrunk from 0.5 o 0.3 points in his period and \n\nthere have been no more differences between he regions \n\nsince 2019. One possible explanation for hese differences \n\nand he subsequen convergence could be economic differ­\n\nences between eas and wes Germany. For historical reasons, \n\nthe economic structure in eas Germany differs greatly from \n\ntha in wes Germany. For example, people in eas Germany \n\nfrequently work in differen professions han people in wes \n\nGermany.18 The headquarters and research departments of \n\nlarge companies are still located in he west. Above all, how­\n\never, unemploymen in eas Germany was high for a long \n\ntime, which likely resulted in a far more pronounced fear of \n\nunemploymen in he east.19 This could lead o average work \n\nsatisfaction being lower in eas Germany compared o wes \n\nGermany. Catch-up processes may ultimately have led o a \n\nconvergence of work satisfaction in eas and wes Germany.\n\nWhen comparing people under and over 30, i is noticeable \n\ntha he under-30 group has, on average, greater work sat­\n\nisfaction han he over-30 group. This gap remained largely \n\nconstan over he observation period. However, he differ­\n\nence in work satisfaction was only 0.2 points in 2021. This \n\n17 For his analysis, he ne household income was needs-adjusted using he square roo of he \n\nhousehold size.

A he same ime, younger peo­\n\nple often do no ye have any additional family responsibili­\n\nties and may herefore no require as much flexibility from \n\ntheir employers.\n\nThe greates differences in work satisfaction are between \n\nthe groups with differen household incomes. Low-income \n\nearners (firs ercile) were he mos dissatisfied with work, \n\nfollowed by middle-income earners and high-income earn­\n\ners (second and hird erciles). The differences were great­\n\nes between he lowes and middle income erciles.

One possible explanation \n\nfor his is ha people from he bo om hird of earners more \n\nfrequently have jobs with poor working conditions, such as \n\nshif work, li le schedule flexibility, and significan physi­\n\ncal and mental burdens. These are factors ha have been \n\nproven o negatively affec work satisfaction.20\n\nSimilar o gender, no significan differences can be found \n\nbetween people with and withou children over he obser­\n\nvation period.\n\nMen have higher health satisfaction han women\n\nOn average, men were more satisfied with heir health han \n\nwomen (Figure 4): While men reported health satisfaction of \n\n6.6 points in 2004, women reported only 6.3.

Thus, men report, on average, ha hey are \n\nin be er health han women. Moreover, studies show ha \n\nmen go o he doctor less frequently and are also less likely \n\nto be absen from work due o illness.21 However, men die \n\nearlier and are more affected by some common diseases han \n\nwomen. A he same ime, women suffer more frequently \n\nfrom some hormone-related physical and mental illnesses, \n\nespecially in relation o he menstrual cycle, pregnancy, birth, \n\nand menopause. Thus, when observing differen indicators of \n\nhealth, i is often unclear whether women or men are health­\n\nier. Differing gender norms could also explain he continu­\n\ning gap in health satisfaction between men and women. For \n\nexample, studies have shown ha mos people find i socially \n\ninacceptable for men o alk abou heir health problems.22\n\nThere are also ongoing differences between people with and \n\nwithou children: On average, parents were more dissatisfied \n\nwith heir health (6.2 in 2004) han people withou children \n\n20 Sarah A.

The gap increased o 0.6 points by 2021, with he health \n\nsatisfaction of people withou children increasing in particu­\n\nlar (7.3 compared o 6.7 for parents). As parenthood is associ­\n\nated with stress factors, such as less and worse sleep,23 rela­\n\ntionship problems,24 less ime for relaxation,25 and finan­\n\ncial issues,26 his is no surprising. Numerous studies have \n\nalready shown ha many people are less satisfied with heir \n\nphysical or mental health after becoming parents.27\n\nDifferences between eas and wes Germany have lessened \n\nover ime: People in eas Germany were more dissatisfied \n\nwith heir health han people in wes Germany. In 2004, he \n\ndifference was 0.4 points and by 2021, i had shrunk o only \n\n0.1 points. Many eas Germans have fragmented employ­\n\nmen histories due o heir experiences post-reunification. \n\nA he same ime, significan health differences between \n\npeople of high and low socioeconomic status, for example \n\napproximated by employmen status, are well documented \n\nin he scientific literature.28\n\nCompared o people over 30, people under 30 were 1.4 \n\npoints more satisfied with heir health on average in 2004. \n\nSurprisingly, his difference had been steadily decreasing \n\nuntil 2021; ha year, he difference was only 1.1 points. One \n\nexplanation for his convergence could be ha he state of \n\nhealth in old age is steadily improving across birth cohorts.29\n\nWhen looking a he differen household income groups, peo­\n\nple from he bo om hird were he leas satisfied with heir \n\nhealth, followed by people from he middle hird, while he \n\nhighes income earners were he mos satisfied with heir \n\nhealth. The gaps between he groups were around 0.4 points \n\neach and have remained relatively constan over he years. \n\nThis may reflec he well-documented socio-economic dif­\n\nferences in health in Germany.30\n\n23 David Richter e al., “Long-term effects of pregnancy and childbirth on sleep satisfaction and \n\nduration of first-time and experienced mothers and fathers,” Sleep 42, no. 4 (2019): zsz015.\n\n24 Manon A. van Scheppingen e al., “Self-Esteem and Relationship Satisfaction During he Tran­\n\nsition o Motherhood,” Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 114, no. 6 (2018): 973–991.\n\n25 Amy Claxton and Maureen Perry-Jenkins, “No Fun Anymore: Leisure and Marital Quality \n\nAcross he Transition o Parenthood,” Journal of Marriage and Family 70, no. 1 (2008): 28–43.\n\n26 Ma hias Pollmann-Schult, “Parenthood and Life Satisfaction: Why Don’ Children Make People \n\nHappy?” Journal of Marriage and Family 76, no. 2 (2014): 319–336.\n\n27 Michael D.

The bo om hird of income earners as \n\nwell as parents are especially dissatisfied with heir health. \n\nI canno be policy makers’ intention ha low income and \n\nparenthood are risk factors for well-being. I is heir duty \n\nto relieve hese groups; hey could star by improving he \n\nchildcare system, reducing bureaucracy when applying \n\nfor benefits, and making low-threshold suppor services \n\nmore visible.\n\nJEL: D60, D63\n\nKeywords: Well-being, satisfaction, domains, inequality\n\nDr. Laura Buchinger is a Research Associate a he Humbold University of \n\nBerlin | laura.buchinger@hu-berlin.de\n\nDr. Theresa Entringer is a Research Associate in he Socio-Economic Panel \n\nResearch Infrastucture a DIW Berlin and a he University of Greifswald | \n\ntentringer@diw.de\n\nDr. Daniel Graeber is a Research Associate in he Socio-Economic Panel \n\nResearch Infrastucture a DIW Berlin | dgraeber@diw.de"
