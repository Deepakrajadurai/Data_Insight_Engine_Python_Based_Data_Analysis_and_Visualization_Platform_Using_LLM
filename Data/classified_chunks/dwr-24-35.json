    "Pagenhardt, Marie Rullière, Jan-Christopher Scherer, Teresa Schildmann, Ruben Staffa, and Kristin Trautmann ABSTRACT The German economy continues o stagnate. After i appeared to finally be growing a he star of 2024, i experienced a sligh setback in he second quarter. Although incomes are rising and inflation is now near he wo-percen arget, people in Ger­ many are saving heir money. As investments and exports fal­ tered due o he sluggish industrial sector, he upturn has been delayed for he ime being. Overall economic outpu is likely o stagnate in 2024, bu i will likely pick up a he end of he year; growth of 0.9 and 1.4 percen is expected in 2025 and 2026, respectively. Private consumption, which will increase more slowly han expected bu still provide a stimulating effect, will primarily suppor his growth. As interes rates continue o fall worldwide, foreign rade and investments are also supporting growth. The global economy has returned o its recovery path, bu expanded more weakly in he second quarter compared to he first. Growth in China in particular has stalled somewhat, and here are also signs of an upcoming economic slowdown in he United States. Following growth of 3.8 percen in 2024, the global economy is expected o expand by only 3.5 percen in 2025, bu develop more dynamically again in 2026. Global economy: recovery expected o continue, while he US economy cools off The global economy weakened in he second quarter of 2024. Following a 1.0-percen increase in he firs quarter, i only grew by 0.7 percen in he second (Figure 1). Growth stalled in he emerging economies in particular; his was due o he developmen in China, where domestic demand remained weak. In contrast, a bi more momentum came from he advanced economies, especially he United States and he euro area, where inflation rates continued o decline. This resulted in a firs interes rate cu in he euro area in June. Carried by consumption and exports, he advanced econo­ mies expanded by 0.6 percen in he second quarter. The euro area economy remained on its recovery path and grew again by 0.3 percent. Foreign rade in particular made a positive contribution o growth due o rising exports. Spain (0.8 per­ cent) and he Netherlands (1.0 percent) provided particularly strong suppor for he economic recovery in he euro area. France and Italy also recorded positive quarterly growth in the second quarter, with 0.3 percen each. Germany was he only major euro area country o make a negative contribu­ tion o growth with -0.1 percent. In he United Kingdom, economic outpu continued o rise significantly by 0.6 per­ cent, supported primarily by a strong increase in inventories. The US economy also experienced strong growth of 0.7 per­ cen in he second quarter, still driven by robus consumer spending and corporate investments. In contras o its neg­ ative star o he year, Japan's GDP expanded by 0.8 percent. Tax relief and real wage growth as a resul of larger wage increases have spurred",
    "private consumption. Among he emerging economies, which expanded by 0.8 per­ cen overall, only China performed poorly: The Chinese econ­ omy grew by merely 0.7 percen in he second quarter, com­ pared o a strong 1,5 percen in he first. Negative factors, such as he still struggling real estate market, subdued domestic demand, and severe storms and flooding dampened growth, while fiscal and monetary policy measures only had a limited 225 DIW Weekly Repor 35–39/2024 DIW BERLIN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK impac on he problems in he real estate market.1 In contrast, strong foreign demand and governmen investments in he high-tech sector contributed positively o growth. The Indian economy continued o expand hanks o strong domestic economic activity. The Mexican and Brazilian economies continued o grow, although momentum is slowing some­ what. Restrictive monetary policy had an impac in hese countries and he expor sector fel he effects of he weaker global economy. Poland stands ou among he Central and Southeastern European countries with impressive quarterly growth of 1.5 percent. In he curren hird quarter, mos advanced economies are expected o contribute a bi less o he recovery han pre­ viously. In particular, he US economy is likely o contrac slightly as a resul of less dynamic consumption and a dete­ riorating situation in he labor market. By contrast, he euro area economy withou Germany is likely o continue its recov­ ery path. Steady growth in real wages will probably strengthen domestic demand. No momentum is expected from he euro area industry: While he Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Indices (PMI) of he individual euro area coun­ tries in he firs half of 2024 still showed signs of recovery, they have been declining again since June. Companies are pessimistic in erms of political uncertainty (France), declin­ ing orders and rising prices for intermediary goods and labor costs (Spain, Netherlands, Italy). The outlook is also deteriorating in mos Member States in he services sector, bu he indices remain above he expansion hreshold. The mood has improved in France due o he Olympic Games. The outlook for he hird quarter for he United Kingdom is good: Both he upward rend in he PMIs in all economic sectors and he rise in consumer confidence poin o a fur­ ther recovery. Real wage increases are likely o continue boosting consumption. In Japan, he recovery in domestic demand is providing sligh growth stimuli in he hird quar­ ter. A he same ime, here are also only very weak signals for a recovery in he Japanese manufacturing industries; he PMI has been stuck below he expansion hreshold of 50 for two months in a row. Growth is expected o be stronger in he emerging econo­ mies in he hird quarter han in he second quarter. The Indian economy should continue o grow dynamically. The Chinese economy is likely o benefi from rising exports and investments in he high-tech sector. Despite all he stimulat­ ing monetary and fiscal policy measures, domestic demand is likely o continue o suffer from he problems",

Despite still pending or already initiated interes rate cuts, monetary policy in he advanced economies is likely o remain restrictive.

In he United States, a urnaround in interes rates is likely in mid-September in response o steadily falling inflation. In contrast, he Bank of Japan decided on a further interes rate hike in July due o high inflation and a weak yen. This is a sign ha he years of ultra-expansive mone­ tary policy are coming o an end, bu have led o short-lived global stock marke urbulence. Central banks in many emerging economies have been cut­ ting key interes rates for some ime now. Key interes rates have been declining regularly in Brazil due o falling infla­ tion rates and weak economic growth. There were also inter­ es rate cuts in Mexico in March and August, although hey were more moderate due o persisten inflation. The People’s Bank of China is following a more expansive course due o deflationary endencies.

International rade is recovering slowly; powerful growth rates are no expected in 2024 overall. The ongoing global industrial weakness in he advanced economies will likely still weigh on international rade in 2025. Falling interes rates, however, should revive corporate investment, and hus also international rade, from mid 2025. Over he res of he forecas period, global growth rates are expected o be muted in 2025 before becoming more dynamic in 2026 (Table 1). In winter 2024/2025, inflation rates in many places will reach he arge corridor of he central banks. As interes rates fall, monetary policy in mos econ­ omies will switch from a restrictive policy o a more neu­ tral one by he end of 2025, hereby supporting economic Box 1 Assumptions and framework conditions This forecas is based on he following assumptions abou he further developmen of key interes rates, exchange rates, and commodity prices (Table). These assumptions were made based on previous development, futures markets prices, and he closing prices on he date of his forecas (Augus 19, 2024). The European Central Bank (ECB) firs decreased interes rates in June. After a year of stable interes rates, i has now initiated a urnaround. Six further interes rate cuts are assumed over he forecas hori­ zon, which are likely o ake place a every second ECB meeting. Specifically, i is assumed ha he ECB will cu interes rates for he second ime in September, again by 25 basis points. A he same time, he Central Bank will, as announced, decrease he interes rate corridor between he main refinancing rate and he deposi rate from 50 o 15 basis points. For some ime now, he ECB has been steering he economy via he deposi rate and no he main refinancing rate. The deposi rate is hus he key indicator for inter­ es rate changes. The subsequen interes rate cuts are assumed to be 25 basis points each, which results in a reduction of he de­ posi rate by 75 basis points in both 2024 and 2025. Money marke interes rates fell a he beginning of 2024 in antic­ ipation of he interes rate urnaround. I is assumed ha hese, in line with key interes rates, will continue o fall over he forecas horizon. The refinancing costs for households and companies are likely o decline as key interes rates fall over he coming years. The return on governmen bonds increased again slightly fol­ lowing a brief decline a he",
    "beginning of 2024. I is assumed ha capital marke interes rates will remain largely unchanged over the forecas horizon a 2.4 percen for Germany and 3.1 percen for he euro area. The euro has recently depreciated agains he US dollar due o he interes rate differential. For he forecas peri­ od, i is assumed ha he exchange rate of EUR o USD will remain a 1.09 USD per EUR. Uncertainties abou he gas supply in he coming year resulted in sligh increases in he wholesale price for gas (TTF) recently. However, well-filled gas storage facilities should preven a severe supply shortage. According o futures, he average gas price should be around 34.50 (2024), 41.90 (2025), and 35.70 euros (2026) per megawa hours. The price for Bren crude oil will de­ cline slightly over he forecas horizon according o raded futures. In 2024, he average price is likely o be 84,60 USD per barrel be­ fore i declines o an average of 76,70 USD per barrel in 2025 and finally o 73,70 USD per barrel in 2026. This forecas is also based on political assumptions: We assume ha no further escalations will occur, bu also ha none of he curren geopolitical crises, such as he Israeli-Hamas War, he Russo-Ukrainian War, and he con­ flic between China and Taiwan, will end.

In he advanced economies, he opposing rends between he United States and Europe are likely o con­ verge. While he United States has lef he euro area behind in erms of growth over he pas years, he situation here now seems o be deteriorating, while signs in he euro area are pointing o growth again. The gradual slowdown in economic momentum in he United States is primarily being driven by declining private consumption and he labor market. However, he labor mar­ ke seems o be more robus han he unemploymen rate, which has been higher since spring, would suggest. The unemploymen rate is likely overstated due o he immigra­ tion boom. Even if some indicators poin",
    "o an increased risk of a recession in he United States, a gradual slowdown in the pace of expansion seems more likely, especially as he US Federal Reserve has sufficien leeway o cu interes rates. In he euro area, on he other hand, he purchasing power of private households is likely o increase further hanks to lower inflation and higher nominal wages, even if real wages in he euro area are still one percentage poin below pre-pandemic levels and even further below pre-energy cri­ sis levels (Figure 2). The positive situation on he labor mar­ ke will likely continue o suppor he economy, although i has worsened slightly recently. Japanese GDP is likely o be above its potential growth in 2025 due o recovering domes­ tic demand and growing exports. The outlook for mos emerging economies over he forecas period is favorable.

Chinese GDP is likely o con­ tinue its powerful development, bu growth rates are likely to be lower han before he pandemic. The previous invest­ ment-driven growth model seems o have reached its lim­ its and has no been replaced by private consumption so far. On an annual average, he advanced economies are expected to expand by only 1.7 percen in 2024, while economic out­ pu will likely increase by 4.9 percen in he emerging econ­ omies. Overall, he global economy is expected o grow by 3.8 percen in 2024, 0.1 percentage points more han fore­ cas in summer. In 2025, global growth is likely o be some­ wha weaker a 3.5 percent, due o he US economy cooling down, before growing more dynamically again by 3.7 per­ cen in 2026. Thus, he forecas for 2025 is 0.1 percentage points less han expected in summer. This forecas is subjec o many uncertainty factors. For example, he inflation rates, especially in he United States and he euro area, could decline more slowly han expected, which would resul in a longer phase of restrictive mone­ tary policy and hus dampen economic growth. If inflation fell more quickly, in contrast, i could suppor consumption more and lead o more rapid interes rate cuts. Geopolitical risks remain quite high. The war in he Middle Eas could escalate further, which would likely lead o higher oil and natural gas prices. The war in Ukraine, he developmen of which is difficul o predict, is a further risk. Donald Trump’s possible re-election in November could lead o major uncer­ tainties regarding he direction of US economic and security policy. The rade conflic between China and he Wes could also escalate further and have a negative impac on interna­ tional rade. Generally, he risk of political polarization is high in many places; extremis parties are gaining ground worldwide. In he long erm, his populism harbors consid­ erable risks for growth and prosperity prospects, especially if i ignores or undermines fundamental economic principles. Figure 2 Real wages in",

Following a sligh 0.2 percen increase in GDP a the beginning of he year, his positive developmen did no continue: Economic outpu contracted slightly by 0.1 percen in he second quarter (Figure 33). A recovery failed o materi­ alize. On he one hand, private household consumption was significantly lower han he increase in disposable income since he energy crisis had suggested. On he other hand, investments in equipmen and in construction slumped and exports declined, probably primarily due o persisten low domestic and foreign demand for industrial goods. Private consumption contracted somewha in he second quarter: Private households seem o be unse led, both due to he political and economic conditions as well as he low bu steady rise in unemployment. This likely resulted in consumers consuming less in he second quarter han hey did a he beginning of he year, despite strong increases in real wages. In line with his, private households are saving a bi more of heir income: A 10.8 percent, he savings rate is currently slightly higher han in 2023.4 Consumer senti­ men is dampened, likely due o he high price level. While inflation has stabilized noticeably recently and consistently been under hree percen since he beginning of 2024, core inflation and he price increases in he services sector in par­ ticular have remained elevated, likely having curbed con­ sumption. As expected in early summer, he UEFA European Men’s Football Championship did no noticeably boos pri­ vate consumption in Germany. Foreign rade also did no provide any growth stimuli in the second quarter. While strong exports of intermediate goods, such as chemical and plastic products, had indicated a recovery in he global industry5 and hus German rade a he beginning of he year, exports of hese goods signifi­ cantly declined again in he second quarter. Although ravel boosted service exports, i was unable o preven he decline in exports overall. Service imports also experienced strong growth, while goods imports fell slightly. Overall, imports stagnated, resulting in a slightly negative balance of exports and imports in he second quarter. The decline in investments was even greater. Particularly pri­ vate investmen in equipmen suffered a serious slump; in the second quarter, i was a its lowes level since he produc­ tion restrictions during he coronavirus pandemic. In con­ trast, public equipmen investmen had a stimulating effect. The downward rend of recen years also continued in con­ struction investment, which declined significantly, mainly in residential and public construction. 3 Detailed figures on he forecas for he Germany economy can be found in he online appendix (in German). 4 The general revision",
    "of he VGR data results in he savings rate for Germany being revised downward significantly. Until recently, he data showed a significantly higher savings rate level than was he case before he coronavirus pandemic. 5 For more, see he section on he global economy in his Weekly Report. The evolution of gross value added (GVA) in he second quar­ ter shows ha he gap between he services and manufactur­ ing sectors is growing. Overall, GVA declined by 0.1 percent, the same rate as GDP. While production declined slightly in manufacturing, i plummeted in he construction industry. As a result, he manufacturing industry as a whole reduced GVA by 0.3 percent. Services increased slightly, supporting GVA by 0.1 percent. However, i was a mixed picture in he individual economic sectors. Value added in he consum­ er-related sectors decreased, while business-related services were able o expand heir production. This developmen in value added is also reflected in he lates labor marke figures: employmen has continued o rise overall, albei a a slightly slower rate han a he beginning of he year. Employmen expanded in he services sector bu declined in he ailing manufacturing industry as well as construction. Overall, however, he labor marke has so far remained stable, even if unemploymen is rising. Stagnation expected in he hird quarter for he German economy The recovery of he German economy is likely o remain elusive in he curren hird quarter; GDP is no projected to increase (Table 2). Private consumption is still projected to expand, although less powerfully han was implied in spring (Figure 4). Consumer confidence indicators, which rose steadily during he firs half of 2024, have recently expe­ rienced a sligh downturn.

A he same ime, he strong real wage increases since mid-2023 have extensively compensated for the losses during he energy crisis and are expected o suppor consumption in he second half of 2024.

Income for higher income groups, in contrast, has increased somewha less strongly han previously. As a result, labor income inequality should remain he same his year (Figure 5). Additionally, consumer price inflation is contin­ ually declining, and—especially hanks o decreasing energy prices—fell below he wo-percen arge for he firs ime since March 2021 in August 2024, bringing he annual aver­ age closer o he inflation",
    "arge of he European Central Bank (ECB). Leading price indicators such as impor and whole­ sale prices also sugges his. Although some of hese indi­ cators are rising again, he rates remain well below wo per­ cent. Stable price developmen should strengthen consumer confidence once more and stimulate private consumption. Robus employmen expansion, which he services sector will likely continue o drive, should also suppor private con­ sumption. Cyclical unemploymen is expected o continue to rise slightly due o weak economic developmen (Table 3). Investments are expected o make a negative contribution o economic growth again in he curren quarter. Investmen in equipmen continues o suffer due o weak industrial pro­ duction and a lack of demand; he stock of existing orders is shrinking while new orders are faltering. In construction, despite he initiated interes rate shift, he persistently high interes rates and he high and continuously rising construc­ tion costs remain he key obstacles and are likely o further slow down residential construction in he second half of he year. Although he volume of new residential construction loans has increased somewha again recently, his is no ye reflected in he approval and order figures. Corporate capac­ ity utilization in building construction recently declined o its lowes value since 2010. In contrast, civil engineering is expected o continue o suppor construction investment. The demand from abroad for German intermediate and capi­ tal goods is also likely o remain weak in he curren quarter. The ifo Expor Expectations fell for he hird ime in a row in August; hus, another decline in goods exports is expected for he hird quarter. Service exports, which make up a good 20 percen of German foreign rade, should expand further due o he growing importance of he domestic and foreign service sectors. The IT sector in particular as well as our­ is raffic are carrying his development, although hey are unlikely o be able o increase otal exports. In ligh of weak exports and sluggish industrial output, imports are expected to continue o develop meekly, although goods imports are also expected o fall and services imports o increase in he curren global and domestic economic environment. Overall, a negative rade balance is projected for he hird quarter.

Although sentimen in both sectors has recently deteriorated somewha according o he Purchasing Manager Indices for Germany, sentimen remains more robus and above he expansion hreshold of 50 points in the services sector, supported by growing demand. In he industrial sector, in contrast, he index is consistently below the expansion hreshold. According o he ifo Business Climate Index survey in August, he business climate in the industrial sector has fallen for he hird ime in a row, with he respondents rating both he curren situation and future business as critical. The lack of orders is increas­ ingly becoming a problem and will likely impede produc­ tion in he curren quarter. Gradual recovery over he course of he forecast The German economy is expected o recover over he course of he forecast, although more sluggishly han he indica­ tors suggested during he summer. In erms of he domes­ tic economy,",
    "he positive real wage rend, which should be supported by low inflation rates and continue hroughou he forecas period, is likely o have he greates impac initially. While employees’ bargaining power has weakened somewha with he sligh decline in he Labor Shortage Index, he col­ lective wage negotiations planned for he end of 2024, such as in he public sector as well as he metalworking and elec­ trical industry, are expected o resul in further strong nom­ inal wage increases. Unemploymen will reach its peak a the beginning of 2025 and decline as he economy recovers and integration processes, particularly of Ukrainian refu­ gees, progress. This developmen benefits private consump­ tion, which is expected o suppor economic outpu a he turn of he year. Governmen consumption should continue to contribute positively o GDP. Expenditure on a moderate increase in employmen in he public sector is likely o sup­ por growth in 2024 and 2025, while social benefits in kind, particularly in he areas of health and care services, will prob­ ably be expanded hroughou he forecas period. German foreign rade is no expected o noticeably increase again until 2025. Supported by falling interes rates world­ wide and a gradual upturn in investmen activity abroad, demand for German industrial goods should rekindle. However, German goods exports are unlikely o expand as dynamically as in he pas due o strong competition from China. As a result, he share of services of otal exports should increase further over he forecas horizon. Goods imports will likely benefi from he recovery of he expor business and he improvemen in German industrial production and pick up. As German exports of industrial and capital goods should be somewha weaker, goods imports will probably exceed exports in relative erms. This results in a slightly negative rade balance for he German economy in both 2025 and 2026 (Table 4). Rising foreign demand should boos private equipmen investmen again from he second half of 2025.

However, considerable catch-up effects are no expected over he forecas period, as he recovery of he industrial sector will likely be slow. The pub­ lic sector will continue o suppor equipmen investment, in particular with he special fund for he German armed forces (Sondervermögen Bundeswehr), which should lead o a significan increase in public spending. Construction investments will no pick up until he second half of 2025, when construction costs will gradually stabilize. This is decisive for residential construction in particular, which should no pick up until 2026. In contrast, investmen in non-residential construction is likely o expand continu­ ously, with civil engineering in particular continuing o drive he positive rend. Despite falling interes rates, monetary policy will initially remain restrictive and is no expected o reach he range of Box 2 Impac of fiscal policy measures on private consumption and GDP Fiscal policy measures in 2024 and 2025 will be restrictive overall and are expected o contrac by 0.7 and 0.4 percen of GDP year- on-year. In 2026, fiscal policy will become neutral again. In accord­ ance with fiscal policy assumptions, he majority of he Federal Government's growth initiative measures are no considered here. The majority of fiscal measures affec private households. A DSGE model with wo differen household ypes (TANK model) is used o estimate he stimulating effec of private consumption and GDP while accounting for heir distributional effects. To his end, a dis­ tinction is firs made between he exten o which he measures affec he lowest-income 40 percen of households and how he remaining households benefi or are negatively affected. The 40 percen with he lowes incomes earn around 20 percen of total disposable income and have a savings rate of zero, which is why hey are referred o as liquidity-constrained (LC) households. In addition o private households, here are he measures ha af­ fec companies or he Federal Government. Fiscal policy measures are divided into six categories according o heir impac on he wo household ypes and other actors: 1. Measures ha affec LC households only 2.",
    "Measures ha affec all households per capita 3. Measures ha affec all households proportionally o their income 4. Measures ha affec high-income households only 5. Measures ha affec companies (differentiated by effec on profits and subsidies) 6. Measures ha affec he government Since he wo household ypes differ in heir consumption behav­ ior, he consumption effec will be highes for low-income house­ holds in particular and decline over he other hree categories. Some of he measures ha will relieve low-income households in particular are he basic income (Bürgergeld) and housing bene­ fits (Wohngeld) reforms in 2024 and he introduction of he basic child benefi in 2025. Moreover, he change o he basic pension from 2024 should suppor low-income households. High-income households are likely o benefi from he Inflationsausgleichgesetz (Inflation Adjustmen Act) and, in particular, from he correspond­ ing income ax rate adjustments, especially in 2024, bu also in 2025 and 2026. The measures ha burden both household ypes per capita in­ clude, above all, he expiry of he ax exemption for he inflation compensation premium, bu also he expiry of he electricity and gas price brakes. Additional burdens proportional o private house­ hold income come from increasing he health and long-term care insurances. Higher-income households will be burdened by he expiry of he environmental bonus for electric vehicles and of he fourth Coronavirus Tax Relief Act, as well as by cuts o parental allowance (Elterngeld) for op earners. Companies will be subjec to various kinds of sales ax cuts and he gas and electricity price brake will end. Overall, fiscal policy measures will lower he income of private households by 0.04 percen in relation o GDP compared o he base year of 2022 in 2024 and by 0.01 in both 2025 and 2026 (Table). The measures will dampen private consumption by 0.3 in 2024 and by 0.4 in both 2025 and 2026, primarily due o he de­ cline in consumption among low-income households. Investmen will fall by 0.4 percen in 2024 and by 0.5 and by 0.6 percen in 2025 and 2026, respectively, as companies in particular are reduc­ ing heir investmen activity. Overall, restrictive fiscal stimuli will have a negative impac of 0.06 and 0.05 percen on GDP in 2025 and 2026.

In 2026, he restrictive fiscal measures (increasing emissions trading revenue, increasing social security contributions) are likely o be on par with he expansive fiscal policy effects, for",
    "example hrough further income ax cuts and he exten­ sion of degressive depreciation rules. Of he 49 measures from he German Federal Government’s recently announced growth initiative, his forecas only includes he Tax Reform Ac (Steuerfortentwicklungsgesetz), for which a cabine deci­ sion has already been made. As i is expected ha he meas­ ures will only gradually be implemented over he nex wo years, he growth effec is likely o be positive, bu small.7 7 Cf.

However, i is likely o have a negative effec on GDP in 2025 and 2026, with he greates burden being placed on low-income households (Box 2). In 2024, his is primarily due o he expiry of measures ha were initi­ ated o mitigate he energy crisis, as well as consolidation measures, such as cuts o he Climate and Transformation Fund (Klima- und Transformationsfonds). There will be hus fewer expansive stimuli from he Growth Opportunities Ac (Wachstumschancengesetz) as well as fewer adjustments to he income ax rate (Box 3). In 2025, restrictive meas­ ures, such as he end of he ax-free inflation compensa­ tion premium as well as further consolidation measures 6 The rate of neutral interes can only be estimated, no observed. According o estimates by the European Central Bank, he nominal rate of neutral interes is between 1.25 and 2.7 percen if a two-percen inflation premium is added o he estimates of he real natural interes rate. Cf. Claus Brand, Noëmie Lisack, and Falk Mazelis, “Estimates of he natural interes rate for he euro area: an update,” ECB Economic Bulletin no. 1 (2024): 66–69. Box 3 Fiscal policy measure assumptions Expansive fiscal policy measures ha were implemented during the energy crisis and are now expiring are being followed by less comprehensive new programs. Thus, here will be a considerable negative fiscal stimulus (Table) his year. The expiry of he electricity and gas price brakes as well as he end of aid for hospitals and care facilities as a par of he energy crisis has he greates impact. On he expenditure side, his is offse by additional expenditure from he Climate and Transformation Fund (Klima- und Transformationsfonds, KTF) (promoting energy effi­ ciency in he building sector, subsidies for constructing refueling and charging infrastructure and he end of he EEG surcharge for consumers) as well as expenditure from he special fund for the Bundeswehr and suppor for Ukraine. These are significan in themselves, bu quantitatively smaller han he spending cuts. On he income side of he government, he increase in he carbon price and he ruck oll as well as he increase in he air raffic",
    "ax will resul in more revenue for local authorities. A restrictive effec also comes from he income side of social insurance. The increase in he contribution rate for statutory long-term care insurance on July 1, 2023, still has an impac his year. Moreover, i is assumed ha he state health insurance providers will slightly increase heir supple­ mental premium on average compared o 2023. As i is assumed tha he ax-free inflation compensation premium will accoun for a smaller share of wage increases in 2024 compared o 2023, his will also have a restrictive effec on household labor income. Overall, fiscal policy is likely o have a dampening effec on economic activity this year with growth of 0.7 percen in relation o GDP. Fiscal policy measures will be restrictive overall in 2025, oo, as ax and duty increases will predominate on he income side and cuts will have a greater impac han spending increases on he expend­ iture side. Overall, he budge impac of fiscal policy measures is likely o amoun o 0.4 percen of economic outpu in 2025. The expiry of he inflation compensation premium, a further in­ crease in he carbon price, and any increases in social security contribution rates resul in higher revenue increases on he income side han adjustments o he income ax rate as par of he elimina­ tion of bracke creep and ax breaks from he Growth Opportunities Ac (Wachstumschancengesetz) will reduce governmen revenue. On he expenditure side, he introduction of he basic child security, a further increase o he child benefit, he measures included in he Long-Term Care Suppor and Relief Ac (Pflegeunterstützungs- und Entlastungsgesetz), and further additional expenditure on defense will likely provide stimulating effects. In contrast, cuts o suppor o Ukraine as well as o he KTF mean ha overall expenditure will be lower han in 2024 and hus have a restrictive fiscal effect. In 2026, fiscal policy measures will balance each other out, result­ ing in an effec of zero in relation o GDP. Primarily adjustments o the income ax rates, such as he elimination of bracke creep, will lead o a reduction in governmen revenue, which in urn increases the income of private households and hus has an expansionary effect. The collective depreciation reform as well as he extension of he degressive depreciation for assets also contribute o he expansive nature of he income side. Conversely, social security contributions are expected o be raised further and revenue from fuel emissions rading should continue o suppor he general gov­ ernmen budget. On he expenditure side, investments within he scope of he special fund for he Bundeswehr in particular will have an impact. However, he effec will be dampened by further consol­ idation measures in he KTF. 235 DIW Weekly Repor 35–39/2024 DIW BERLIN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK Table Fiscal measures: General governmen budge burdens (−) and relief (+) In billions of euros (compared o previous year) 2024 2025 2026 Local governmen revenue Annual Tax Ac 2022 0.2 1.0 −1.1 Inflation Adjustmen Ac",

    "2024 236 DIW Weekly Repor 35–39/2024 DIW BERLIN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK Overall, governmen deficits are expected o decrease slightly over he forecas period, falling from 2.6 percen in relation to GDP in 2024 o 2.3 percen in 2025 and further o 1.7 per­ cen in 2026 (Figure 6). All in all, price-adjusted GDP will likely stagnate in 2024. Economic outpu is expected o grow by 0.9 percen in 2025 and by 1.4 percen in 2026. Thus, DIW Berlin is lowering its forecas for 2024 by 0.3 percentage points and for 2025 by 0.4 percentage points compared o he summer forecast. The forecas was revised downward primarily due o a revi­ sion of he reported data and he significantly weaker indica­ tors for he German and global economy over he summer. Due o ongoing weak investmen and declining labor force potential, potential GDP is likely o continue o develop slug­ gishly until he end of 2029. The labor volume in particu­ lar will decline as a resul of he aging population. In ligh of he stagnation his year, he outpu gap is likely o grow and amoun o -1.9 percen of potential GDP on average for 2024. With he recovery over he coming years, he outpu gap should hen shrink o -0.6 percen a he end of he shor term and close in 2029. Average consumer price inflation should be 2.2 percen in 2024. In 2025 and 2026, i will likely level off a he ECB's two-percen inflation arget. Thus, he inflation expectation for 2024 is slightly lower compared o summer, while i remains unchanged for 2025. The core rate, inflation exclud­ ing energy and food, is expected o average hree percen in 2024 due o continuous strong price increases for services. I will also reach he wo-percen arge over he course of the forecast. In addition o he global risks ha are creating uncertainty for the outlook of he German economy, here are also domes­ tic risk factors. Above all, his includes political uncertainty, which is currently close o its all-time high according o he Economic Policy Uncertainty Index. Although he German Federal Governmen was recently able o agree on a draf budge for 2025, here are still concerns ha he coalition parties—which are pursuing differen objectives in many areas—are o a certain exten unable o ake action. This makes for an unclear economic policy framework, which could more negatively impac he domestic economy han assumed in his forecast. The recen results of he state elections in Thuringia and Saxony and he rise of he populis forces here also pose an additional risk. These results could increase he skilled worker shortage and reduce Germany’s a ractiveness as an economic location. In addition, right-wing and left-wing populis parties could perform well in he upcoming 2025 Bundestag elections and increase uncertainty with regard o he subsequen forma­ tion of a government.
