    "SUPPLY Sanctions agains Russian gas would no endanger EU or German gas supply By Franziska Holz, Lukas Barner, Claudia Kemfert, and Christian von Hirschhausen ABSTRACT As a resul of he Russian a ack on Ukraine, natural gas prices skyrocketed in 2022 and Germany in particular fel he impac of its strong dependency on Russia. Prices have since relaxed, the European natural gas industry has overcome he uncer­ tainty due o he energy crisis in 2022, and he industry also survived he slump in Russian natural gas imports withou sup­ ply interruptions. However, Russia continues o expor lique­ fied natural gas (LNG) o Europe and still has some countries in Central and Eastern Europe under control in erms of energy policy, which has so far prevented EU sanctions on Russian natural gas exports. Both he German and European natural gas supplies would be secure in he long erm withou Russian imports, as shown by model calculations using he Global Gas Model which depicts he global natural gas industry in grea detail. Security of supply is, hus, no standing in he way of further EU sanctions agains Russia. Increased efforts o save energy and a imely natural gas phase-ou would reduce dependency on gas imports, which will also contribute o climate change mitigation. Russian natural gas exports o he European Union have reduced drastically over he course of he Russo-Ukrainian War. As a result, here have been concerns in he EU ha Russian imports could no be adequately replaced. Member States were herefore no able o agree on sanctions agains Russian natural gas, unlike for coal and pipeline-based oil exports. The EU is currently considering a new push for gas sanctions agains Russia ha are directed agains he transshipmen of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) in European ports. As he gas ransi agreemen between Russia and Ukraine will expire a he end of 2024 and he Russo-Ukrainian war is still ongoing, a complete stop of all Russian imports o he EU is conceivable. In contrast, i is less likely ha international relations will recover and ha he volume of Russian gas imports will increase again. Therefore, his Weekly Repor uses a model o analyze he effects of various scenarios on the European natural gas supply. The analysis also consid­ ers differentiated developments regarding he global natu­ ral gas supply and demand ha could occur depending on various climate policy scenarios. A disruption of Russian natural gas imports is a scenario tha has been frequently analyzed, even before he Russo- Ukrainian War.1 Theoretically, a reduction of supplies can be compensated for in hree ways. First, Russian imports could be replaced by imports from other sources; second, demand can be reduced and energy can be saved; and hird, infra­ structure bo lenecks can be eliminated, for example hrough more efficien pipeline management. These measures are reflected in he political strategies from 2022, such as in he RePowerEU package.2 1 Cf. for example Hella Engerer e al. “European Natural Gas Supply Secure Despite Political Crises”",

The opic has been discussed ever since, cf. for example Nikita Moskalenko e al., “Europe’s independence from Russian natural gas — Effects of impor restrictions on energy system development,” Energy Reports 11 (2014): 2853–2866 (available online). 2 European Commission, REPowerEU-Plan (2022) (available online). 151 DIW Weekly Repor 21/2024 NATURAL GAS SUPPLY EU countries were able o quickly compensate for lower Russian exports in 2022 As a resul of he ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War, Russia interrupted its supply of natural gas o pipelines exporting directly o Germany and Poland. Nevertheless, Russia is cur­ rently still supplying numerous EU Member States, both via Türkiye as well as via LNG and, paradoxically, via Ukraine (Box 1). For example, as of winter 2023–2024, more han 95 percen of Austria’s gas imports are from Russia.3 The ongoing dependency of Central and Eastern EU Member States on Russia is an importan reason ha he EU did no sanction Russian natural gas exports. In each of he firs wo quarters of 2021—before he Russo- Ukrainian War began—the EU purchased over 40 billion cubic meters of natural gas from Russia, which corresponded to over 45 percen of he EU’s otal gas imports. In he same period in 2023, his amoun was reduced o 10.5 billion cubic meters per quarter. Of hat, hree billion cubic meters were delivered via Ukraine and around 2.5 billion cubic meters via Türkiye. Moreover, around five billion cubic meters of Russian LNG are imported each quarter.4 However, he gas ransi agreemen between Russia and Ukraine will end on December 31, 2024. A he same ime, i is unlikely ha he Nord Stream and Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea pipelines will be recommissioned in he near future due to he ongoing war and physical damage o he pipelines as a resul of explosions in September 2022. Overall, his leads to he question of whether Europe would have a sufficien supply withou Russian natural gas via Ukraine and Türkiye and LNG imports. Developmen of European natural gas markets depending on supply and demand This Weekly Repor uses he Global Gas Model (GGM), which has been used in research and policy advice for many years (Box 2), o analyze he medium and long-term European natural gas supply. For Europe, he effects of global climate policy rends in particular are decisive for global natural gas production and demand as well as geopolitical developments related o Russia. Therefore, wo global climate action sce- narios on he demand side are combined with hree scenarios for Russian exports on he supply side. Scenarios for he developmen of EU gas demand and Russian supply limitations The differen climate policy ambitions are depicted in wo exemplary scenarios. In he firs scenario, which could",
    "be considered our reference scenario, global natural gas demand is reduced rapidly until 2050, as would be expected with 3 Bundesministerium für Klimaschutz, Umwelt, Energie, Mobilität, Innovation und Technologie, Österreichs Energie-Infoportal (2024) (in German; available online). 4 Cf. he data in Ben McWilliams e al, European Natural Gas Imports (Bruegel Datasets) ( available online), which has been continuously updated since June 2022. ambitious climate policy (scenario with rapidly declining natural gas demand). In he second scenario, natural gas demand is reduced a a delayed pace until i falls o zero in 2050 (scenario with slowly declining natural gas demand). This would be conceivable if, for example, natural gas firs had o compensate for he missing power generation from closing nuclear power plants. In his scenario, natural gas demand in he EU remains a a constan level until he 2030s. Simultaneously, here is a marked decline in European natu­ ral gas production. Thus, his scenario has he highes impor dependency in he nex years (Figure 1).5 5 Other scenarios are conceivable, such as hose in which a complete natural gas phase-ou is no achieved by 2050. Two scenarios were defined ha do no mee he requirements of he Paris Agreement. In he Moderate Climate Ambition scenario, global natural gas demand de­ clines and here are moderately improved climate action ambitions in Europe. In he No Climate Ambition scenario, in contrast, here is unlimited use of natural gas withou climate action. Both scenarios resul in lower medium-term impor demand in Europe han he scenario with slowly decreasing demand described in his Weekly Report. Cf. he data specifications of hese scenarios (available online). Figure 1 Developmen of global natural gas demand until 2050 by climate action scenario In billion cubic meters per year Source: Authors’ calculations. © DIW Berlin 2024 The curren global natural gas demand of 3,800 billion cubic meters falls o zero by 2050 in both scenarios. 152 DIW Weekly Repor 21/2024 NATURAL GAS SUPPLY Both demand scenarios are combined with differen assump­ tions abou he availability of Russian natural gas in Europe: The New Normal Scenario roughly corresponds o he cur­ ren situation as of 2024, with partially available capacities via Ukraine and Türkiye as well as unlimited imports of Russian LNG. This is compared o a scenario with a complete stop of Russian imports o Europe (Sanctions Scenario) and o a scenario assuming large volumes of imports from Russia (Pre-War Scenario). The las scenario is somewha differ­ en from he situation before 2022 because i includes he increased diversification efforts of European imports com­ pared o he 2010s. Russian natural gas could be replaced in he entire EU I became clear in 2022 ha Russian natural gas could be largely replaced by a combination of imports from other sources and a decline in demand. However, Central and Eastern European countries are still purchasing Russian pipeline gas and LNG. As he New Normal Scenario shows, i is possible o continue his impor strategy in he shor term, both with rapidly",
    "declining demand (Figure 2, op) as well as delayed declining demand (Figure 3, op). The share of Russian gas would fall o around en o 15 percen of he European natural gas supply in he long run. The model calculations show ha completely foregoing Russian natural gas (Sanctions Scenario) would be possible for he EU and would require demand o decline only slightly. This is made possible as a resul of sufficien available impor capacities and ample natural gas volumes on he global mar­ ke (Figure 2, center).6 In his case, more LNG would be 6 The prices calculated in he model increase only moderately in he EU Member States ( approx. ten percent). However, i mus be noted ha equilibrium prices are calculated, which do no in­ clude factors such as uncertainty and short-term adjustments. However, such factors caused he enormous price increase in 2022 o, a imes, almos en imes he pre-war price. Box 1 The history of natural gas and geopolitics Natural gas has been a significan par of he European energy system since he 1970s. Since hen, geopolitics has played a cen­ tral role in issues such as price se ing and security of supply. To secure he supply of Germany and other European countries, long- term contracts have been concluded with governments, such as one with he Netherlands in he 1970s and one with Norway in he 1980s.1 As natural gas markets became globalized hrough he de­ velopmen of LNG ransport, hese agreements were expanded o other continents. As of 2024, he global LNG marke is dominated by American, Australian, and Qatari suppliers. Natural gas delivered via pipeline from he Sovie Union was par of he Western European energy mix even during he Cold War. However, i has been viewed critically by he USA from he begin­ ning.2 While he USA’s embargo hreats in he 1960s still blocked rapprochement, some Western European countries and he Sovie Union concluded long-term contracts from he early 1970s on­ ward ha established he delivery and financing of pipelines by Germany in exchange for he Sovie natural gas supplies. Up until he 1990s, he Member States of he curren EU obtained Sovie natural gas almos exclusively via Ukraine. Back hen, his pipeline system had a capacity of nearly 150 billion cubic meters per year, more han one hird of he curren natural gas con­ sumption in he EU.3 Following he collapse of he Sovie Union, 1 Anne Neumann, Sophia Rüster, and Christian von Hirschhausen, “Long-Term Contracts in he Natural Gas Industry – Literature Survey and Data on 426 Contracts (1965–2014),” DIW Data Docu­ mentation no. 77 (2015) (available online). 2 For more on his, see O o Wolff von Amerongen, Der Weg nach Osten: Vierzig Jahre Brücken­ bau für die deutsche Wirtschaf (Munich: Droemer Knaur, 1992): 208ff (in German). 3 However, due o a lack of pipeline maintenance and he decommissioning of individual border-crossing points, his capacity has declined in he pas decades. Russia diversified its expor routes, primarily o",
    "avoid geostrategic dependencies on he newly independen Ukraine.4 This diversification began in he 1990s with he construction of the Yamal–Europe pipeline via Belarus and Poland and continued in he late 2000s with he firs Nord Stream projec hrough he Baltic Sea.5 Since 2011, Germany and parts of Western and Eastern Europe have been supplied via he Nord Stream pipeline, which had a capacity of 55 billion cubic meters per year.6 From he outset, Nord Stream 2 also served o bypass Ukraine as a transi country withou being necessary for he energy sector.7 This also became clear in he ransi agreemen concluded between Russia and Ukraine in 2019. This agreemen prescribes he ransi of only 65 billion cubic meters in 2020 and 40 billion cubic meters each year in 2021 hrough 2024. Recently, Russian expor possibilities o Europe were further diver­ sified by opening up he route via Türkiye as well as by building up substantial liquefaction capacities. A he same ime, he sales of pipeline gas were diversified with he construction of he firs pipe­ lines connecting o China. 4 Cf.

Even in a sce­ nario in which natural gas demand in he EU remains con­ sistently high until 2030, a complete supply stop of Russian natural gas o he EU would be possible (Figure 3, center). In he Pre-War Scenario, in which a greater volume of Russian imports becomes available again in he EU, Russia would expor more natural gas o Europe in a scenario with initially stable and high demand (Figure 3, bo om) han in the scenario with rapidly declining demand (Figure 2, bot­ tom). However, due o greater diversification, Russia would no be as dominan as supplier as i was before he war. Norway became he EU’s mos importan natural gas sup­ plier in 2022 and will remain so in he alternative scenarios and in he nex decades. The share of EU imports coming from Norway will depend on he role of Russia, especially in the coming years. In he longer erm, he exten of climate action will determine he volume of Norwegian imports, which is lower in he rapid phase-ou scenario compared o the scenario with a",
    "slow decline in demand. The medium and long-term natural gas strategy is controversial in Norway, as deposits north of he Arctic Circle mus be exploited o maintain he curren annual production capacity of over 100 billion cubic meters. Due o its proximity o he EU and privileged political relations, Norway can also supply more than 50 billion cubic meters per year o he EU in he 2030s and retain an importan role until Europe phases ou natu­ ral gas use completely. Curren LNG impor erminal construction plans are oo large, even with high demand until 2030 LNG became a larger share of European imports han in previous years relatively quickly in 2022 in order o compen­ sate for he decline in Russian natural gas. This was possible because, on he one hand, a significan amoun of unused LNG impor capacity was available along he European coasts. On he other hand, LNG supply and global liquefication capac­ ities have increased since 2016, with he entry of he USA and Russia into he LNG rade being particularly significant. Accordingly, LNG imports play a larger role in he model results han hey did in he 2010s (Figure 4). In he New Normal and Sanctions Scenarios, other pipeline imports, especially from Norway, North Africa, and he Caspian Sea region, can only partially compensate for he marked decline in pipeline imports from Russa. The share of LNG of otal imports increases primarily in he scenario with a slow decline in demand ha assumes contin­ uously high consumption until he beginning of he 2030s with lower EU production. A its peak, up o 167 billion cubic meters of LNG would be imported o he EU in his sce­ nario, which would be nearly 50 percen of otal gas imports. In almos all combined scenarios, however, hese LNG imports could be realized withou requiring he LNG ermi­ nal expansions currently being planned, which shall increase capacity in he EU o well over 200 billion cubic meters per year.7 A small expansion of LNG impor capacities, namely in Croatia and Italy, would be necessary only in he scenario with high demand and a complete end of Russian imports. The existing capacities in continental Northwestern Europe would be used with higher capacity utilization rates han they have been in pas years, especially in he New Normal and Sanctions Scenarios with a low volume of imports and no imports from Russia, respectively. In he scenario where demand declines immediately, he EU would require a mos 127 billion cubic meters of LNG imports if here were no Russian imports. 7 Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, European LNG Tracker (2024) ( available online).

The model calculations show ha these countries could also compensate for a complete end of Russian imports (Figure 5). LNG imports from he USA and Qatar would play a particularly importan role, as would nat­ ural gas delivered via pipelines from Norway and he Caspian Sea region (for example Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan). For some countries, domestic gas production continues o be important, especially for Romania. Europe has an extensive pipeline network which enables importers in countries withou LNG ports o purchase LNG from he world markets. Germany, for example, imported LNG withou its own erminals via harbors in Belgium and the Netherlands. However, he large LNG impor capacities of he Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal, with a otal of over 60 billion cubic meters of impor capacity) are cu off from he res of Europe due o limited pipeline capacities between Spain and France.8 8 The problem of low cross-border capacity between Spain and France has been known for many years, cf. for example Engerer e al., “European Natural Gas Supply Secure Despite Political Crises.” There were brief political efforts o agree on an expansion during he energy crisis in 2022, bu nothing came o fruition.

In he shor erm, he expor possibilities are limited o LNG and the Power of Siberia pipeline running o China. I can be assumed ha pipeline capacities can be expanded in he medium and long erm. Russian gas exports have been increasingly oriented owards Asia for some ime now, regardless of he geopolitical situ­ ation.9 This is he resul of both growing demand in Asia as well as overall demand shrinking in Europe. However, China has a lower willingness o pay han previ­ ous European importers, meaning a decline in Russia’s",
    "reve­ nue can be expected. Russia also obtains low prices (because they are se by he government) with he volumes ha have shifted o he domestic market. Efficien infrastructure utilization is a cost- effective option for improving security of supply In addition o diversifying natural gas imports and reduc­ ing demand, more efficien use of existing natural gas infra­ structure can also contribute o further easing he situa­ tion in Europe. Up until now, his infrastructure has no been used efficiently, especially in cross-border gas rade. In this case, he commercial pipeline capacities are negotiated bilaterally, meaning i may no be possible o use he entire available infrastructure. Also within some Member States, he curren congestion managemen scheme, he entry-exi system, prevents full infrastructure utilization and creates artificial scarcity.10 With efficien use, in contrast, cross-operator optimization would be possible, as has long been he practice in he electricity sector in he USA.11 Inefficien network managemen in the natural gas industry has been criticized since he mar­ ket’s liberalization in Europe in 1998, bu has still no been resolved despite gradual progress.12 9 Franziska Holz, Philipp M. Richter, and Ruud Egging, “A Global Perspective on he Future of Natural Gas: Resources, Trade, and Climate Constraints,” Review of Environmental Economics and Policy 9, no. 1 (2015): 85–106. 10 10 In he entry-exi system, he gas supplier mus purchase network capacity on a piecemeal basis, which can be restricted relatively freely by he individual network operators. 11 See Fred C. Schweppe e al., Spo Pricing of Electricity (Boston, USA: Kluwer, 1988); as well as William W. Hogan, “Contrac Networks for Electric Power Transmission,” Journal of Regulatory Economics 4, no. 3 (1992): 211–242 (available online). 12 For more on his, see Christian von Hirschhausen, “Infrastructure, Regulation, Investmen and Security of Supply: A Case Study of he Restructured US Natural Gas Market,” Utilities Policy 16, no. 1 (2008): 1–10 (available online); as well as Jeff D. Makholm, The Political Economy of Pipelines: A Century of Comparative Institutional Developmen (The University of Chicago Press, 2012). Conclusion: Natural gas phase-ou is the bes instrumen for avoiding future impor dependency Overall, he German and European energy industries sur­ vived he loss of Russian pipeline exports withou major dis­ ruptions. Energy savings efforts, diversifying suppliers, and flexible network managemen have offse he bo lenecks. The wholesale prices of natural gas have declined sharply since September 2022, supply disruptions have no occurred, and he “crisis” in he natural gas industry has been over since a leas spring 2023. However, he EU is still purchasing gas from Russia via pipe­ line and as LNG. The issue of gas sanctions agains Russia is no off he able in view of he ongoing war in Ukraine. Currently, he EU is considering sanctions agains Russian LNG. Thus, he European Commission wants o ban he use of European harbors for he onward shipmen of Russian LNG o hird countries, which is currently happening, for example in Zeebrugge (Belgium). Box 2 Global Gas Model The Global",
    "Gas Model was developed by researchers a he Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) and DIW Berlin and has been regularly updated for over en years.1 The model depicts all relevan actors in he natural gas industry: natural gas producers, natural gas raders, LNG ex­ por erminals (liquefaction), LNG ships, LNG impor erminals (regasification), pipeline operators, storage operators, and a final demand comprised of differen sectors. Costs, capacity assumptions, and assumptions abou he costs of expanding infrastructure capacities are included in he model for each actor and each country. The model distinguishes between 136 regions (nodes) ha are connected o each other via pipeline or LNG ranspor routes. In he model calculations, both he curren impor and ranspor capacities as well as the possibility of expanding pipeline or harbor capacities are considered. Natural gas suppliers can exercise marke pow­ er, especially Russia, he USA, Qatar, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Algeria. The model calculations are performed a five-year steps until 2060. Assumptions mus be made abou future demand and production volumes in all countries ha are needed o parameterize he demand and supply functions. For the results presented in his Weekly Report, he model data were updated and he star year was se o 2020 in order o be able o calculate investments for he firs observation year (2025). Furthermore, an updated and open-source version is now available.2 1 Ruud Egging and Franziska Holz, “Global Gas Model: Model and Data Documentation v3.0 (2019),” DIW Data Documentation no. 100 (2019) (available online). 2 The model code and data are available online. 156 DIW Weekly Repor 21/2024 NATURAL GAS SUPPLY Model calculations show ha he EU can maintain a suffi­ cien supply of natural gas withou Russian imports even if demand remains a oday’s level. In he shor erm, addi­ tional deliveries from Norway and LNG imports a existing impor erminals are contributing o diversification. In he medium and long erm, he European energy sector is head­ ing o a natural gas phase-out. The rapid switch o renew­ able energy sources can significantly contribute o reduc­ ing impor dependencies and, hus, he supposed risk of some European countries o be blackmailed. Hence, secu­ rity of supply is no reason for he EU o no sanction Russian gas imports. European natural gas infrastructure, such as pipelines, LNG terminals, and compressor stations, has been significantly expanded since he 2005–2006 Russia–Ukraine gas dispute and only requires minor expansion, even with moderate cli­ mate action and continued high natural gas demand. In par­ ticular, he currently planned expansion of European LNG capacities seems o be oo extensive. Efficien use of exist­ ing pipeline capacities, in contrast, strengthens security of supply and keeps costs low.
