An analysis of 321 sovereign deb restructur­ ings since 1815 shows ha foreign private and institutional investor losses were 43 percen on average. Notably, begin­ ning in he 1970s, several deb exchanges have increasingly been",
    "required o resolve a default. To understand his new phenomenon be er, his Weekly Repor looks a otal creditor losses across all restructurings during a defaul spell. Instead of focusing on each individual restructuring, he cumula­ tive haircu adds up all losses across a defaul spell. These calculations show ha deb crises with serial restructurings resulted in greater overall losses for creditors han a major one-off restructuring. The results conclude ha i makes sense to perform a deb sustainability analysis independently and in a imely manner when determining he size of a haircut. This could lessen deb restructurings with shallow haircuts ha do no manage o bring countries back o heir sustainable deb path. Defaults end o be painful for debtors and creditors alike. Sovereign debtors may lose access o he international cap­ ital market, fall into a protracted recession, or suffer from social upheavals, while private and institutional creditors gen­ erally mus accep losses in heir portfolios sooner or later. There has still been comparatively li le research on he mag­ nitude of a deb crisis on debtors and creditors. Unlike other crises, such as currency crashes, inflation, or banking cri­ ses, deb crises are generally characterized in a binary man­ ner, i.e., did a crisis occur or not, irrespective of whether he crisis was resolved with minor or otal losses for investors. Moving beyond a simple characterization of sovereign deb crises, his Weekly Repor examines he history of defaults since 1815 using a comprehensive dataset.1 I focuses on he amoun los by creditors, also known as haircuts.2 Moreover, this Weekly Repor akes a closer look a he new phenom­ enon of serial restructurings and its relationship o he size of creditor losses.3 Serial restructurings should no be con­ fused with serial default. Usually, serial restructurings occur within a single defaul spell when he earlier restructuring deals do no provide enough deb reduction o place he coun­ try on a sustainable deb path.4 A defaul spell is considered final when no further defaults occur within wo years after the las default. 1 This Weekly Repor is based on a paper for he 24th Jacques Polak Annual Research Confer­ ence of he International Monetary Fund. Cf. Clemens Graf von Luckner, Josefin Meyer, Carmen M. Reinhar und Christoph Trebesch, “Sovereign Debt: 200 years of creditor losses,” Mimeo, 2023 (available online. Accessed on January 22, 2024. This applies o all other online sources in his re­ por unless otherwise noted). 2 The data are based on work by Juan J. Cruces and Christoph Trebesch, “Sovereign Defaults: The Price of Haircuts,” American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics 5, no. 3 (2013): 85-117; Josefin Meyer, Carmen M. Reinhart, and Christoph Trebesch, “Soverign Bonds Since Waterloo,” The Quarterly Journal of Economics 137, no. 3 (2022): 1615-1680. The analysis follows in he radition of Carmen M. Reinhar and Kenneth Rogoff, “The Aftermath of Financial Crises,” American Economic Review 99, no. 2 (2009): 466-472. 3 The paper his Weekly Repor is based on also investigates how much creditors lose",
    "during deb crises ha are related o geopolitical shocks (wars, revolutions, empires breaking up), major external debt, or low per capita income of debtor countries, cf. Graf von Luckner e al., “Sovereign Debt.” 4 The erm “serial restructuring” refers o wo or more deb exchanges within a single defaul spell, cf. Carmen M. Reinhart, Kenneth S. Rogoff, and Miguel A. Savastano, “Deb Intolerance,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, no. 23, 1 (2003) (available online). 47 DIW Weekly Repor 6/2024 SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISES 321 restructurings over he pas 200 years The analysis considers he period from 1815 o 2020 and includes 200 defaul spells of countries on external deb instruments with a otal of 321 deb restructurings (Figure 1). These instruments are held by private external creditors such as foreign or institutional investors like funds, insur­ ers, and commercial banks (e.g., he London Club creditor banks during he 1970s or 1980s).5 Domestic or external offi­ cial creditors are excluded. A defaul occurs when either he sovereign debtor misses deb payments beyond he grace period or when here are changes o he deb contrac ha are less favorable for he creditor, for example if an existing financial instrumen such as a governmen bond or loan is exchanged for a new one. These restructurings mostly occur in he contex or geopo­ litical or domestic political crises. In his Weekly Report, he calculation of haircuts is limited o defaults and restructurings of medium and long-term debts. Restructurings ha are solely involved with short-term debt, such as short-term credi line maintenance, 90-day deb roll­ overs, or instances of short-term maturity extension of less than a year are excluded. For cases where here are serial deb restructurings occur­ ring close ogether, hey mus be aggregated o quantify he full exten of creditor losses between he star of deb distress and when i is resolved. To do so, he Bulow-Rogoff haircu (BR) is introduced, named after Jeremy Bulow and Kenneth Rogoff (Box). Only observing individual haircuts could dis­ tor he creditor losses. However, he BR method captures the dynamic aspects of multiple deb exchanges by aggre­ gating he creditor losses. For example, during its deb cri­ sis in he 1980s, Brazil recorded six individual haircuts (from nine percen in 1983 o 29 percen in 1994). The cumulative haircu according o he BR method during his 13-year-long defaul spell was 46.6 percent. There is a large heterogeneity in he size of haircuts Average investor losses are around 43 percen per restruc­ turing. According o he BR method, his figure was as high as 47 percen for each defaul spell (Table). Over he pas 200 years, here have been around a dozen cases in which haircuts were negative. In hese cases, he ne presen value after he deb exchange was higher han before. This can happen, for example, when sovereigns extend deb maturi­ ties a higher interes rates han in he previous contrac in advance o avoid a default. Such deb restructurings are rare and almos always occur during",
    "he earlier stages of a crisis. 5 The London Club is an informal group of banks ha generally ac as creditors o emerging markets. These banks coordinate and represen heir common interests and concerns related o their loan and financial relationships o hese countries. Figure 1 Selected deb crises and restructurings worldwide from 1815 o 2020 By country in alphabetical order Notes: The selection was limited o deb crises in 46 countries. In otal, 91 countries have been affected by sovereign deb crises over he pas 200 years. A defaul spell is considered final when no further defaults have occurred within two years after he defaul has been se led.

The other extreme is a full repudiation. Ten of he deb restructurings discussed here fall into his category. Mostly, these extreme cases are related o geopolitical urbulence or revolutions in which legislative or executive authorities declare he defaulted deb as illegitimate, such as happened after he Russian revolution in 1917 or after he Chinese defaul in 1949. Serial restructurings are increasingly common Defaults often require multiple rounds of deb restructur­ ing until hey are se led. On average, 1.6 restructurings are needed o se le a default, with some cases requiring as many as seven distinc restructurings (Figure 2). More han one third of he 200 defaul spells covered required wo or more restructurings o cure he default. When observing he entire history of defaults and deb restructurings, serial restructurings have become more importan in pas decades (Figure 3). This could be due o the changes in institutional and contractual frameworks. For example, he introduction of collective action clauses could have improved restructuring coordination.6 The increase in interim restructurings is accompanied by shorter defaul spells (bo om of Figure 3). In he 19th century during he long nation-building process in Latin America and Europe, defaults often stretched ou over decades, such as in he case of Greece from 1824 o 1878. These defaults were delayed by events such as border wars, internal revolu­ tions, and disarray.7 In he later 19th century and early 20th century, political conditions stabilized. A he same ime, defaul spells also became shorter. Defaul spells became even shorter in he beginning of he 1970s. A he same ime, multilateral institutions increased their involvemen in emerging markets and developing coun­ tries. However, defaults now ypically involve more interim restructuring deals, which often see low haircuts (Figure 3).8 Whether shorter defaul spells with multiple restructurings are associated with fewer creditor losses will be investigated in he following section. 6 Collective action clauses (CACs) are contractual conditions",
    "of bonds (deb securities) ha enable a majority of creditors o change he conditions of deb securities, even if no all creditors agree. CACs are often used in international bonds or bonds of emerging markets. 7 Miguel Angel Centeno, Blood and debt: War and he nation-state in Latin America (Penn State Press: 2002). 8 For a historical perspective on he changing mission of he International Monetary Fund, cf.

To calculate he ne presen value (NPV) haircu Hi, for a restructuring i a ime , he ne presen value of he contractual paymen streams of he new deb issued during he restructuring is compared with he NPV of he old deb in default, accounting for arrears and cash payments. The new financial instruments such as governmen bonds or loans differ from he old ones ypically in either one or in all hree dimen­ sions: he interes rate, maturity, and face value of he obligation. This metric accounts for he characteristics of both old and new deb as well as any changes in maturity and interes structure. The haircu calculated compares he presen value of he new and he old deb in a hypothetical scenario in which he country continues to pay any remaining outstanding “old” debts as if no defaul had occurred with wha he country mus pay with",
    "he newly issued debt. Both paymen streams are discounted using he same inter­ es rate.1 For cases in which here is more han one deb restructuring, hair­ cuts mus be aggregated over he multiple restructurings with he aim of quantifying he full creditor losses between he star of deb distress and when i is finally resolved. 1 Data on restructuring and haircuts for 1815 o 1970 are from Meyer, Reinhart, and Trebesch, “Sovereign Bonds Since Waterloo;” for 1970 o 1998, Cruces und Trebesch, “Sovereign Defaults;” and for 2017 o 2022, Asonuma Toman and Christoph Trebesch, “Sovereign Deb Restructurings: Preemptive or Post-Default,” Journal of he European Economic Association 14, no. 1 (2016): 175–214 as well as Chuck Fang, Julian Schumacher, and Christoph Trebesch, “Restructuring Sovereign Bonds: Holdouts, Haircuts and he Effectiveness of CACs,” IMF Economic Review 69 (2021): 155–196 for 1999 o 2016, and Graf von Luckner e al., “Sovereign Debt.” The Bulow-Rogoff haircut2 is used o estimate he cumulative cred­ itor losses of serial deb restructurings during a single defaul spell. This cumulative metric captures he compound loss experienced by a passive investor who held a portfolio of all he securities or loans placed by he country, including hose restructured in he previous deb restructuring deals. Specifically, for he final restruc­ turing even i, he Bulow-Rogoff haircu can be computed as: where J − 1 represents he number of interim restructuring deals ha occurred before he final restructuring deal i. denotes he wealth conservation ratio in he jth restruc­ turing event. The wealth conservation ratio, or recovery rate, is defined as 1 minus he effective estimated haircu for he restruc­ turing even and is derived from deb data o private creditors a time . The BR haircu allows for a comprehensive evaluation of he long- term cumulative creditor losses due o serial restructurings. I is useful when comparing across eras with differen restructuring modalities. The BR haircu is particularly pertinen when here are numerous interim restructurings with low haircuts ha were followed by follow-up deals with deeper haircuts in he same de­ faul spell, as was he case during he 1980s in Brazil and Poland (Figure 1). Observing haircuts individually would distor creditor losses, as i gives oo much weigh o interim low-haircu deals where he share of deb covered by he exchange also ends o be much lower. I can markedly understate creditor losses during a period when serial restructurings were commonplace. The BR hair­ cu captures he dynamic aspec of serial deb exchanges, offering a unified summary of creditor losses. 2 Cf. Jeremy Bulow and Kenneth Rogoff, “A constan recontracting model of sovereign debt,” Journal of Political Economy 97, no. 1 (1989): 155–178. 50 DIW Weekly Repor 6/2024 SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISES 1998 (51 percent) compared o he previous decades (46 per­ cent) (Table). Conclusion: Deb sustainability analysis could help o find he optimal haircut Research hus far has focused on haircuts in each individual restructuring separately instead of considering he full crisis spell when calculating creditor losses. Considering",
    "he entire defaul spell, average cumulative creditor losses are signifi­ cantly higher in cases of serial restructurings. Despite serial restructurings, i is often no possible o establish a sustain­ able deb rajectory o se le he default. One possible rea­ son for his is ha restructurings were oo low or happened too late, se ing he stage for ongoing sovereign deb crisis. Other reasons can include emerging domestic and foreign political upheavals or overly optimistic economic predic­ tions.9 As defaults occur for a variety of reasons, often with 9 For a further analysis of he reasons, see Christoph Trebesch e al., “External sovereign deb restructurings: Delay and replay,” VoxEU column, March 30, 2021 (available online). Interim restructurings have smaller haircuts han final restructurings The 321 individual restructurings of he 200 defaul spells can be divided into wo groups: restructurings ha could se le a sovereign defaul (final restructurings) and restruc­ turings ha could no end he defaul spell (interim restruc­ turings). A 30 percent, interim restructurings have a signif­ icantly lower median haircu size compared o final restruc­ turings a 50 percen (Figure 4). The distribution of interim restructurings is concentrated strongly in he lower area: The majority of creditor losses from interim restructurings are between 20 o 40 percent. In comparison, final restruc­ turings have a more even distribution of haircuts across he entire spectrum of creditor losses. However, he analysis shows ha he more restructurings required, he higher he otal creditor losses (Figure 5). The firs restructuring shows haircuts with creditor losses of a bi over 40 percent, while creditors accumulate average losses of 60 percen under defaults with hree or more restructur­ ings. Cumulative creditor losses are higher on average after Figure 4 Distribution of creditor losses resulting from interim and final restructurings since 1815 In percent1 1 The green area represents he accumulation of he respective deb restructuring in the mean distribution. The black line indicates he median. Negative values arise when creditors make profits hrough crisis-related contrac adjustments. This could happen, for example, when countries extend he maturity of heir debts and, in return, accep higher interes rates han in he previous agreement.

    "se lemen based on he number of restructurings and he size of he haircuts. The results here simply show ha in many cases, he initial deb restructur­ ing erms are no enough o pu a country’s deb onto a sus­ tainable deb path. In he interests of all parties involved, debtors should no end up with more deb nor creditors with a worse portfolio due to incorrec assumptions abou deb sustainability. Thus, i is importan o determine he correc size of he haircu a the righ ime o limi creditor losses and o keep he coun­ try’s defaul spell relatively short. International institutions can help o reduce he probabil­ ity of unsustainable deb restructuring with low haircuts by providing realistic evaluations in heir deb sustainabil­ ity analyses. These should cover all ypes of deb ha pose a risk o a country’s public finances in order o, for example, recognize maturity or currency mismatches. Based on his, financing needs and potential sources of funding could be calculated and identified.
