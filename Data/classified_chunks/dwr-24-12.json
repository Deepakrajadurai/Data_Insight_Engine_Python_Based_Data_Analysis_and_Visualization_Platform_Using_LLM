In February 2024, he maximum length of his exclusion period was increased from 18 o 36 months. This increase may",
    "double he actual waiting ime, which is currently already more han one year, as data from he Socio-Economic Panel show. This particularly affects refugees with a low level of education and li le knowledge of German. A longer waiting time no only negatively impacts he health of affected individ­ uals bu is also disadvantageous for he state; late reatmen often requires more expensive reatment. Thus, shortening he period would have been more sensible han increasing it. The electronic health insurance card (EHIC) for refugees makes access o health services during his waiting period easier, as i reduces administrative barriers. However, jus under 20 per­ cen of all refugees have an EHIC, as he system has no been introduced in all federal states. The electronic health insur­ ance card should be introduced nationwide in order o cushion the negative effects of extended restrictions on health care. A he end of February 2024, he maximum period ha a refugee is excluded from health care services under he Asylbewerberleistungsgesetz (Asylum Seekers’ Benefits Act, AsylbLG) was increased from 18 o 36 months. The AsylbLG regulates he amoun and ype of social benefits asylum seek­ ers receive before hey are entitled o he citizen’s benefi (Bürgergeld) and other social benefits. According o calcu­ lations on draf legislation by he CDU/CSU Parliamentary Group,1 such an extension should resul in savings “in he three-digi million range annually.” This draf legislation was preceded by an agreemen between he federal and state gov­ ernments on a series of measures o reduce incentives for refugees o migrate o Germany as well as he costs incurred by state and local authorities, including increasing he exclu­ sion period of he AsylbLG. However, he actual effects of such a change o he AsylbLG have no been discussed in detail. In his Weekly Report, health care will be used as an example o show how increasing he AsylbLG’s exclusion period affects he health and integration of refugees as well as he financing of health care.2 The effec of introducing he electronic health insurance card (EHIC) for refugees in his legal contex is also explored. Asylum seekers, refugees with exceptional leave o remain (Geduldete), and refugees required o leave he country (Ausreisepflichtige) have limited healthcare entitlements com­ pared o social welfare recipients. By he end of February 2024, this exclusion period lasted 18 months; until September 2019, i was only 15 months. According o Section 4 of he AsylbLG, refugees are entitled o reatmen for “acute illnesses and pain,” vaccinations and medically required check-ups as well as pregnancy and birth. Further services can be pro­ vided on an individual basis according o Section 6 as long as 1 Deutscher Bundestag, “Gesetzentwurf der Fraktion CDU/CSU. Entwurf eines Gesetzes zur Weiterentwicklung des Asylbewerberleistungsgesetzes (Asylbewerberleistungsweiterentwick­ lungsgesetz – AsylbLWG),” Bundestags-Drucksache 20/9309 (2023) (in German; available online. Accessed on February 28, 2024. This applies o all other online sources in his repor unless stated otherwise). 2 This Weekly Repor uses he word refugees. This refers o all people who have",
    "submi ed an asylum claim in Germany regardless of he result. Thus, his includes people in he middle of heir asylum claim as well as people with a positive or negative (such as exceptional leave o remain or a requiremen o leave he country) asylum decision. Ukrainian refugees are no affected by he Asylbewerberleistungsgesetz and are hus no included in he analysis. 99 DIW Weekly Repor 12/2024 ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE they are “vital o ensuring [...] health.” With regard o health care, he AsylbLG offers considerable scope for discretion, as neither “acute pain conditions” according o Section 4 nor the “indispensability” of care according o Section 6 are pre­ cisely defined. I is herefore up o he responsible doctors o assess he situation and he social security offices o decide whether hey will approve reimbursement.3 This results in considerable inequality in refugees’ realized access o health care.4 I is clear, however, ha refugees mus initially expec considerable health care restrictions after heir arrival in Germany. Refugees have he same entitlements o health care services as social welfare recipients only after he end of he AsylbLG exclusion period5 or once heir asylum claim has been approved (SGB XII, Figure 1). The introduction of he AsylbLG in 1993 was accompanied by a change in health care financing from he health insur­ ance companies o he municipalities and hus required a new billing structure. Health care vouchers were introduced for his purpose: Before a doctor’s appointment, a refugee mus apply for a health care voucher from he responsi­ ble social security office. The social security office reviews adherence o he AsylbLG as well as he medical necessity of he doctor’s appointment. This process leads o unnec­ essary delays in reatmen and is viewed as a barrier o care 3 Amand Führer, “Determinanten der Gesundhei und medizinischen Versorgung von Asyl­ suchenden in Deutschland,” Bundesgesundheitsbla no. 10 (2023): 1083–91 (available online). 4 Oliver Razum, Judith Wenner, and Kayvan Bozorgmehr, “Wenn Zufall über den Zugang zur Ge­ sundheitsversorgung bestimmt: Geflüchtete in Deutschland,” Das Gesundheitswesen, no. 11 (2016): 711–714 (in German; available online). 5 The exclusion period of he AsylbLG has also been he subjec of reform discussions in he pas and has been changed several imes. Until September 2019, he period was 15 months. Be­ tween 2007 and 2015 i was 48 months, between 1997 and 2007 i was 36 months, and between 1993 and 1997 i was 12 months. by patients and doctors.6 In addition o he considerable amoun of administrative work required, medical laypeo­ ple are acting as gatekeepers o he health care system.7 An alternative system using an electronic health insurance card (EHIC) was introduced in Bremen for he firs ime in 2005 (Box 1). Currently, he EHIC has been introduced comprehen­ sively in six states: Berlin, Brandenburg, Bremen, Hamburg, Thuringia, and Schleswig-Holstein. The EHIC has also been introduced in individual districts and municipalities in hree other states (Figure 2). The 2019 change o he AsylbLG’s exclusion period and he gradual introduction",
    "of he EHIC since 2005 have resulted in differing health care entitlements for refugees depending on he place of residence and year. In addition, he entitle­ ments depend on he processing ime of he asylum claim, which has varied over he pas years and by he applicant’s country of origin. The number of refugees with exceptional leave o remain also plays a role, as hey are subjec o he AsylbLG regulations even after heir asylum process has been completed.8 Due o hese circumstances, i is currently unclear how long refugees actually had o wai for full health care entitlements. To assess he consequences of extending he exclusion period to 36 months, we mus look a how many refugees are actually affected by such an extension. Tha is, how many individuals 6 Anke Spura e al., “Wie erleben Asylsuchende den Zugang zu medizinischer Versorgung?” Bundesgesundheitsbla 60 (2017): 462–470 (in German; available online). 7 Führer, “Determinanten der Gesundhei und medizinischen Versorgung von Asylsuchenden in Deutschland.” 8 Many refugees whose asylum claim is rejected are granted an exceptional leave o remain, as returning o heir home country is no possible for various reasons. In recen years, he share of people whose asylum claim has been rejected who have been given exceptional leave o remain has consistently been around 80 percent.

Furthermore, i is unclear who is affected by long waiting imes: The length of he asylum process var­ ies depending on he applicant’s country of origin, meaning tha he actual waiting ime for regular health care entitle­ ments can vary greatly for certain groups of refugees. The burden of disease, especially for chronic illnesses, is higher among older refugees, women, or refugees with a low level of education and hese groups hus have a higher need for health services.9 If hese groups experience very long wait­ ing imes, hey experience a double hardship: No only are they ill more often and more acutely, bu hey also experi­ ence additional barriers in accessing he health care system. Some states have introduced he EHIC for refugees o sim­ plify administrative access o health care during he AsylbLG exclusion period. However, i is currently unclear who he EHIC benefits.

Figure 2 Coverage of he electronic health insurance card (EHIC) for refugees in Germany Source: Information portal of Medibüro/Medinetze (as of February 2024). © DIW Berlin 2024 The electronic health insurance card has been introduced comprehensively in six federal states, while i has been partially introduced in hree other states. Box 1 Electronic health insurance card for refugees The electronic health insurance card for refugees makes i possible for refugees o use health care services legally with­ ou a health care voucher. Refugees receive a chip card ha they can use o receive health care services directly in he same way as he statutorily insured via a framework agree­ men between state authorities and a health insurance pro­ vider. To his end, a range of services is defined in advance a state level ha complies with he AsylbLG.1 The costs of med­ ical care are covered by he municipality, bu he services are cheaper, as he municipalities now are subjec o he health insurance providers’ cos catalog.2 The health care companies receive an administrative fee per chip card for heir efforts; this is en euros per month per person in Hamburg, for exam­ ple.3 The EHIC makes access o health care easier by remov­ ing bureaucratic obstacles for both patients and doctors, by creating clarity abou he scope of health care services, and by minimizing waiting imes associated with he health care voucher system. In addition o he benefits for he municipalities, he introduc­ tion of he EHIC has significan benefits for he general health status and mental health of refugees.4 These benefits are espe­ cially eviden for refugees with language barriers.5 In addition, the introduction of he EHIC results in higher utilization of pri­ mary care6 while lowering utilization of emergency care.7 1 In practice, negotiating a benefits catalog with he health insurance providers often means ha he restrictions of he AsylbLG are less severe in regions with he EHIC and, with a few exceptions, correspond o he benefits catalog of he statutory health insurance com­ panies, see Marcel Wächter­Raquet, Einführung der Gesundheitskarte für Asylsuchende und Flüchtlinge.

Refugees’ have an average waiting ime of over one year before receiving full health care entitlements Overall, refugees who were living in Germany in 2021 waited over one year (376 days) until hey received full health care entitlements. Sixty-four percen of he refugees had o wai for the end of he AsylbLG exclusion period,10 whereas 36 percen were granted regular entitlements earlier due o heir asylum claim being accepted. Thus, he majority of refugees experi­ ence a long exclusion period under he AsylbLG (Figure 3). There are sligh bu statistically significan differences between men and women in he waiting period until full health care entitlements. On average, women had o wai 17 days longer han men (Figure 4). Refugees with a low 10 A his ime: 15 or 18 months. level of education also had o wai longer: On average, hey waited 24 days longer han refugees with a medium level of education. 36-month exclusion period likely o increase disadvantages for refugees with a low level of education and li le knowledge of German If refugees who were living in Germany in 2021 had had a waiting ime of 36 months instead of 18 (or 15), hey would have waited an additional 352 days on average before receiv­ ing regular health care entitlements. Fifty-two percen of he refugees would have had o wai for he end of he AsylbLG’s exclusion period—so 36 months—whereas 48 percen would have received earlier access due o heir asylum claim being accepted. A hypothetical validity period of 36 months greatly exacerbates the differences in waiting imes: Refugees with a low level of education would have o wai around hree months longer than refugees with an intermediate or high level of educa­ tion (Figure 5). Refugees with li le or intermediate knowl­ edge of German would have also had o wai around wo months longer han refugees who understand German well. Figure 3 Entitlements o health care system by months after arrival In percen of all refugees Note: Refugees who came o Germany between 2013 and 2020. Thus, for he majority of individuals, he maximum exclusion period was 15 months. Since 2019, he maximum exclusion period has been 18 months.

    "insurance card. The gradual introduc­ tion of he EHIC since 2005 has resulted in easier access o health care services for a otal of 17 percen of all refugees. Seven percen of refugees had full access o he health care system a he poin of introduction and could hus no ben­ efi from he EHIC although hey lived in a region where i was in use (Figure 6). Thus, so far only very few refugees or municipalities have been able o benefi from he intro­ duction of he EHIC (Box 1). The majority of refugees mus face he uncertainty, extra effort, and reatmen delays asso­ ciated with he health care voucher system. In addition, regional coverage of he EHIC is associated with inequality in regard o he refugees’ level of education: Thirty-four percen of refugees with a high level of educa­ tion live in a region with he EHIC. However, only 22 and 23 percen of refugees with an intermediate or low level of education, respectively (Figure 6), live in a region with he EHIC. Like he maximum exclusion period of he AsylbLG, the administrative regulations in he states resul in a sys­ tematic health disadvantage for refugees with a low level of education, although his group generally has a higher bur­ den of disease and already faces greater obstacles in access­ ing health care services. Longer exclusion period from healthcare entitlements: Hope for cos savings is shor sighted The actual waiting ime until regular health care entitle­ ments is already significan and will more han double by expanding he AsylbLG exclusion period o 36 months. I is short-sighted o assume ha limiting health care services will save money. In contrast, studies show ha limiting ref­ ugees’ health care is more cost-intensive in he long run.11 This is because limiting health care access increased he chance ha emergency or intensive reatmen is required. Early intervention in primary care, on he other hand, can preven expensive hospital stays, complex diagnostic proce­ dures, and serious disease progression.12 The argumen of cos savings is also short-sighted, as i ignores he consequences of poor health on refugees’ social and economic participation. I is well documented ha seri­ ous illness restricts a person’s ability o participate in educa­ tional opportunities, find and keep a job, ake care of heir family, and participate in social activities.13 No addressing 11 Kayvan Bozorgmehr and Oliver Razum, “Effec of Restricting Access o Health Care on Health Expenditures among Asylum­Seekers and Refugees: A Quasi­Experimental Study in Germany, 1994–2013,” PLoS ONE 10 (2015): (available online). 12 Aldo Rosano e al., “The relationship between avoidable hospitalization and accessibility o primary care: a systematic review,” European Journal of Public Health (2013): 356–360 (available online). 13 Maria K.

The data analysis methodol­ ogy is a means comparison of he waiting imes 1) under curren conditions, and 2) under a hypothetical expansion of he AsylbLG’s exclusion period o 36 months within and between groups with 95-percen confidence intervals. The coverage of he electronic health insurance card is calculated as a proportion of all refugees. To calculate he waiting ime until regular health care entitlements under he curren conditions (as of January 2024), wo pieces of information are linked: he ime since arrival in Germany and he date of approval of he asylum claim. If he approval occurred dur­ ing he exclusion period of he AsylbLG (15 months or 18 months after September 21, 2019), ime o approval was considered as he waiting ime until regular entitlements. Otherwise, he exclusion period of he AsylbLG was used. If no information abou he date of arrival in Germany was available, he date of he asylum claim is used. Individuals who have no ye received a decision on heir asylum claim a he ime of he survey and were still subjec o he exclusion period of he AsylbLG, and for whom he final waiting time was hus unclear, are excluded from he analysis. Overall, 2,181 refugees",
    "who participated in he 2021 survey are included in the analysis. Data on he date of arrival and he asylum claim are available for the respective month and year. For his analysis, however, days are used as he measure by using he midpoin of each month (the 15th day). I is assumed ha he arrival of refugees is evenly distributed over he month, so a correc average number of days is calculated with a sufficiently large sample size. An advantage o using days instead of months is ha distortions can be avoided if this information is linked with legislative changes, as hese often happen a he beginning of a month. In order o evaluate he waiting ime under a hypothetical ex­ pansion of he exclusion period of he AsylbLG o 36 months, data on he date of arrival in Germany and he date he asylum claim was approved are similarly linked. However, in his case, a waiting ime of 36 months is determined if he asylum claim was no approved within he firs 36 months. Otherwise, he ime until approval is considered as he waiting ime. As with he evaluation of he waiting ime under curren conditions, people who had no ye received a decision abou heir asylum claim and had been 1 Socio­Economic Panel, Daten der Jahre 1984-2021 (SOEP-Core, v38.1, Remote Edition – Update , 2023, available online). 2 Herber Brücker, Nina Rother, and Jürgen Schupp, “IAB­BAMF­SOEP­Befragung von Ge­ flüchteten 2016.

For his hypothetical scenario, 2,152 refugees who participated in he 2021 survey are included in he analysis. Regional data from SOEP is used o evaluate he coverage of he electronic health insurance card. These are linked with he date of introduction in he respective federal states, counties, or munic­ ipalities.3 A survey responden could benefi from he electronic health insurance card if hey lived in a region with he EHIC and its introduction happened before hey received regular access o the health care system (before he expiry of he AsylbLG exclusion period or he asylum claim). To investigate inequalities in regard o people with a special need for health care, he calculated waiting ime and EHIC coverage are considered separately according o four characteristics: gender (male/female), age group (17–29/30–49/50+), level of education in home country based on he ISCED-11 classification (low/medi­ um/high), and German language skills, with speaking, writing and reading skills each recorded on a scale of 1-5, summed, and hen tertiles of he otal score formed (low/medium/high). Cross-sectional weights are used for he analyses so ha he results are representative for refugees living in Germany in 2021 (excluding Ukrainian refugees, as he AsylbLG does no apply o them). 3 For more on his process, cf.

Thus, he savings cited in he CDU/CSU Parliamentary Group’s draf legislation canno be scientifically justified in regard o health care. Moreover, he presumption ha increasing he exclusion period of he AsylbLG will make Germany a less a ractive destination and ha he number of asylum seekers will decline is no scientifically ground­ ed.14 In he contex of forced migration, i is predominantly the conditions and events in he origin country ha deter­ mine if asylum figures rise or fall, while more or less restric­ tive laws in destination countries play a less importan role.15 Furthermore, increasing he exclusion period of he AsylbLG particularly affects refugees with a low level of education and li le knowledge of German. However, hese are he refugees tha have he highes disease burden and hus require swift, appropriate care.16 14 Wissenschaftlicher Diens des Deutschen Bundestags, Push- und Pull-Faktoren in der Migrationsforschung (2020) (in German; available online). 15 T.J.

This is a clear violation of he righ o health, o which Germany has com­ mi ed itself by ratifying he UN International Covenan on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.17 The restrictions are often justified by heir emporary nature, bu he long pro­ cessing ime of asylum claims in Germany, he high asylum claim acceptance rate, and he high share of refugees with exceptional leave o remain mean ha he restrictions affec the people who remain in Germany for long periods of ime. Moreover, he health care restrictions resul in negative health outcomes for refugees in he short-term, as well as incurring long-term costs for he state if delayed reatmen results in high costs for emergency or intensive care. Instead of creating additional legal barriers for refugees, access o the health care system should be made easier, for example through low-threshold health care provision in refugee shel­ ters,18 he nationwide introduction of he EHIC o remove administrative barriers,19 and appropriate interpretation and translation services.20 The introduction of he EHIC for refugees offers significan health and economic benefits, bu is insufficiently imple­ mented. By removing administrative barriers related o he health care voucher, health care services can be accessed ear­ lier instead of delaying reatment. Arguments agains he introduction of he EHIC are he relatively high adminis­",
    "tration fees charged by health insurance companies and he feared increase in health care costs. However, administrative costs of 1.6 million euros were saved annually in Hamburg using he EHIC compared o he health care voucher sys­ tem.21 Furthermore, easier access o health care via he EHIC did no lead o inappropriate use: In he Ruhr area, for exam­ ple, he number of doctor’s visits increased following he introduction of he EHIC, bu was still lower han among non-refugees.22 Thus, primary health care costs may rise in the shor erm depending on health needs.23 However, his 17 Kayvan Bozorgmehr, Judith Wenner, and Oliver Razum, “Restricted access o health care for asylum­seekers: applying a human rights lens o he argumen of resource constraints,” European Journal of Public Health 27 (2017): 592–593 (available online). 18 Katharina Wahedi e al., “Medizinische Versorgung von Asylsuchenden in Erstaufnahme­ einrichtungen,” Bundesgesundheitsbla 63 (2020): 1460–1469 (in German; available online). 19 Führer, “Determinanten der Gesundhei und medizinischen Versorgung von Asylsuchenden in Deutschland.” 20 Amand Führer and Patrick Brzoska, “Die Relevanz des Dolmetschens im Gesundheitssystem,“ Gesundheitswesen (2022): 474–478 (in German; available online). 21 Frank Burmester, Auswirkungen der Zusammenarbei mi der AOK Bremen / Bremerhaven aus Sich der Behörde für Arbeit, Soziales, Familie und Integration.
