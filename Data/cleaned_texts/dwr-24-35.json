After it appeared \n\nto finally be growing at the start of 2024, it experienced a slight \n\nsetback in the second quarter. Although incomes are rising \n\nand inflation is now near the two-percent target, people in Ger­\n\nmany are saving their money. As investments and exports fal­\n\ntered due to the sluggish industrial sector, the upturn has been \n\ndelayed for the time being. Overall economic output is likely to \n\nstagnate in 2024, but it will likely pick up at the end of the year; \n\ngrowth of 0.9 and 1.4 percent is expected in 2025 and 2026, \n\nrespectively. Private consumption, which will increase more \n\nslowly than expected but still provide a stimulating effect, will \n\nprimarily support this growth. As interest rates continue to fall \n\nworldwide, foreign trade and investments are also supporting \n\ngrowth. The global economy has returned to its recovery path, \n\nbut expanded more weakly in the second quarter compared \n\nto the first. Growth in China in particular has stalled somewhat, \n\nand there are also signs of an upcoming economic slowdown \n\nin the United States. Following growth of 3.8 percent in 2024, \n\nthe global economy is expected to expand by only 3.5 percent \n\nin 2025, but develop more dynamically again in 2026.\n\nGlobal economy: recovery expected to continue, \n\nwhile the US economy cools off\n\nThe global economy weakened in the second quarter of 2024. \n\nFollowing a 1.0-percent increase in the first quarter, it only \n\ngrew by 0.7 percent in the second (Figure 1). Growth stalled \n\nin the emerging economies in particular; this was due to the \n\ndevelopment in China, where domestic demand remained \n\nweak. In contrast, a bit more momentum came from the \n\nadvanced economies, especially the United States and the \n\neuro area, where inflation rates continued to decline. This \n\nresulted in a first interest rate cut in the euro area in June.\n\nCarried by consumption and exports, the advanced econo­\n\nmies expanded by 0.6 percent in the second quarter. The euro \n\narea economy remained on its recovery path and grew again \n\nby 0.3 percent. Foreign trade in particular made a positive \n\ncontribution to growth due to rising exports. Spain (0.8 per­\n\ncent) and the Netherlands (1.0 percent) provided particularly \n\nstrong support for the economic recovery in the euro area. \n\nFrance and Italy also recorded positive quarterly growth in \n\nthe second quarter, with 0.3 percent each. Germany was the \n\nonly major euro area country to make a negative contribu­\n\ntion to growth with -0.1 percent. In the United Kingdom, \n\neconomic output continued to rise significantly by 0.6 per­\n\ncent, supported primarily by a strong increase in inventories.\n\nThe US economy also experienced strong growth of 0.7 per­\n\ncent in the second quarter, still driven by robust consumer \n\nspending and corporate investments. In contrast to its neg­\n\native start to the year, Japan's GDP expanded by 0.8 percent. \n\nTax relief and real wage growth as a result of larger wage \n\nincreases have spurred private consumption.\n\nAmong the emerging economies, which expanded by 0.8 per­\n\ncent overall, only China performed poorly: The Chinese econ­\n\nomy grew by merely 0.7 percent in the second quarter, com­\n\npared to a strong 1,5 percent in the first. Negative factors, such \n\nas the still struggling real estate market, subdued domestic \n\ndemand, and severe storms and flooding dampened growth, \n\nwhile fiscal and monetary policy measures only had a limited \n\n225\n\nDIW Weekly Report 35–39/2024\n\nDIW BERLIN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK\n\nimpact on the problems in the real estate market.1 In contrast, \n\nstrong foreign demand and government investments in the \n\nhigh-tech sector contributed positively to growth. The Indian \n\neconomy continued to expand thanks to strong domestic \n\neconomic activity. The Mexican and Brazilian economies \n\ncontinued to grow, although momentum is slowing some­\n\nwhat. Restrictive monetary policy had an impact in these \n\ncountries and the export sector felt the effects of the weaker \n\nglobal economy. Poland stands out among the Central and \n\nSoutheastern European countries with impressive quarterly \n\ngrowth of 1.5 percent.\n\nIn the current third quarter, most advanced economies are \n\nexpected to contribute a bit less to the recovery than pre­\n\nviously. In particular, the US economy is likely to contract \n\nslightly as a result of less dynamic consumption and a dete­\n\nriorating situation in the labor market. By contrast, the euro \n\narea economy without Germany is likely to continue its recov­\n\nery path. Steady growth in real wages will probably strengthen \n\ndomestic demand. No momentum is expected from the \n\neuro area industry: While the Manufacturing Purchasing \n\nManagers' Indices (PMI) of the individual euro area coun­\n\ntries in the first half of 2024 still showed signs of recovery, \n\nthey have been declining again since June. Companies are \n\npessimistic in terms of political uncertainty (France), declin­\n\ning orders and rising prices for intermediary goods and \n\nlabor costs (Spain, Netherlands, Italy). The outlook is also \n\ndeteriorating in most Member States in the services sector, \n\nbut the indices remain above the expansion threshold. The \n\nmood has improved in France due to the Olympic Games. \n\nThe outlook for the third quarter for the United Kingdom \n\nis good: Both the upward trend in the PMIs in all economic \n\nsectors and the rise in consumer confidence point to a fur­\n\nther recovery. Real wage increases are likely to continue \n\nboosting consumption. In Japan, the recovery in domestic \n\ndemand is providing slight growth stimuli in the third quar­\n\nter. At the same time, there are also only very weak signals \n\nfor a recovery in the Japanese manufacturing industries; the \n\nPMI has been stuck below the expansion threshold of 50 for \n\ntwo months in a row.\n\nGrowth is expected to be stronger in the emerging econo­\n\nmies in the third quarter than in the second quarter. The \n\nIndian economy should continue to grow dynamically. The \n\nChinese economy is likely to benefit from rising exports and \n\ninvestments in the high-tech sector. Despite all the stimulat­\n\ning monetary and fiscal policy measures, domestic demand \n\nis likely to continue to suffer from the problems on the real \n\nestate market, which puts into question the Chinese govern­\n\nment's annual growth target of five percent for 2024.\n\nDespite still pending or already initiated interest rate cuts, \n\nmonetary policy in the advanced economies is likely to \n\nremain restrictive. The neutral rate of interest will prob­\n\nably be reached by the end of 2025 in many places. The \n\n1 \n\nCf.

Accessed on \n\n August 29, 2024. This applies to all other online sources in this report unless stated otherwise).\n\nEuropean Central Bank announced an interest rate turna­\n\nround in June (Box 1) and the Bank of England followed in \n\nAugust. In the United States, a turnaround in interest rates \n\nis likely in mid-September in response to steadily falling \n\ninflation. In contrast, the Bank of Japan decided on a further \n\ninterest rate hike in July due to high inflation and a weak \n\nyen. This is a sign that the years of ultra-expansive mone­\n\ntary policy are coming to an end, but have led to short-lived \n\nglobal stock market turbulence.\n\nCentral banks in many emerging economies have been cut­\n\nting key interest rates for some time now. Key interest rates \n\nhave been declining regularly in Brazil due to falling infla­\n\ntion rates and weak economic growth. There were also inter­\n\nest rate cuts in Mexico in March and August, although they \n\nwere more moderate due to persistent inflation. The People’s \n\nBank of China is following a more expansive course due to \n\ndeflationary tendencies. There, the weak recovery following \n\nthe coronavirus pandemic and debt problems, especially in \n\nthe real estate sector, are dampening price pressure.\n\nInterest rates, which remain high in most economies, limit \n\nfiscal policy. Fiscal policy will thus continue to be slightly \n\nrestrictive during the forecast period, especially in the euro \n\narea. Governments remain under pressure to save due to \n\ninterest rates declining only gradually, which is likely to \n\nresult in reduced spending on medium-term investment \n\nprograms. Existing programs such as the NextGenerationEU \n\nshould, however, still have a positive impact on invest­\n\nments in Member States.

In the \n\nUnited Kingdom, the Labor government is likely to provide \n\nnew impetus in its autumn budget. However, it will have \n\nvery limited fiscal leeway and will probably be unable to \n\navoid tax increases; the government has already announced \n\ninitial cost cutting measures. No new significant fiscal pol­\n\nicy stimuli are expected in the United States, as in an elec­\n\ntion year, neither party has any incentive to curb the high \n\ndeficits.

However, according to recent fig­\n\nures, only a fraction of the funds was disbursed to bail out \n\nproperty developers.\n\nInternational trade is recovering slowly; powerful growth \n\nrates are not expected in 2024 overall. The ongoing global \n\nindustrial weakness in the advanced economies will likely \n\nstill weigh on international trade in 2025. Falling interest \n\nrates, however, should revive corporate investment, and thus \n\nalso international trade, from mid 2025.\n\nOver the rest of the forecast period, global growth rates are \n\nexpected to be muted in 2025 before becoming more dynamic \n\nin 2026 (Table 1). In winter 2024/2025, inflation rates in \n\nmany places will reach the target corridor of the central \n\nbanks. As interest rates fall, monetary policy in most econ­\n\nomies will switch from a restrictive policy to a more neu­\n\ntral one by the end of 2025, thereby supporting economic \n\nBox 1\n\nAssumptions and framework conditions\n\nThis forecast is based on the following assumptions about the \n\nfurther development of key interest rates, exchange rates, and \n\ncommodity prices (Table). These assumptions were made based \n\non previous development, futures markets prices, and the closing \n\nprices on the date of this forecast (August 19, 2024). The European \n\nCentral Bank (ECB) first decreased interest rates in June. After \n\na year of stable interest rates, it has now initiated a turnaround. \n\nSix further interest rate cuts are assumed over the forecast hori­\n\nzon, which are likely to take place at every second ECB meeting. \n\nSpecifically, it is assumed that the ECB will cut interest rates for the \n\nsecond time in September, again by 25 basis points. At the same \n\ntime, the Central Bank will, as announced, decrease the interest \n\nrate corridor between the main refinancing rate and the deposit \n\nrate from 50 to 15 basis points. For some time now, the ECB has \n\nbeen steering the economy via the deposit rate and not the main \n\nrefinancing rate. The deposit rate is thus the key indicator for inter­\n\nest rate changes. The subsequent interest rate cuts are assumed \n\nto be 25 basis points each, which results in a reduction of the de­\n\nposit rate by 75 basis points in both 2024 and 2025.\n\nMoney market interest rates fell at the beginning of 2024 in antic­\n\nipation of the interest rate turnaround. It is assumed that these, in \n\nline with key interest rates, will continue to fall over the forecast \n\nhorizon. The refinancing costs for households and companies are \n\nlikely to decline as key interest rates fall over the coming years. \n\nThe return on government bonds increased again slightly fol­\n\nlowing a brief decline at the beginning of 2024. It is assumed that \n\ncapital market interest rates will remain largely unchanged over \n\nthe forecast horizon at 2.4 percent for Germany and 3.1 percent \n\nfor the euro area. The euro has recently depreciated against the \n\nUS dollar due to the interest rate differential. For the forecast peri­\n\nod, it is assumed that the exchange rate of EUR to USD will remain \n\nat 1.09 USD per EUR.\n\nUncertainties about the gas supply in the coming year resulted \n\nin slight increases in the wholesale price for gas (TTF) recently. \n\nHowever, well-filled gas storage facilities should prevent a severe \n\nsupply shortage. According to futures, the average gas price \n\nshould be around 34.50 (2024), 41.90 (2025), and 35.70 euros \n\n(2026) per megawatt hours. The price for Brent crude oil will de­\n\ncline slightly over the forecast horizon according to traded futures. \n\nIn 2024, the average price is likely to be 84,60 USD per barrel be­\n\nfore it declines to an average of 76,70 USD per barrel in 2025 and \n\nfinally to 73,70 USD per barrel in 2026. This forecast is also based \n\non political assumptions: We assume that no further escalations \n\nwill occur, but also that none of the current geopolitical crises, such \n\nas the Israeli-Hamas War, the Russo-Ukrainian War, and the con­\n\nflict between China and Taiwan, will end.\n\nTable\n\nForecast assumptions\n\n2023\n\n2024\n\n2025\n\n2026\n\nECB deposit rate1 (year end)\n\nPercent\n\n4.0\n\n3.25\n\n2.5\n\n2.5\n\nMoney market interest rate\n\nThree-month EURIBOR in percent\n\n3.4\n\n3.5\n\n2.4\n\n2.2\n\nCapital market interest\n\nYield on euro-area government bonds with \n\na remaining term of ten years\n\n3.3\n\n3.1\n\n3.1\n\n3.1\n\nCapital market interest\n\nYield on German government bonds with a \n\nremaining term of ten years\n\n2.6\n\n2.5\n\n2.4\n\n2.4\n\nExchange rate\n\nUSD/EUR\n\n1.08\n\n1.09\n\n1.09\n\n1.09\n\nCrude oil price\n\nUSD per barrel\n\n82.5\n\n82.6\n\n76.7\n\n73.7\n\nGas price\n\nEUR per megawatt hour\n\n42.1\n\n34.5\n\n41.9\n\n35.7\n\n1 The ECB steers the economy via the deposit rate, not the key interest rate.\n\nNote: Annual average unless indicated otherwise. \n\nSources: European Central Bank; European Money Markets Institute (EMMI); Eurex Exchange; Deutsche Bundesbank; \n\nFederal Reserve; Energy Information Administration (EIA); Intercontinental Exchange (ICE); CME Group; DIW Berlin \n\nEconomic Forecast Autumn 2024.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\n227\n\nDIW Weekly Report 35–39/2024\n\nDIW BERLIN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK\n\ndevelopment, especially corporate investment and con­\n\nstruction. In the advanced economies, the opposing trends \n\nbetween the United States and Europe are likely to con­\n\nverge. While the United States has left the euro area behind \n\nin terms of growth over the past years, the situation there \n\nnow seems to be deteriorating, while signs in the euro area \n\nare pointing to growth again.\n\nThe gradual slowdown in economic momentum in the \n\nUnited States is primarily being driven by declining private \n\nconsumption and the labor market. However, the labor mar­\n\nket seems to be more robust than the unemployment rate, \n\nwhich has been higher since spring, would suggest. The \n\nunemployment rate is likely overstated due to the immigra­\n\ntion boom. Even if some indicators point to an increased risk \n\nof a recession in the United States, a gradual slowdown in \n\nthe pace of expansion seems more likely, especially as the \n\nUS Federal Reserve has sufficient leeway to cut interest rates.\n\nIn the euro area, on the other hand, the purchasing power \n\nof private households is likely to increase further thanks \n\nto lower inflation and higher nominal wages, even if real \n\nwages in the euro area are still one percentage point below \n\npre-pandemic levels and even further below pre-energy cri­\n\nsis levels (Figure 2).

Chinese GDP is likely to con­\n\ntinue its powerful development, but growth rates are likely \n\nto be lower than before the pandemic. The previous invest­\n\nment-driven growth model seems to have reached its lim­\n\nits and has not been replaced by private  consumption so far.\n\nOn an annual average, the advanced economies are expected \n\nto expand by only 1.7 percent in 2024, while economic out­\n\nput will likely increase by 4.9 percent in the emerging econ­\n\nomies. Overall, the global economy is expected to grow by \n\n3.8 percent in 2024, 0.1 percentage points more than fore­\n\ncast in summer. In 2025, global growth is likely to be some­\n\nwhat weaker at 3.5 percent, due to the US economy cooling \n\ndown, before growing more dynamically again by 3.7 per­\n\ncent in 2026. Thus, the forecast for 2025 is 0.1 percentage \n\npoints less than expected in summer.\n\nThis forecast is subject to many uncertainty factors. For \n\nexample, the inflation rates, especially in the United States \n\nand the euro area, could decline more slowly than expected, \n\nwhich would result in a longer phase of restrictive mone­\n\ntary policy and thus dampen economic growth. If inflation \n\nfell more quickly, in contrast, it could support consumption \n\nmore and lead to more rapid interest rate cuts. Geopolitical \n\nrisks remain quite high. The war in the Middle East could \n\nescalate further, which would likely lead to higher oil and \n\nnatural gas prices. The war in Ukraine, the development of \n\nwhich is difficult to predict, is a further risk. Donald Trump’s \n\npossible re-election in November could lead to major uncer­\n\ntainties regarding the direction of US economic and security \n\npolicy. The trade conflict between China and the West could \n\nalso escalate further and have a negative impact on interna­\n\ntional trade. Generally, the risk of political polarization is \n\nhigh in many places; extremist parties are gaining ground \n\nworldwide. In the long term, this populism harbors consid­\n\nerable risks for growth and prosperity prospects, especially if \n\nit ignores or undermines fundamental economic principles.\n\nFigure 2\n\nReal wages in the euro area\n\nIndex December 1, 2019 = 100\n\n \n\nSources: ECB; Eurostat; DIW Berlin Economic Outlook Autumn 2024.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nAlthough there has been a strong increase in real wages, they have not yet reached \n\npre-pandemic levels in most countries.\n\n229\n\nDIW Weekly Report 35–39/2024\n\nDIW BERLIN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK\n\nGerman economy caught in a slump\n\nThe German economy remains stuck in a phase of weak \n\ngrowth. Following a slight 0.2 percent increase in GDP at \n\nthe beginning of the year, this positive development did not \n\ncontinue: Economic output contracted slightly by 0.1 percent \n\nin the second quarter (Figure 33). A recovery failed to materi­\n\nalize. On the one hand, private household consumption was \n\nsignificantly lower than the increase in disposable income \n\nsince the energy crisis had suggested. On the other hand, \n\ninvestments in equipment and in construction slumped and \n\nexports declined, probably primarily due to persistent low \n\ndomestic and foreign demand for industrial goods.\n\nPrivate consumption contracted somewhat in the second \n\nquarter: Private households seem to be unsettled, both due \n\nto the political and economic conditions as well as the low \n\nbut steady rise in unemployment. This likely resulted in \n\nconsumers consuming less in the second quarter than they \n\ndid at the beginning of the year, despite strong increases in \n\nreal wages. In line with this, private households are saving \n\na bit more of their income: At 10.8 percent, the savings rate \n\nis currently slightly higher than in 2023.4 Consumer senti­\n\nment is dampened, likely due to the high price level. While \n\ninflation has stabilized noticeably recently and consistently \n\nbeen under three percent since the beginning of 2024, core \n\ninflation and the price increases in the services sector in par­\n\nticular have remained elevated, likely having curbed con­\n\nsumption. As expected in early summer, the UEFA European \n\nMen’s Football Championship did not noticeably boost pri­\n\nvate consumption in Germany.\n\nForeign trade also did not provide any growth stimuli in \n\nthe second quarter. While strong exports of intermediate \n\ngoods, such as chemical and plastic products, had indicated \n\na recovery in the global industry5 and thus German trade \n\nat the beginning of the year, exports of these goods signifi­\n\ncantly declined again in the second quarter. Although travel \n\nboosted service exports, it was unable to prevent the decline \n\nin exports overall. Service imports also experienced strong \n\ngrowth, while goods imports fell slightly. Overall, imports \n\nstagnated, resulting in a slightly negative balance of exports \n\nand imports in the second quarter.\n\nThe decline in investments was even greater. Particularly pri­\n\nvate investment in equipment suffered a serious slump; in \n\nthe second quarter, it was at its lowest level since the produc­\n\ntion restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic. In con­\n\ntrast, public equipment investment had a stimulating effect. \n\nThe downward trend of recent years also continued in con­\n\nstruction investment, which declined significantly, mainly \n\nin residential and public construction.\n\n3 Detailed figures on the forecast for the Germany economy can be found in the online appendix \n\n(in German).\n\n4 The general revision of the VGR data results in the savings rate for Germany being revised \n\ndownward significantly. Until recently, the data showed a significantly higher savings rate level \n\nthan was the case before the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n5 For more, see the section on the global economy in this Weekly Report.\n\nThe evolution of gross value added (GVA) in the second quar­\n\nter shows that the gap between the services and manufactur­\n\ning sectors is growing. Overall, GVA declined by 0.1 percent, \n\nthe same rate as GDP. While production declined slightly in \n\nmanufacturing, it plummeted in the construction industry. \n\nAs a result, the manufacturing industry as a whole reduced \n\nGVA by 0.3 percent. Services increased slightly, supporting \n\nGVA by 0.1 percent. However, it was a mixed picture in the \n\nindividual economic sectors. Value added in the consum­\n\ner-related sectors decreased, while business-related services \n\nwere able to expand their production. This development in \n\nvalue added is also reflected in the latest labor market figures: \n\nemployment has continued to rise overall, albeit at a slightly \n\nslower rate than at the beginning of the year. Employment \n\nexpanded in the services sector but declined in the ailing \n\nmanufacturing industry as well as construction. Overall, \n\nhowever, the labor market has so far remained stable, even \n\nif unemployment is rising.\n\nStagnation expected in the third quarter for the \n\nGerman economy\n\nThe recovery of the German economy is likely to remain \n\nelusive in the current third quarter; GDP is not projected \n\nto increase (Table 2). Private consumption is still projected \n\nto expand, although less powerfully than was implied in \n\nspring (Figure 4). Consumer confidence indicators, which \n\nrose steadily during the first half of 2024, have recently expe­\n\nrienced a slight downturn. Households’ willingness to spend \n\nFigure 3\n\nGrowth of real GDP in Germany\n\nIn billions of euros (left axis) and quarter-on-quarter percentage \n\ngrowth (right axis)\n\n \n\nNote: Forecast from the third quarter of 2024; price, seasonally, and calendar adjusted. \n\nSources: National Statistical Offices; DIW Berlin Economic Outlook Autumn 2024.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nThe German economy will not grow again until the end of 2024.\n\n230\n\nDIW Weekly Report 35–39/2024\n\nDIW BERLIN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK\n\nwill likely remain dampened due to uncertainty about the \n\neconomy and worries about job loss given the rising unem­\n\nployment figures. At the same time, the strong real wage \n\nincreases since mid-2023 have extensively compensated for \n\nthe losses during the energy crisis and are expected to support \n\nconsumption in the second half of 2024. Low-income house­\n\nholds have likely continued to experience strong income \n\ngrowth recently, which should benefit private consump­\n\ntion, as these households have a higher propensity to con­\n\nsume. Income for higher income groups, in contrast, has \n\nincreased somewhat less strongly than previously. As a result, \n\nlabor income inequality should remain the same this year \n\n(Figure 5). Additionally, consumer price inflation is contin­\n\nually declining, and—especially thanks to decreasing energy \n\nprices—fell below the two-percent target for the first time \n\nsince March 2021 in August 2024, bringing the annual aver­\n\nage closer to the inflation target of the European Central Bank \n\n(ECB). Leading price indicators such as import and whole­\n\nsale prices also suggest this. Although some of these indi­\n\ncators are rising again, the rates remain well below two per­\n\ncent. Stable price development should strengthen consumer \n\nconfidence once more and stimulate private consumption. \n\nRobust employment expansion, which the services sector \n\nwill likely continue to drive, should also support private con­\n\nsumption. Cyclical unemployment is expected to continue \n\nto rise slightly due to weak economic development (Table 3).\n\nInvestments are expected to make a negative contribution to \n\neconomic growth again in the current quarter. Investment \n\nin equipment continues to suffer due to weak industrial pro­\n\nduction and a lack of demand; the stock of existing orders is \n\nshrinking while new orders are faltering. In construction, \n\ndespite the initiated interest rate shift, the persistently high \n\ninterest rates and the high and continuously rising construc­\n\ntion costs remain the key obstacles and are likely to further \n\nslow down residential construction in the second half of the \n\nyear. Although the volume of new residential construction \n\nloans has increased somewhat again recently, this is not yet \n\nreflected in the approval and order figures. Corporate capac­\n\nity utilization in building construction recently declined to \n\nits lowest value since 2010. In contrast, civil engineering is \n\nexpected to continue to support construction investment.\n\nThe demand from abroad for German intermediate and capi­\n\ntal goods is also likely to remain weak in the current quarter. \n\nThe ifo Export Expectations fell for the third time in a row in \n\nAugust; thus, another decline in goods exports is expected \n\nfor the third quarter. Service exports, which make up a good \n\n20 percent of German foreign trade, should expand further \n\ndue to the growing importance of the domestic and foreign \n\nservice sectors. The IT sector in particular as well as tour­\n\nist traffic are carrying this development, although they are \n\nunlikely to be able to increase total exports. In light of weak \n\nexports and sluggish industrial output, imports are expected \n\nto continue to develop meekly, although goods imports are \n\nalso expected to fall and services imports to increase in the \n\ncurrent global and domestic economic environment. Overall, \n\na negative trade balance is projected for the third quarter.\n\nTable 2\n\nQuarterly data on the development of expenditure and production components of real GDP in Germany\n\nIn percent (quarter-on-quarter, seasonally and calendar adjusted)\n\n2023 \n\n2024 \n\n2025 \n\n2026 \n\nI\n\nII\n\nIII\n\nIV\n\nI\n\nII\n\nIII\n\nIV\n\nI\n\nII\n\nIII\n\nIV\n\nI\n\nII\n\nIII\n\nIV\n\nPrivate consumption\n\n−0.4\n\n0.8\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.3\n\n−0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\nPublic consumption expenditure\n\n0.2\n\n−0.2\n\n1.2\n\n0.7\n\n−0.1\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.5\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\nGross fixed capital formation\n\n0.6\n\n−0.2\n\n−0.3\n\n−1.4\n\n0.1\n\n−2.2\n\n−0.3\n\n0.1\n\n0.5\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\nConstruction\n\n1.3\n\n−0.7\n\n−1.3\n\n−1.9\n\n0.8\n\n−2.0\n\n−0.5\n\n−0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\nMachinery and equipment\n\n−1.0\n\n−0.2\n\n0.5\n\n−2.1\n\n−1.6\n\n−4.1\n\n−0.2\n\n0.8\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.1\n\n1.2\n\n1.3\n\n1.3\n\nOther investment\n\n1.7\n\n1.0\n\n0.9\n\n1.4\n\n1.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.9\n\n1.1\n\n1.1\n\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\nInventory changes1\n\n−0.3\n\n−0.1\n\n−0.2\n\n−0.7\n\n−0.1\n\n0.4\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\nDomestic consumption\n\n−0.3\n\n0.2\n\n−0.1\n\n−0.9\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\nTrade balance\n\n0.5\n\n−0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.5\n\n0.2\n\n−0.1\n\n−0.2\n\n−0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\nExports\n\n0.2\n\n−0.4\n\n−0.7\n\n−0.9\n\n1.3\n\n−0.2\n\n−0.1\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\nImports\n\n−1.0\n\n0.5\n\n−1.4\n\n−2.0\n\n0.8\n\n0.0\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\n0.7\n\n0.7\n\n0.7\n\n0.7\n\nGDP\n\n0.1\n\n−0.2\n\n0.2\n\n−0.4\n\n0.2\n\n−0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\nGross value added\n\n0.5\n\n−0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.6\n\n0.0\n\n−0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\nManufacturing\n\n1.1\n\n−0.1\n\n−1.0\n\n0.0\n\n−1.0\n\n−0.2\n\n−0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\nConstruction\n\n5.9\n\n−0.6\n\n−1.1\n\n−1.9\n\n1.9\n\n−3.2\n\n−0.7\n\n−0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\nTrade, hospitality, transport\n\n−1.1\n\n−0.2\n\n0.6\n\n0.9\n\n0.3\n\n−0.6\n\n0.1\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\nBusiness services providers\n\n−0.2\n\n0.5\n\n0.2\n\n1.2\n\n−0.3\n\n0.9\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\nPublic services, education, health\n\n0.4\n\n0.1\n\n0.7\n\n0.2\n\n0.5\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n1 Contribution to growth in percentage points.\n\nNote: Forecast from the third quarter of 2024.\n\nSources: Federal Statistical Office, DIW Berlin Economic Outlook Autumn 2024.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\n231\n\nDIW Weekly Report 35–39/2024\n\nDIW BERLIN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK\n\nFigure 4\n\nGross domestic product and key components\n\nSeasonally, calendar, and price-adjusted development\n\n \n\nNote: Forecast from the third quarter of 2024; price, seasonally, and calendar adjusted.\n\nSources: Federal Statistical Office; DIW Berlin Economic Outlook Autumn 2024.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\n232\n\nDIW Weekly Report 35–39/2024\n\nDIW BERLIN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK\n\nThe split evolution of the industrial and services sectors is \n\nexpected to continue on the production side in the third \n\nquarter. Although sentiment in both sectors has recently \n\ndeteriorated somewhat according to the Purchasing \n\nManager Indices for Germany, sentiment remains more \n\nrobust and above the expansion threshold of 50 points in \n\nthe services sector, supported by growing demand. In the \n\nindustrial sector, in contrast, the index is consistently below \n\nthe expansion threshold. According to the ifo Business \n\nClimate Index survey in August, the business climate in \n\nthe industrial sector has fallen for the third time in a row, \n\nwith the respondents rating both the current situation and \n\nfuture business as critical. The lack of orders is increas­\n\ningly becoming a problem and will likely impede produc­\n\ntion in the current quarter.\n\nGradual recovery over the course of the forecast\n\nThe German economy is expected to recover over the course \n\nof the forecast, although more sluggishly than the indica­\n\ntors suggested during the summer. In terms of the domes­\n\ntic economy, the positive real wage trend, which should be \n\nsupported by low inflation rates and continue throughout the \n\nforecast period, is likely to have the greatest impact initially. \n\nWhile employees’ bargaining power has weakened somewhat \n\nwith the slight decline in the Labor Shortage Index, the col­\n\nlective wage negotiations planned for the end of 2024, such \n\nas in the public sector as well as the metalworking and elec­\n\ntrical industry, are expected to result in further strong nom­\n\ninal wage increases. Unemployment will reach its peak at \n\nthe beginning of 2025 and decline as the economy recovers \n\nand integration processes, particularly of Ukrainian refu­\n\ngees, progress. This development benefits private consump­\n\ntion, which is expected to support economic output at the \n\nturn of the year. Government consumption should continue \n\nto contribute positively to GDP. Expenditure on a moderate \n\nincrease in employment in the public sector is likely to sup­\n\nport growth in 2024 and 2025, while social benefits in kind, \n\nparticularly in the areas of health and care services, will prob­\n\nably be expanded throughout the forecast period.\n\nGerman foreign trade is not expected to noticeably increase \n\nagain until 2025. Supported by falling interest rates world­\n\nwide and a gradual upturn in investment activity abroad, \n\ndemand for German industrial goods should rekindle. \n\nHowever, German goods exports are unlikely to expand as \n\ndynamically as in the past due to strong competition from \n\nChina. As a result, the share of services of total exports should \n\nincrease further over the forecast horizon. Goods imports \n\nwill likely benefit from the recovery of the export business \n\nand the improvement in German industrial production and \n\npick up. As German exports of industrial and capital goods \n\nshould be somewhat weaker, goods imports will probably \n\nexceed exports in relative terms. This results in a slightly \n\nnegative trade balance for the German economy in both \n\n2025 and 2026 (Table 4).\n\nRising foreign demand should boost private equipment \n\ninvestment again from the second half of 2025.

However, considerable catch-up \n\neffects are not expected over the forecast period, as the \n\nrecovery of the industrial sector will likely be slow. The pub­\n\nlic sector will continue to support equipment investment, \n\nin particular with the special fund for the German armed \n\nforces (Sondervermögen Bundeswehr), which should lead to \n\na significant increase in public spending. Construction \n\ninvestments will not pick up until the second half of 2025, \n\nwhen construction costs will gradually stabilize. This is \n\ndecisive for residential construction in particular, which \n\nshould not pick up until 2026. In contrast, investment in \n\nnon-residential construction is likely to expand continu­\n\nously, with civil engineering in particular continuing to \n\ndrive the positive trend.\n\nDespite falling interest rates, monetary policy will initially \n\nremain restrictive and is not expected to reach the range of \n\nBox 2\n\nImpact of fiscal policy measures on private consumption and GDP\n\nFiscal policy measures in 2024 and 2025 will be restrictive overall \n\nand are expected to contract by 0.7 and 0.4 percent of GDP year-\n\non-year. In 2026, fiscal policy will become neutral again. In accord­\n\nance with fiscal policy assumptions, the majority of the Federal \n\nGovernment's growth initiative measures are not considered here.\n\nThe majority of fiscal measures affect private households. A DSGE \n\nmodel with two different household types (TANK model) is used to \n\nestimate the stimulating effect of private consumption and GDP \n\nwhile accounting for their distributional effects. To this end, a dis­\n\ntinction is first made between the extent to which the measures \n\naffect the lowest-income 40 percent of households and how the \n\nremaining households benefit or are negatively affected.\n\nThe 40 percent with the lowest incomes earn around 20 percent of \n\ntotal disposable income and have a savings rate of zero, which is \n\nwhy they are referred to as liquidity-constrained (LC) households. \n\nIn addition to private households, there are the measures that af­\n\nfect companies or the Federal Government. Fiscal policy measures \n\nare divided into six categories according to their impact on the two \n\nhousehold types and other actors:\n\n1. Measures that affect LC households only\n\n2. Measures that affect all households per capita\n\n3. Measures that affect all households proportionally to \n\ntheir income\n\n4. Measures that affect high-income households only\n\n5. Measures that affect companies (differentiated by effect on \n\nprofits and subsidies)\n\n6. Measures that affect the government\n\nSince the two household types differ in their consumption behav­\n\nior, the consumption effect will be highest for low-income house­\n\nholds in particular and decline over the other three categories. \n\nSome of the measures that will relieve low-income households in \n\nparticular are the basic income (Bürgergeld) and housing bene­\n\nfits (Wohngeld) reforms in 2024 and the introduction of the basic \n\nchild benefit in 2025. Moreover, the change to the basic pension \n\nfrom 2024 should support low-income households. High-income \n\nhouseholds are likely to benefit from the Inflationsausgleichgesetz \n\n(Inflation Adjustment Act) and, in particular, from the correspond­\n\ning income tax rate adjustments, especially in 2024, but also in \n\n2025 and 2026.\n\nThe measures that burden both household types per capita in­\n\nclude, above all, the expiry of the tax exemption for the inflation \n\ncompensation premium, but also the expiry of the electricity and \n\ngas price brakes. Additional burdens proportional to private house­\n\nhold income come from increasing the health and long-term care \n\ninsurances. Higher-income households will be burdened by the \n\nexpiry of the environmental bonus for electric vehicles and of the \n\nfourth Coronavirus Tax Relief Act, as well as by cuts to parental \n\nallowance (Elterngeld) for top earners. Companies will be subject \n\nto various kinds of sales tax cuts and the gas and electricity price \n\nbrake will end.\n\nOverall, fiscal policy measures will lower the income of private \n\nhouseholds by 0.04 percent in relation to GDP compared to the \n\nbase year of 2022 in 2024 and by 0.01 in both 2025 and 2026 \n\n(Table). The measures will dampen private consumption by 0.3 in \n\n2024 and by 0.4 in both 2025 and 2026, primarily due to the de­\n\ncline in consumption among low-income households. Investment \n\nwill fall by 0.4 percent in 2024 and by 0.5 and by 0.6 percent in \n\n2025 and 2026, respectively, as companies in particular are reduc­\n\ning their investment activity. Overall, restrictive fiscal stimuli will \n\nhave a negative impact of 0.06 and 0.05 percent on GDP in 2025 \n\nand 2026.\n\nTable\n\nStimuli from fiscal policy measures \n\nIn percent of GDP\n\n2024\n\n2025\n\n2026\n\nLow-income households\n\n0.03\n\n0.08\n\n0.08\n\nHigh-income households\n\n0.32\n\n0.48\n\n0.60\n\nPer capita\n\n−0.22\n\n−0.45\n\n−0.45\n\nProportionally\n\n−0.65\n\n−0.82\n\n−0.95\n\nCompanies\n\n−0.41\n\n−0.59\n\n−0.60\n\nGovernment\n\n0.18\n\n0.08\n\n0.14\n\nTotal\n\n−0.75\n\n−1.22\n\n−1.18\n\nSource: DIW Berlin Economic Outlook Autumn 2024.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\n234\n\nDIW Weekly Report 35–39/2024\n\nDIW BERLIN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK\n\n(such as those relating to agricultural diesel and support \n\nfor Ukraine), are also likely to outweigh expansionary stim­\n\nuli from the Growth Opportunities Act, the elimination of \n\nbracket creep, and the special fund for the Bundeswehr. In \n\n2026, the restrictive fiscal measures (increasing emissions \n\ntrading revenue, increasing social security contributions) \n\nare likely to be on par with the expansive fiscal policy effects, \n\nfor example through further income tax cuts and the exten­\n\nsion of degressive depreciation rules. Of the 49 measures \n\nfrom the German Federal Government’s recently announced \n\ngrowth initiative, this forecast only includes the Tax Reform \n\nAct (Steuerfortentwicklungsgesetz), for which a cabinet deci­\n\nsion has already been made. As it is expected that the meas­\n\nures will only gradually be implemented over the next two \n\nyears, the growth effect is likely to be positive, but small.7 \n\n7 Cf. VFA – Die forschenden Pharmaunternehmen, “Impulse der Wachstumsinitiative: Welche \n\nWirkungen dadurch möglich sind,” MacroScope Pharma 8 (2024) (in German; available online); \n\nBundesministerium für Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz, “Rohstoffstrategie der Bundesregierung. \n\nSchlaglichter der Wirtschaftspolitik,” Monatsbericht 8 (2024) (in German; available online).\n\nthe neutral rate of interest until mid-2025.6 Initially, fiscal \n\npolicy will be quite restrictive in the forecast period until \n\nexpansive and restrictive measures balance each other out \n\nagain in 2026. However, it is likely to have a negative effect \n\non GDP in 2025 and 2026, with the greatest burden being \n\nplaced on low-income households (Box 2). In 2024, this \n\nis primarily due to the expiry of measures that were initi­\n\nated to mitigate the energy crisis, as well as consolidation \n\nmeasures, such as cuts to the Climate and Transformation \n\nFund (Klima- und Transformationsfonds). There will be thus \n\nfewer expansive stimuli from the Growth Opportunities \n\nAct (Wachstumschancengesetz) as well as fewer adjustments \n\nto the income tax rate (Box 3). In 2025, restrictive meas­\n\nures, such as the end of the tax-free inflation compensa­\n\ntion premium as well as further consolidation measures \n\n6 The rate of neutral interest can only be estimated, not observed. According to estimates by \n\nthe European Central Bank, the nominal rate of neutral interest is between 1.25 and 2.7 percent if a \n\ntwo-percent inflation premium is added to the estimates of the real natural interest rate. Cf. Claus \n\nBrand, Noëmie Lisack, and Falk Mazelis, “Estimates of the natural interest rate for the euro area: an \n\nupdate,” ECB Economic Bulletin no. 1 (2024): 66–69.\n\nBox 3\n\nFiscal policy measure assumptions\n\nExpansive fiscal policy measures that were implemented during \n\nthe energy crisis and are now expiring are being followed by less \n\ncomprehensive new programs. Thus, there will be a considerable \n\nnegative fiscal stimulus (Table) this year.\n\nThe expiry of the electricity and gas price brakes as well as the end \n\nof aid for hospitals and care facilities as a part of the energy crisis \n\nhas the greatest impact. On the expenditure side, this is offset by \n\nadditional expenditure from the Climate and Transformation Fund \n\n(Klima- und Transformationsfonds, KTF) (promoting energy effi­\n\nciency in the building sector, subsidies for constructing refueling \n\nand charging infrastructure and the end of the EEG surcharge \n\nfor consumers) as well as expenditure from the special fund for \n\nthe Bundeswehr and support for Ukraine. These are significant in \n\nthemselves, but quantitatively smaller than the spending cuts.\n\nOn the income side of the government, the increase in the carbon \n\nprice and the truck toll as well as the increase in the air traffic tax will \n\nresult in more revenue for local authorities. A restrictive effect also \n\ncomes from the income side of social insurance. The increase in the \n\ncontribution rate for statutory long-term care insurance on July 1, \n\n2023, still has an impact this year. Moreover, it is assumed that the \n\nstate health insurance providers will slightly increase their supple­\n\nmental premium on average compared to 2023. As it is assumed \n\nthat the tax-free inflation compensation premium will account for a \n\nsmaller share of wage increases in 2024 compared to 2023, this will \n\nalso have a restrictive effect on household labor income. Overall, \n\nfiscal policy is likely to have a dampening effect on economic activity \n\nthis year with growth of 0.7 percent in relation to GDP.\n\nFiscal policy measures will be restrictive overall in 2025, too, as tax \n\nand duty increases will predominate on the income side and cuts \n\nwill have a greater impact than spending increases on the expend­\n\niture side. Overall, the budget impact of fiscal policy measures is \n\nlikely to amount to 0.4 percent of economic output in 2025.\n\nThe expiry of the inflation compensation premium, a further in­\n\ncrease in the carbon price, and any increases in social security \n\ncontribution rates result in higher revenue increases on the income \n\nside than adjustments to the income tax rate as part of the elimina­\n\ntion of bracket creep and tax breaks from the Growth Opportunities \n\nAct (Wachstumschancengesetz) will reduce government revenue. \n\nOn the expenditure side, the introduction of the basic child security, \n\na further increase to the child benefit, the measures included in the \n\nLong-Term Care Support and Relief Act (Pflegeunterstützungs- und \n\nEntlastungsgesetz), and further additional expenditure on defense \n\nwill likely provide stimulating effects. In contrast, cuts to support to \n\nUkraine as well as to the KTF mean that overall expenditure will be \n\nlower than in 2024 and thus have a restrictive fiscal effect.\n\nIn 2026, fiscal policy measures will balance each other out, result­\n\ning in an effect of zero in relation to GDP. Primarily adjustments to \n\nthe income tax rates, such as the elimination of bracket creep, will \n\nlead to a reduction in government revenue, which in turn increases \n\nthe income of private households and thus has an expansionary \n\neffect. The collective depreciation reform as well as the extension \n\nof the degressive depreciation for assets also contribute to the \n\nexpansive nature of the income side.

Thus, DIW Berlin is lowering \n\nits forecast for 2024 by 0.3 percentage points and for 2025 \n\nby 0.4 percentage points compared to the summer forecast. \n\nThe forecast was revised downward primarily due to a revi­\n\nsion of the reported data and the significantly weaker indica­\n\ntors for the German and global economy over the summer.\n\nDue to ongoing weak investment and declining labor force \n\npotential, potential GDP is likely to continue to develop slug­\n\ngishly until the end of 2029. The labor volume in particu­\n\nlar will decline as a result of the aging population. In light \n\nof the stagnation this year, the output gap is likely to grow \n\nand amount to -1.9 percent of potential GDP on average for \n\n2024. With the recovery over the coming years, the output \n\ngap should then shrink to -0.6 percent at the end of the short \n\nterm and close in 2029.\n\nAverage consumer price inflation should be 2.2 percent in \n\n2024. In 2025 and 2026, it will likely level off at the ECB's \n\ntwo-percent inflation target. Thus, the inflation expectation \n\nfor 2024 is slightly lower compared to summer, while it \n\nremains unchanged for 2025. The core rate, inflation exclud­\n\ning energy and food, is expected to average three percent in \n\n2024 due to continuous strong price increases for services. \n\nIt will also reach the two-percent target over the course of \n\nthe forecast.\n\nIn addition to the global risks that are creating uncertainty for \n\nthe outlook of the German economy, there are also domes­\n\ntic risk factors. Above all, this includes political uncertainty, \n\nwhich is currently close to its all-time high according to the \n\nEconomic Policy Uncertainty Index. Although the German \n\nFederal Government was recently able to agree on a draft \n\nbudget for 2025, there are still concerns that the coalition \n\nparties—which are pursuing different objectives in many \n\nareas—are to a certain extent unable to take action. This \n\nmakes for an unclear economic policy framework, which \n\ncould more negatively impact the domestic economy than \n\nassumed in this forecast.\n\nThe recent results of the state elections in Thuringia and \n\nSaxony and the rise of the populist forces there also pose \n\nan additional risk. These results could increase the skilled \n\nworker shortage and reduce Germany’s attractiveness as an \n\neconomic location.\n\nIn addition, right-wing and left-wing populist parties could \n\nperform well in the upcoming 2025 Bundestag elections and \n\nincrease uncertainty with regard to the subsequent forma­\n\ntion of a government.\n\nFigure 6\n\nStructural primary balance\n\nIn percent (in relation to nominal production potential)\n\n \n\nNote: The structural primary balance is the sum of the columns.

After i appeared \n\nto finally be growing a he star of 2024, i experienced a sligh \n\nsetback in he second quarter. Although incomes are rising \n\nand inflation is now near he wo-percen arget, people in Ger­\n\nmany are saving heir money. As investments and exports fal­\n\ntered due o he sluggish industrial sector, he upturn has been \n\ndelayed for he ime being. Overall economic outpu is likely o \n\nstagnate in 2024, bu i will likely pick up a he end of he year; \n\ngrowth of 0.9 and 1.4 percen is expected in 2025 and 2026, \n\nrespectively. Private consumption, which will increase more \n\nslowly han expected bu still provide a stimulating effect, will \n\nprimarily suppor his growth. As interes rates continue o fall \n\nworldwide, foreign rade and investments are also supporting \n\ngrowth. The global economy has returned o its recovery path, \n\nbu expanded more weakly in he second quarter compared \n\nto he first. Growth in China in particular has stalled somewhat, \n\nand here are also signs of an upcoming economic slowdown \n\nin he United States. Following growth of 3.8 percen in 2024, \n\nthe global economy is expected o expand by only 3.5 percen \n\nin 2025, bu develop more dynamically again in 2026.\n\nGlobal economy: recovery expected o continue, \n\nwhile he US economy cools off\n\nThe global economy weakened in he second quarter of 2024. \n\nFollowing a 1.0-percen increase in he firs quarter, i only \n\ngrew by 0.7 percen in he second (Figure 1). Growth stalled \n\nin he emerging economies in particular; his was due o he \n\ndevelopmen in China, where domestic demand remained \n\nweak. In contrast, a bi more momentum came from he \n\nadvanced economies, especially he United States and he \n\neuro area, where inflation rates continued o decline. This \n\nresulted in a firs interes rate cu in he euro area in June.\n\nCarried by consumption and exports, he advanced econo­\n\nmies expanded by 0.6 percen in he second quarter. The euro \n\narea economy remained on its recovery path and grew again \n\nby 0.3 percent. Foreign rade in particular made a positive \n\ncontribution o growth due o rising exports. Spain (0.8 per­\n\ncent) and he Netherlands (1.0 percent) provided particularly \n\nstrong suppor for he economic recovery in he euro area. \n\nFrance and Italy also recorded positive quarterly growth in \n\nthe second quarter, with 0.3 percen each. Germany was he \n\nonly major euro area country o make a negative contribu­\n\ntion o growth with -0.1 percent. In he United Kingdom, \n\neconomic outpu continued o rise significantly by 0.6 per­\n\ncent, supported primarily by a strong increase in inventories.\n\nThe US economy also experienced strong growth of 0.7 per­\n\ncen in he second quarter, still driven by robus consumer \n\nspending and corporate investments. In contras o its neg­\n\native star o he year, Japan's GDP expanded by 0.8 percent. \n\nTax relief and real wage growth as a resul of larger wage \n\nincreases have spurred private consumption.\n\nAmong he emerging economies, which expanded by 0.8 per­\n\ncen overall, only China performed poorly: The Chinese econ­\n\nomy grew by merely 0.7 percen in he second quarter, com­\n\npared o a strong 1,5 percen in he first. Negative factors, such \n\nas he still struggling real estate market, subdued domestic \n\ndemand, and severe storms and flooding dampened growth, \n\nwhile fiscal and monetary policy measures only had a limited \n\n225\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 35–39/2024\n\nDIW BERLIN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK\n\nimpac on he problems in he real estate market.1 In contrast, \n\nstrong foreign demand and governmen investments in he \n\nhigh-tech sector contributed positively o growth. The Indian \n\neconomy continued o expand hanks o strong domestic \n\neconomic activity. The Mexican and Brazilian economies \n\ncontinued o grow, although momentum is slowing some­\n\nwhat. Restrictive monetary policy had an impac in hese \n\ncountries and he expor sector fel he effects of he weaker \n\nglobal economy. Poland stands ou among he Central and \n\nSoutheastern European countries with impressive quarterly \n\ngrowth of 1.5 percent.\n\nIn he curren hird quarter, mos advanced economies are \n\nexpected o contribute a bi less o he recovery han pre­\n\nviously. In particular, he US economy is likely o contrac \n\nslightly as a resul of less dynamic consumption and a dete­\n\nriorating situation in he labor market. By contrast, he euro \n\narea economy withou Germany is likely o continue its recov­\n\nery path. Steady growth in real wages will probably strengthen \n\ndomestic demand. No momentum is expected from he \n\neuro area industry: While he Manufacturing Purchasing \n\nManagers' Indices (PMI) of he individual euro area coun­\n\ntries in he firs half of 2024 still showed signs of recovery, \n\nthey have been declining again since June. Companies are \n\npessimistic in erms of political uncertainty (France), declin­\n\ning orders and rising prices for intermediary goods and \n\nlabor costs (Spain, Netherlands, Italy). The outlook is also \n\ndeteriorating in mos Member States in he services sector, \n\nbu he indices remain above he expansion hreshold. The \n\nmood has improved in France due o he Olympic Games. \n\nThe outlook for he hird quarter for he United Kingdom \n\nis good: Both he upward rend in he PMIs in all economic \n\nsectors and he rise in consumer confidence poin o a fur­\n\nther recovery. Real wage increases are likely o continue \n\nboosting consumption. In Japan, he recovery in domestic \n\ndemand is providing sligh growth stimuli in he hird quar­\n\nter. A he same ime, here are also only very weak signals \n\nfor a recovery in he Japanese manufacturing industries; he \n\nPMI has been stuck below he expansion hreshold of 50 for \n\ntwo months in a row.\n\nGrowth is expected o be stronger in he emerging econo­\n\nmies in he hird quarter han in he second quarter. The \n\nIndian economy should continue o grow dynamically. The \n\nChinese economy is likely o benefi from rising exports and \n\ninvestments in he high-tech sector. Despite all he stimulat­\n\ning monetary and fiscal policy measures, domestic demand \n\nis likely o continue o suffer from he problems on he real \n\nestate market, which puts into question he Chinese govern­\n\nment's annual growth arge of five percen for 2024.\n\nDespite still pending or already initiated interes rate cuts, \n\nmonetary policy in he advanced economies is likely o \n\nremain restrictive. The neutral rate of interes will prob­\n\nably be reached by he end of 2025 in many places. The \n\n1 \n\nCf.

The ongoing global \n\nindustrial weakness in he advanced economies will likely \n\nstill weigh on international rade in 2025. Falling interes \n\nrates, however, should revive corporate investment, and hus \n\nalso international rade, from mid 2025.\n\nOver he res of he forecas period, global growth rates are \n\nexpected o be muted in 2025 before becoming more dynamic \n\nin 2026 (Table 1). In winter 2024/2025, inflation rates in \n\nmany places will reach he arge corridor of he central \n\nbanks. As interes rates fall, monetary policy in mos econ­\n\nomies will switch from a restrictive policy o a more neu­\n\ntral one by he end of 2025, hereby supporting economic \n\nBox 1\n\nAssumptions and framework conditions\n\nThis forecas is based on he following assumptions abou he \n\nfurther developmen of key interes rates, exchange rates, and \n\ncommodity prices (Table). These assumptions were made based \n\non previous development, futures markets prices, and he closing \n\nprices on he date of his forecas (Augus 19, 2024). The European \n\nCentral Bank (ECB) firs decreased interes rates in June. After \n\na year of stable interes rates, i has now initiated a urnaround. \n\nSix further interes rate cuts are assumed over he forecas hori­\n\nzon, which are likely o ake place a every second ECB meeting. \n\nSpecifically, i is assumed ha he ECB will cu interes rates for he \n\nsecond ime in September, again by 25 basis points. A he same \n\ntime, he Central Bank will, as announced, decrease he interes \n\nrate corridor between he main refinancing rate and he deposi \n\nrate from 50 o 15 basis points. For some ime now, he ECB has \n\nbeen steering he economy via he deposi rate and no he main \n\nrefinancing rate. The deposi rate is hus he key indicator for inter­\n\nes rate changes. The subsequen interes rate cuts are assumed \n\nto be 25 basis points each, which results in a reduction of he de­\n\nposi rate by 75 basis points in both 2024 and 2025.\n\nMoney marke interes rates fell a he beginning of 2024 in antic­\n\nipation of he interes rate urnaround. I is assumed ha hese, in \n\nline with key interes rates, will continue o fall over he forecas \n\nhorizon. The refinancing costs for households and companies are \n\nlikely o decline as key interes rates fall over he coming years. \n\nThe return on governmen bonds increased again slightly fol­\n\nlowing a brief decline a he beginning of 2024. I is assumed ha \n\ncapital marke interes rates will remain largely unchanged over \n\nthe forecas horizon a 2.4 percen for Germany and 3.1 percen \n\nfor he euro area. The euro has recently depreciated agains he \n\nUS dollar due o he interes rate differential. For he forecas peri­\n\nod, i is assumed ha he exchange rate of EUR o USD will remain \n\na 1.09 USD per EUR.\n\nUncertainties abou he gas supply in he coming year resulted \n\nin sligh increases in he wholesale price for gas (TTF) recently. \n\nHowever, well-filled gas storage facilities should preven a severe \n\nsupply shortage. According o futures, he average gas price \n\nshould be around 34.50 (2024), 41.90 (2025), and 35.70 euros \n\n(2026) per megawa hours. The price for Bren crude oil will de­\n\ncline slightly over he forecas horizon according o raded futures. \n\nIn 2024, he average price is likely o be 84,60 USD per barrel be­\n\nfore i declines o an average of 76,70 USD per barrel in 2025 and \n\nfinally o 73,70 USD per barrel in 2026. This forecas is also based \n\non political assumptions: We assume ha no further escalations \n\nwill occur, bu also ha none of he curren geopolitical crises, such \n\nas he Israeli-Hamas War, he Russo-Ukrainian War, and he con­\n\nflic between China and Taiwan, will end.\n\nTable\n\nForecas assumptions\n\n2023\n\n2024\n\n2025\n\n2026\n\nECB deposi rate1 (year end)\n\nPercent\n\n4.0\n\n3.25\n\n2.5\n\n2.5\n\nMoney marke interes rate\n\nThree-month EURIBOR in percent\n\n3.4\n\n3.5\n\n2.4\n\n2.2\n\nCapital marke interest\n\nYield on euro-area governmen bonds with \n\na remaining erm of en years\n\n3.3\n\n3.1\n\n3.1\n\n3.1\n\nCapital marke interest\n\nYield on German governmen bonds with a \n\nremaining erm of en years\n\n2.6\n\n2.5\n\n2.4\n\n2.4\n\nExchange rate\n\nUSD/EUR\n\n1.08\n\n1.09\n\n1.09\n\n1.09\n\nCrude oil price\n\nUSD per barrel\n\n82.5\n\n82.6\n\n76.7\n\n73.7\n\nGas price\n\nEUR per megawa hour\n\n42.1\n\n34.5\n\n41.9\n\n35.7\n\n1 The ECB steers he economy via he deposi rate, no he key interes rate.\n\nNote: Annual average unless indicated otherwise. \n\nSources: European Central Bank; European Money Markets Institute (EMMI); Eurex Exchange; Deutsche Bundesbank; \n\nFederal Reserve; Energy Information Administration (EIA); Intercontinental Exchange (ICE); CME Group; DIW Berlin \n\nEconomic Forecas Autumn 2024.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\n227\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 35–39/2024\n\nDIW BERLIN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK\n\ndevelopment, especially corporate investmen and con­\n\nstruction.

The previous invest­\n\nment-driven growth model seems o have reached its lim­\n\nits and has no been replaced by private consumption so far.\n\nOn an annual average, he advanced economies are expected \n\nto expand by only 1.7 percen in 2024, while economic out­\n\npu will likely increase by 4.9 percen in he emerging econ­\n\nomies. Overall, he global economy is expected o grow by \n\n3.8 percen in 2024, 0.1 percentage points more han fore­\n\ncas in summer. In 2025, global growth is likely o be some­\n\nwha weaker a 3.5 percent, due o he US economy cooling \n\ndown, before growing more dynamically again by 3.7 per­\n\ncen in 2026. Thus, he forecas for 2025 is 0.1 percentage \n\npoints less han expected in summer.\n\nThis forecas is subjec o many uncertainty factors. For \n\nexample, he inflation rates, especially in he United States \n\nand he euro area, could decline more slowly han expected, \n\nwhich would resul in a longer phase of restrictive mone­\n\ntary policy and hus dampen economic growth. If inflation \n\nfell more quickly, in contrast, i could suppor consumption \n\nmore and lead o more rapid interes rate cuts. Geopolitical \n\nrisks remain quite high. The war in he Middle Eas could \n\nescalate further, which would likely lead o higher oil and \n\nnatural gas prices. The war in Ukraine, he developmen of \n\nwhich is difficul o predict, is a further risk.

Following a sligh 0.2 percen increase in GDP a \n\nthe beginning of he year, his positive developmen did no \n\ncontinue: Economic outpu contracted slightly by 0.1 percen \n\nin he second quarter (Figure 33). A recovery failed o materi­\n\nalize. On he one hand, private household consumption was \n\nsignificantly lower han he increase in disposable income \n\nsince he energy crisis had suggested. On he other hand, \n\ninvestments in equipmen and in construction slumped and \n\nexports declined, probably primarily due o persisten low \n\ndomestic and foreign demand for industrial goods.\n\nPrivate consumption contracted somewha in he second \n\nquarter: Private households seem o be unse led, both due \n\nto he political and economic conditions as well as he low \n\nbu steady rise in unemployment. This likely resulted in \n\nconsumers consuming less in he second quarter han hey \n\ndid a he beginning of he year, despite strong increases in \n\nreal wages. In line with his, private households are saving \n\na bi more of heir income: A 10.8 percent, he savings rate \n\nis currently slightly higher han in 2023.4 Consumer senti­\n\nmen is dampened, likely due o he high price level. While \n\ninflation has stabilized noticeably recently and consistently \n\nbeen under hree percen since he beginning of 2024, core \n\ninflation and he price increases in he services sector in par­\n\nticular have remained elevated, likely having curbed con­\n\nsumption. As expected in early summer, he UEFA European \n\nMen’s Football Championship did no noticeably boos pri­\n\nvate consumption in Germany.\n\nForeign rade also did no provide any growth stimuli in \n\nthe second quarter. While strong exports of intermediate \n\ngoods, such as chemical and plastic products, had indicated \n\na recovery in he global industry5 and hus German rade \n\na he beginning of he year, exports of hese goods signifi­\n\ncantly declined again in he second quarter. Although ravel \n\nboosted service exports, i was unable o preven he decline \n\nin exports overall. Service imports also experienced strong \n\ngrowth, while goods imports fell slightly. Overall, imports \n\nstagnated, resulting in a slightly negative balance of exports \n\nand imports in he second quarter.\n\nThe decline in investments was even greater. Particularly pri­\n\nvate investmen in equipmen suffered a serious slump; in \n\nthe second quarter, i was a its lowes level since he produc­\n\ntion restrictions during he coronavirus pandemic. In con­\n\ntrast, public equipmen investmen had a stimulating effect. \n\nThe downward rend of recen years also continued in con­\n\nstruction investment, which declined significantly, mainly \n\nin residential and public construction.\n\n3 Detailed figures on he forecas for he Germany economy can be found in he online appendix \n\n(in German).\n\n4 The general revision of he VGR data results in he savings rate for Germany being revised \n\ndownward significantly. Until recently, he data showed a significantly higher savings rate level \n\nthan was he case before he coronavirus pandemic.\n\n5 For more, see he section on he global economy in his Weekly Report.\n\nThe evolution of gross value added (GVA) in he second quar­\n\nter shows ha he gap between he services and manufactur­\n\ning sectors is growing. Overall, GVA declined by 0.1 percent, \n\nthe same rate as GDP. While production declined slightly in \n\nmanufacturing, i plummeted in he construction industry. \n\nAs a result, he manufacturing industry as a whole reduced \n\nGVA by 0.3 percent. Services increased slightly, supporting \n\nGVA by 0.1 percent. However, i was a mixed picture in he \n\nindividual economic sectors. Value added in he consum­\n\ner-related sectors decreased, while business-related services \n\nwere able o expand heir production. This developmen in \n\nvalue added is also reflected in he lates labor marke figures: \n\nemploymen has continued o rise overall, albei a a slightly \n\nslower rate han a he beginning of he year. Employmen \n\nexpanded in he services sector bu declined in he ailing \n\nmanufacturing industry as well as construction. Overall, \n\nhowever, he labor marke has so far remained stable, even \n\nif unemploymen is rising.\n\nStagnation expected in he hird quarter for he \n\nGerman economy\n\nThe recovery of he German economy is likely o remain \n\nelusive in he curren hird quarter; GDP is no projected \n\nto increase (Table 2). Private consumption is still projected \n\nto expand, although less powerfully han was implied in \n\nspring (Figure 4).

A he same ime, he strong real wage \n\nincreases since mid-2023 have extensively compensated for \n\nthe losses during he energy crisis and are expected o suppor \n\nconsumption in he second half of 2024. Low-income house­\n\nholds have likely continued o experience strong income \n\ngrowth recently, which should benefi private consump­\n\ntion, as hese households have a higher propensity o con­\n\nsume. Income for higher income groups, in contrast, has \n\nincreased somewha less strongly han previously. As a result, \n\nlabor income inequality should remain he same his year \n\n(Figure 5). Additionally, consumer price inflation is contin­\n\nually declining, and—especially hanks o decreasing energy \n\nprices—fell below he wo-percen arge for he firs ime \n\nsince March 2021 in August 2024, bringing he annual aver­\n\nage closer o he inflation arge of he European Central Bank \n\n(ECB). Leading price indicators such as impor and whole­\n\nsale prices also sugges his. Although some of hese indi­\n\ncators are rising again, he rates remain well below wo per­\n\ncent. Stable price developmen should strengthen consumer \n\nconfidence once more and stimulate private consumption. \n\nRobus employmen expansion, which he services sector \n\nwill likely continue o drive, should also suppor private con­\n\nsumption. Cyclical unemploymen is expected o continue \n\nto rise slightly due o weak economic developmen (Table 3).\n\nInvestments are expected o make a negative contribution o \n\neconomic growth again in he curren quarter. Investmen \n\nin equipmen continues o suffer due o weak industrial pro­\n\nduction and a lack of demand; he stock of existing orders is \n\nshrinking while new orders are faltering. In construction, \n\ndespite he initiated interes rate shift, he persistently high \n\ninteres rates and he high and continuously rising construc­\n\ntion costs remain he key obstacles and are likely o further \n\nslow down residential construction in he second half of he \n\nyear. Although he volume of new residential construction \n\nloans has increased somewha again recently, his is no ye \n\nreflected in he approval and order figures. Corporate capac­\n\nity utilization in building construction recently declined o \n\nits lowes value since 2010. In contrast, civil engineering is \n\nexpected o continue o suppor construction investment.\n\nThe demand from abroad for German intermediate and capi­\n\ntal goods is also likely o remain weak in he curren quarter. \n\nThe ifo Expor Expectations fell for he hird ime in a row in \n\nAugust; hus, another decline in goods exports is expected \n\nfor he hird quarter. Service exports, which make up a good \n\n20 percen of German foreign rade, should expand further \n\ndue o he growing importance of he domestic and foreign \n\nservice sectors.

Although sentimen in both sectors has recently \n\ndeteriorated somewha according o he Purchasing \n\nManager Indices for Germany, sentimen remains more \n\nrobus and above he expansion hreshold of 50 points in \n\nthe services sector, supported by growing demand. In he \n\nindustrial sector, in contrast, he index is consistently below \n\nthe expansion hreshold. According o he ifo Business \n\nClimate Index survey in August, he business climate in \n\nthe industrial sector has fallen for he hird ime in a row, \n\nwith he respondents rating both he curren situation and \n\nfuture business as critical. The lack of orders is increas­\n\ningly becoming a problem and will likely impede produc­\n\ntion in he curren quarter.\n\nGradual recovery over he course of he forecast\n\nThe German economy is expected o recover over he course \n\nof he forecast, although more sluggishly han he indica­\n\ntors suggested during he summer. In erms of he domes­\n\ntic economy, he positive real wage rend, which should be \n\nsupported by low inflation rates and continue hroughou he \n\nforecas period, is likely o have he greates impac initially. \n\nWhile employees’ bargaining power has weakened somewha \n\nwith he sligh decline in he Labor Shortage Index, he col­\n\nlective wage negotiations planned for he end of 2024, such \n\nas in he public sector as well as he metalworking and elec­\n\ntrical industry, are expected o resul in further strong nom­\n\ninal wage increases. Unemploymen will reach its peak a \n\nthe beginning of 2025 and decline as he economy recovers \n\nand integration processes, particularly of Ukrainian refu­\n\ngees, progress. This developmen benefits private consump­\n\ntion, which is expected o suppor economic outpu a he \n\nturn of he year. Governmen consumption should continue \n\nto contribute positively o GDP. Expenditure on a moderate \n\nincrease in employmen in he public sector is likely o sup­\n\npor growth in 2024 and 2025, while social benefits in kind, \n\nparticularly in he areas of health and care services, will prob­\n\nably be expanded hroughou he forecas period.\n\nGerman foreign rade is no expected o noticeably increase \n\nagain until 2025. Supported by falling interes rates world­\n\nwide and a gradual upturn in investmen activity abroad, \n\ndemand for German industrial goods should rekindle. \n\nHowever, German goods exports are unlikely o expand as \n\ndynamically as in he pas due o strong competition from \n\nChina. As a result, he share of services of otal exports should \n\nincrease further over he forecas horizon. Goods imports \n\nwill likely benefi from he recovery of he expor business \n\nand he improvemen in German industrial production and \n\npick up. As German exports of industrial and capital goods \n\nshould be somewha weaker, goods imports will probably \n\nexceed exports in relative erms. This results in a slightly \n\nnegative rade balance for he German economy in both \n\n2025 and 2026 (Table 4).\n\nRising foreign demand should boos private equipmen \n\ninvestmen again from he second half of 2025.

The pub­\n\nlic sector will continue o suppor equipmen investment, \n\nin particular with he special fund for he German armed \n\nforces (Sondervermögen Bundeswehr), which should lead o \n\na significan increase in public spending. Construction \n\ninvestments will no pick up until he second half of 2025, \n\nwhen construction costs will gradually stabilize. This is \n\ndecisive for residential construction in particular, which \n\nshould no pick up until 2026. In contrast, investmen in \n\nnon-residential construction is likely o expand continu­\n\nously, with civil engineering in particular continuing o \n\ndrive he positive rend.\n\nDespite falling interes rates, monetary policy will initially \n\nremain restrictive and is no expected o reach he range of \n\nBox 2\n\nImpac of fiscal policy measures on private consumption and GDP\n\nFiscal policy measures in 2024 and 2025 will be restrictive overall \n\nand are expected o contrac by 0.7 and 0.4 percen of GDP year-\n\non-year. In 2026, fiscal policy will become neutral again. In accord­\n\nance with fiscal policy assumptions, he majority of he Federal \n\nGovernment's growth initiative measures are no considered here.\n\nThe majority of fiscal measures affec private households. A DSGE \n\nmodel with wo differen household ypes (TANK model) is used o \n\nestimate he stimulating effec of private consumption and GDP \n\nwhile accounting for heir distributional effects. To his end, a dis­\n\ntinction is firs made between he exten o which he measures \n\naffec he lowest-income 40 percen of households and how he \n\nremaining households benefi or are negatively affected.\n\nThe 40 percen with he lowes incomes earn around 20 percen of \n\ntotal disposable income and have a savings rate of zero, which is \n\nwhy hey are referred o as liquidity-constrained (LC) households. \n\nIn addition o private households, here are he measures ha af­\n\nfec companies or he Federal Government. Fiscal policy measures \n\nare divided into six categories according o heir impac on he wo \n\nhousehold ypes and other actors:\n\n1. Measures ha affec LC households only\n\n2. Measures ha affec all households per capita\n\n3. Measures ha affec all households proportionally o \n\ntheir income\n\n4. Measures ha affec high-income households only\n\n5. Measures ha affec companies (differentiated by effec on \n\nprofits and subsidies)\n\n6. Measures ha affec he government\n\nSince he wo household ypes differ in heir consumption behav­\n\nior, he consumption effec will be highes for low-income house­\n\nholds in particular and decline over he other hree categories. \n\nSome of he measures ha will relieve low-income households in \n\nparticular are he basic income (Bürgergeld) and housing bene­\n\nfits (Wohngeld) reforms in 2024 and he introduction of he basic \n\nchild benefi in 2025. Moreover, he change o he basic pension \n\nfrom 2024 should suppor low-income households. High-income \n\nhouseholds are likely o benefi from he Inflationsausgleichgesetz \n\n(Inflation Adjustmen Act) and, in particular, from he correspond­\n\ning income ax rate adjustments, especially in 2024, bu also in \n\n2025 and 2026.\n\nThe measures ha burden both household ypes per capita in­\n\nclude, above all, he expiry of he ax exemption for he inflation \n\ncompensation premium, bu also he expiry of he electricity and \n\ngas price brakes. Additional burdens proportional o private house­\n\nhold income come from increasing he health and long-term care \n\ninsurances. Higher-income households will be burdened by he \n\nexpiry of he environmental bonus for electric vehicles and of he \n\nfourth Coronavirus Tax Relief Act, as well as by cuts o parental \n\nallowance (Elterngeld) for op earners. Companies will be subjec \n\nto various kinds of sales ax cuts and he gas and electricity price \n\nbrake will end.\n\nOverall, fiscal policy measures will lower he income of private \n\nhouseholds by 0.04 percen in relation o GDP compared o he \n\nbase year of 2022 in 2024 and by 0.01 in both 2025 and 2026 \n\n(Table). The measures will dampen private consumption by 0.3 in \n\n2024 and by 0.4 in both 2025 and 2026, primarily due o he de­\n\ncline in consumption among low-income households. Investmen \n\nwill fall by 0.4 percen in 2024 and by 0.5 and by 0.6 percen in \n\n2025 and 2026, respectively, as companies in particular are reduc­\n\ning heir investmen activity. Overall, restrictive fiscal stimuli will \n\nhave a negative impac of 0.06 and 0.05 percen on GDP in 2025 \n\nand 2026.\n\nTable\n\nStimuli from fiscal policy measures \n\nIn percen of GDP\n\n2024\n\n2025\n\n2026\n\nLow-income households\n\n0.03\n\n0.08\n\n0.08\n\nHigh-income households\n\n0.32\n\n0.48\n\n0.60\n\nPer capita\n\n−0.22\n\n−0.45\n\n−0.45\n\nProportionally\n\n−0.65\n\n−0.82\n\n−0.95\n\nCompanies\n\n−0.41\n\n−0.59\n\n−0.60\n\nGovernment\n\n0.18\n\n0.08\n\n0.14\n\nTotal\n\n−0.75\n\n−1.22\n\n−1.18\n\nSource: DIW Berlin Economic Outlook Autumn 2024.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\n234\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 35–39/2024\n\nDIW BERLIN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK\n\n(such as hose relating o agricultural diesel and suppor \n\nfor Ukraine), are also likely o outweigh expansionary stim­\n\nuli from he Growth Opportunities Act, he elimination of \n\nbracke creep, and he special fund for he Bundeswehr.

In 2025, restrictive meas­\n\nures, such as he end of he ax-free inflation compensa­\n\ntion premium as well as further consolidation measures \n\n6 The rate of neutral interes can only be estimated, no observed. According o estimates by \n\nthe European Central Bank, he nominal rate of neutral interes is between 1.25 and 2.7 percen if a \n\ntwo-percen inflation premium is added o he estimates of he real natural interes rate. Cf.

Thus, here will be a considerable \n\nnegative fiscal stimulus (Table) his year.\n\nThe expiry of he electricity and gas price brakes as well as he end \n\nof aid for hospitals and care facilities as a par of he energy crisis \n\nhas he greates impact. On he expenditure side, his is offse by \n\nadditional expenditure from he Climate and Transformation Fund \n\n(Klima- und Transformationsfonds, KTF) (promoting energy effi­\n\nciency in he building sector, subsidies for constructing refueling \n\nand charging infrastructure and he end of he EEG surcharge \n\nfor consumers) as well as expenditure from he special fund for \n\nthe Bundeswehr and suppor for Ukraine. These are significan in \n\nthemselves, bu quantitatively smaller han he spending cuts.\n\nOn he income side of he government, he increase in he carbon \n\nprice and he ruck oll as well as he increase in he air raffic ax will \n\nresul in more revenue for local authorities. A restrictive effec also \n\ncomes from he income side of social insurance. The increase in he \n\ncontribution rate for statutory long-term care insurance on July 1, \n\n2023, still has an impac his year. Moreover, i is assumed ha he \n\nstate health insurance providers will slightly increase heir supple­\n\nmental premium on average compared o 2023. As i is assumed \n\ntha he ax-free inflation compensation premium will accoun for a \n\nsmaller share of wage increases in 2024 compared o 2023, his will \n\nalso have a restrictive effec on household labor income. Overall, \n\nfiscal policy is likely o have a dampening effec on economic activity \n\nthis year with growth of 0.7 percen in relation o GDP.\n\nFiscal policy measures will be restrictive overall in 2025, oo, as ax \n\nand duty increases will predominate on he income side and cuts \n\nwill have a greater impac han spending increases on he expend­\n\niture side. Overall, he budge impac of fiscal policy measures is \n\nlikely o amoun o 0.4 percen of economic outpu in 2025.\n\nThe expiry of he inflation compensation premium, a further in­\n\ncrease in he carbon price, and any increases in social security \n\ncontribution rates resul in higher revenue increases on he income \n\nside han adjustments o he income ax rate as par of he elimina­\n\ntion of bracke creep and ax breaks from he Growth Opportunities \n\nAc (Wachstumschancengesetz) will reduce governmen revenue. \n\nOn he expenditure side, he introduction of he basic child security, \n\na further increase o he child benefit, he measures included in he \n\nLong-Term Care Suppor and Relief Ac (Pflegeunterstützungs- und \n\nEntlastungsgesetz), and further additional expenditure on defense \n\nwill likely provide stimulating effects. In contrast, cuts o suppor o \n\nUkraine as well as o he KTF mean ha overall expenditure will be \n\nlower han in 2024 and hus have a restrictive fiscal effect.\n\nIn 2026, fiscal policy measures will balance each other out, result­\n\ning in an effec of zero in relation o GDP. Primarily adjustments o \n\nthe income ax rates, such as he elimination of bracke creep, will \n\nlead o a reduction in governmen revenue, which in urn increases \n\nthe income of private households and hus has an expansionary \n\neffect. The collective depreciation reform as well as he extension \n\nof he degressive depreciation for assets also contribute o he \n\nexpansive nature of he income side.

Thus, DIW Berlin is lowering \n\nits forecas for 2024 by 0.3 percentage points and for 2025 \n\nby 0.4 percentage points compared o he summer forecast. \n\nThe forecas was revised downward primarily due o a revi­\n\nsion of he reported data and he significantly weaker indica­\n\ntors for he German and global economy over he summer.\n\nDue o ongoing weak investmen and declining labor force \n\npotential, potential GDP is likely o continue o develop slug­\n\ngishly until he end of 2029. The labor volume in particu­\n\nlar will decline as a resul of he aging population. In ligh \n\nof he stagnation his year, he outpu gap is likely o grow \n\nand amoun o -1.9 percen of potential GDP on average for \n\n2024. With he recovery over he coming years, he outpu \n\ngap should hen shrink o -0.6 percen a he end of he shor \n\nterm and close in 2029.\n\nAverage consumer price inflation should be 2.2 percen in \n\n2024. In 2025 and 2026, i will likely level off a he ECB's \n\ntwo-percen inflation arget. Thus, he inflation expectation \n\nfor 2024 is slightly lower compared o summer, while i \n\nremains unchanged for 2025. The core rate, inflation exclud­\n\ning energy and food, is expected o average hree percen in \n\n2024 due o continuous strong price increases for services. \n\nI will also reach he wo-percen arge over he course of \n\nthe forecast.\n\nIn addition o he global risks ha are creating uncertainty for \n\nthe outlook of he German economy, here are also domes­\n\ntic risk factors. Above all, his includes political uncertainty, \n\nwhich is currently close o its all-time high according o he \n\nEconomic Policy Uncertainty Index. Although he German \n\nFederal Governmen was recently able o agree on a draf \n\nbudge for 2025, here are still concerns ha he coalition \n\nparties—which are pursuing differen objectives in many \n\nareas—are o a certain exten unable o ake action. This \n\nmakes for an unclear economic policy framework, which \n\ncould more negatively impac he domestic economy han \n\nassumed in his forecast.\n\nThe recen results of he state elections in Thuringia and \n\nSaxony and he rise of he populis forces here also pose \n\nan additional risk. These results could increase he skilled \n\nworker shortage and reduce Germany’s a ractiveness as an \n\neconomic location.\n\nIn addition, right-wing and left-wing populis parties could \n\nperform well in he upcoming 2025 Bundestag elections and \n\nincrease uncertainty with regard o he subsequen forma­\n\ntion of a government.\n\nFigure 6\n\nStructural primary balance\n\nIn percen (in relation o nominal production potential)\n\n \n\nNote: The structural primary balance is he sum of he columns.
