DIW Weekly Report 1+2 2024 AT A GLANCE Decline in nominal construction volume expected for he firs ime since he financial crisis; residential construction situation worsening By Martin Gornig and Laura Pagenhardt • Falling construction prices will cause construction volume o decline by 3.5 percen in nominal terms and by 1.5 percen in real erms in 2024 • Residential construction is declining markedly, more so in new construction han in renovation • Goal of constructing 400,000 residences per year becoming more ou of reach • Only civil engineering is cushioning he downturn and will increase again in 2025 • The situation is expected o stabilize in 2025 MEDIA Audio Interview with Laura Pagenhard (in German) www.diw.de/mediathek FROM THE AUTHORS “To provide he construction industry with some momentum again, i is very importan for policy makers o deal with he uncertainty regarding subsidy programs as soon as possible. This includes he subsidy program for energy-efficien building renovation, bu also new residential construction.” — Laura Pagenhard — 2024 even weaker han 2023: Worsening crisis in residential construction, while civil engineering cushions he downturn Real change in construction volume in percen compared o previous year 4 DIW Weekly Repor 1+2/2024 DOI: h ps://doi.org/10.18723/diw_dwr:2024-1-1 CONSTRUCTION VOLUME CALCULATION Decline in nominal construction volume expected for he firs ime since he financial crisis; residential construction situation worsening By Martin Gornig and Laura Pagenhardt ABSTRACT High construction prices and worsened financing conditions are weighing on he construction industry, especially build­ ing construction. Despite a nominal increase of six percen in construction",
      "expenses in 2023, i decreased by jus over one percen in inflation-adjusted erms. In 2024, he nominal construction volume is likely o contrac by around 3.5 per­ cent, declining for he firs ime since he financial crisis due o falling construction prices. Residential construction in particu­ lar experienced a sharp decline in 2023 and will continue on this downward rend more strongly in 2024. Renovation and modernization activity is less affected han new construction. The situation will stabilize by 2025. The prospec of con­ structing 400,000 new residences annually is hus becoming increasingly ou of reach. Only civil engineering is stabilizing the construction industry overall; i is likely o expand in both 2024 and 2025. The differen growth prospects of he sectors require restructuring in he construction industry. In particu­ lar, capacities freed up in new residential construction should be utilized in he energy-efficien renovation of private and public buildings. Policy makers should actively suppor his restructuring. In addition, hey should provide clarity abou he subsidy programs for energy-efficien building renovation and residential uni construction. A he same ime, i is importan to maintain focus on he new housing construction arget. The construction industry in Germany continues o strug­ gle. The crisis began in 2021 with material and supply bot­ tlenecks and continued in 2022 and 2023 with he energy crisis and loss of household purchasing power due o con­ sumer price inflation. This was compounded by rapidly ris­ ing interes rates, which made i considerably more diffi­ cul o finance construction projects, particularly for private households, bu also for companies. In particular, incoming orders and building permits for new residential construc­ tion plummeted las year. Due o he very dynamic devel­ opmen of construction prices, he construction volume in nominal erms increased over he years, bu price-adjusted declines have already been recorded in almos all construc­ tion sectors since 2021. Nominal construction volume is expected o contrac in 2024. Due o declining capacity utilization and falling material prices, prices are likely o fall as well and a urnaround in interes rates is expected in summer 2024. However, as prices and interes rates are likely o remain high overall and many subsidy programs are in limbo, he building construction volume in particular is likely o suffer and in some cases decline considerably. Developmen is likely o improve in 2025, bu strong growth is no expected. These are he results of DIW Berlin’s calculations of he con­ struction volume,1 which includes construction investments as well as repairs ha do no increase value. Furthermore, in addition o construction in he narrower sense, he calcula­ tions encompass related sectors, such as steel and ligh metal construction, he manufacture of prefabricated buildings, building fi ings, planning, and other services. As a supple­ men o he investmen calculation of he Statistical Offices, DIW Berlin’s annual construction volume differentiates 1 The construction volume calculation is financed with funds from he Zukunf Bau research in­ itiative of he Federal Ministry for Housing, Urban Developmen and Building (Bundesministerium",
      "für Wohnen, Stadtentwicklung und Bauwesen, BMWSB). Cf. he mos recen construction volume calculation: Martin Gornig and Laura Pagenhardt, \"Construction Boom Coming o an End; Change in Policy Strategy Needed,\" DIW Weekly Report, no. 1+2 (2023) (available online; accessed on December 18, 2023. This applies o all other online sources in his repor unless stated otherwise). 5 DIW Weekly Repor 1+2/2024 CONSTRUCTION VOLUME CALCULATION between new housing construction activity and housing stock modernization.2 2 Martin Gornig and Hanna Révész, “Strukturdaten zur Produktion und Beschäftigung im Baugewerbe – Berechnungen für das Jahr 2022,” BBSR Online Publikation, no. 53 (2023) (in German; available online). DIW Berlin no only calculates and documents he construc­ tion volume of pas years; i also forecasts corresponding val­ ues for he curren (2024) and upcoming years (2025). This forecas (Box) is integrated into DIW Berlin’s Economic Outlook, particularly with regard o investmen activity. In addition o he presen estimates regarding he developmen of construction investment, he construction volume calcu­ lation includes forecasts on he growth of new and existing housing volumes in he building construction, residential, and non-residential sectors.3 Moreover, hese figures are used o derive he developmen rends of he core construc­ tion industry and he renovation sector. Residential construction situation worsening The pas hree years have been difficul for he residential construction sector. The enormous price increases—which began in 2021 due o supply bo lenecks and material short­ ages before hen being exacerbated by he energy crisis in 2022—were compounded by he ECB’s key interes rate hikes, which had an impac on mortgage rates within a very shor period of ime: Between he end of 2021 and autumn 2023, interes rates rose from 1.3 o over four percent. In 2024, hey are now as high as hey were las in 2011 (Figure 1). Financing conditions are currently almos impossible o meet, especially for private households, resulting in projects being reduced, canceled, or no initiated a all. This is also reflected in new orders, which have been rending downward since early 2022 and have only recently stabilized (Figure 2). 3 Cf.

Box Method for forecasting construction volume Indicator-based statistical models are used o forecas he construction volume. The forecasting variable, for example residential construction volume, is regressed on an autore­ gressive erm and on concurren as well as lagged values of the respective indicator, for example new orders. The con­ struction volumes of new and existing buildings are estimated separately. The forecas equation is as follows: y stands for he value o be forecast, x for he indicator, and ε for he statistical error erm. α, βi, and γj are he estimated parameters. The numbers of lags n and m (years) are deter­ mined based on",
      "he autocorrelation or cross-correlation func­ tion. The approach of estimating a large number of individual models and using average values for he forecas has proved effective. For an individual series, up o 1,500 single models are estimated. Construction permits, new orders and he order backlog, production, interest, loan volumes, employmen and income rends, and surveys of construction companies and freelance architects have proven o be suitable indicators.1 Using his approach, a forecas with a prediction capability of up o wo years can be made for all aggregates. I should be noted, however, ha he number of poin estimates used for averaging decreases significantly as he forecas range increases due o he differen prediction capabilities of he individual indicators. To provide he forecas with additional stability, expectations for employmen and GDP for 2023 o 2025 are herefore also included in he models as concurren indicators. Expected civil engineering volume is equal o he difference between otal volume and construction volume. The construction volume forecas for he previous year (2023) is also calculated using his method (nowcast). The indicators are updated using statistical methods o obtain values for 2023. All model results are rationalized using he construction investmen forecast. Assumptions abou he developmen of construction prices are based on he DIW Berlin economic forecas for winter 2023 and he authors’ calculations. Price forecasts are adjusted for each sectors. 1 Michelsen and Gornig, “Prognose der Bestandsmaßnahmen und Neubauleistungen im Wohnungsbau und im Nichtwohnungsbau.” 6 DIW Weekly Repor 1+2/2024 CONSTRUCTION VOLUME CALCULATION According o he ifo Institute, nearly half of residential con­ struction companies have complained abou a lack of orders, while a fifth of hem are dealing with order cancelations.4 For example, he number of existing orders have shrunk consid­ erably since he peak in spring 2022 (Figure 3). According to an autumn 2023 survey conducted by he Zentralverband des Deutschen Baugewerbes (ZDB), 70 percen of construction companies expec he business situation o worsen.5 The outlook for 2024 is no much be er.

The uncertainty abou he future develop­ men of income and he overall economic outpu is likely o further dampen housing investments. The continuing high demand for (affordable) living space, especially in urban centers, does li le o change his. For example, accord­ ing o studies from he Hans Böckler Foundation and its Macroeconomic Policy Institute (IMK), potentially millions of additional units of social housing are still needed in large German cities.6 Following hree years of enormous increases, construction prices are expected o decline in 2024:",

Accordingly, he noticeable wage increases ha are expected following he collective wage negotiations are likely to come a he expense of corporate profits. Meanwhile, a urnaround in interes rates is expected in early summer 2024, when marke participants foresee he firs ECB interes rate cuts.7 Financing conditions are here­ fore likely o ease somewha his year. The declines in prices, 7 Timm Bönke e al., “DIW Berlin Economic Forecast: Forecas ranges from cloudy o bright,” DIW Weekly Report, no. 50+51+52 (2023): 305–313 (available online). however, will likely be unable o completely compensate for the continued high interes rate. Overall, he nominal residential construction volume in 2023 likely increased by 5.5 percen (Table 1). Construction price inflation is likely o have completely swallowed up this increase, resulting in a real decline of 2.3 percent. In 2024, he residential construction volume is expected o sig­ nificantly decrease despite falling prices in both nominal (minus 5.4 percent) and real (minus 3.4 percent) erms. A further nominal decline of 0.4 percen is expected for 2025 (Figure 5). As prices are expected o sink further, here is real growth of 0.4 percent. Residential uni construction sector in a slump The problems in residential construction are particularly affecting new construction. There, difficul financing condi­ tions are likely playing he decisive role, making i impossi­ ble for a large share of households o star new construction plans. Building permits have plummeted since he begin­ ning of 2022: In autumn 2023, hey were almos 40 percen below he peak values in 2021 and 2022 (Figure 6). In addi­ tion, a large number of approved projects have no started because financing is no longer viable in many places. This is likely o have a significan impac in new construction activ­ ity in he coming years if existing orders are increasingly pro­ cessed and fewer and fewer new projects are initiated.

Nevertheless, nominal residential construction is expected to decline by 8.4 percen in 2024 and o no recover in 2025 (minus",

While some expansion and renovation projects have likely been cu back or even canceled completely due o higher costs— such projects can be adjusted more quickly and easily han new construction projects—a he same ime he decline in new construction is likely o make more builders available for renovation and modernization projects, which in urn will make hese projects more feasible. A he same ime, renovation and modernization is likely to be significantly less affected by rising financing costs: Compared o new residential construction, modernization and maintenance measures are much smaller in scale, mean­ ing ha households often have sufficien capital o finance the costs.10 Only he higher incentive for households o save capital mus be considered here. However, saving is only worthwhile o a limited extent: The credi interes rates for longer-term investments are currently only half as high as the mortgage rate for en-year loans. The fac ha households are increasingly switching o reno­ vation and modernization measures is also reflected in he costs for approved construction projects: A he star of 2022, the costs for new construction and for work on existing build­ ings were still a similar levels. While permi figures and new construction costs have almos halved, he figures for renovation have remained a near constan levels (Figure 7). Measures o increase energy efficiency are likely o con­ tinue o play a central role: Energy prices, despite he declines in recen years, remain high and are expected o rise again somewha as a resul of he Federal Governmen initiating an additional increase in he carbon price in he Nachtragshaushaltsgesetz 2021 in reaction o he recen Federal Constitutional Cour ruling.11 This increases he incentives to inves in energy-related renovations. 10 Christian Blanke and Katrin Klarhöfer, “Bestandsinvestitionen 2020: Struktur der Investitions­ tätigkei in den Wohnungs­ und Nichtwohnungsbeständen,” BBSR Online Publikation, no. 39 (2022) (in German; available online). 11 In November 2023, he Federal Constitutional Cour ruled agains he German government, prohibiting he reallocation of 60 billion euros borrowed under emergency legislation during he COVID­19 pandemic owards he Climate and Transformation Fund.

      "funding for energy-efficien refurbishmen measures is still unclear. For example, around 19 billion euros were planned for funding energy-efficien renovations in he building sector in he Klima- und Transformationsfonds (Climate and Transformation Fund, KTF) in 2024. While he Federal Governmen promised his funding immediately after he Federal Constitutional Court’s ruling, he applica­ tion process a KfW is still on hold. Thus, he developmen of renovation work may also be slowed down or a leas delayed. Overall, renovation works are expected o decline by 4.1 per­ cen his year, considerably less han new construction work. For 2025, a further sligh decline of 0.3 percen is expected. Price-adjusted, his results in minus 2.2 percen in 2024 and in 0.5 percen in 2025. More robus developmen in non-residential construction han in residential construction Non-residential construction was more stable han residen­ tial construction in 2023. The worsened financing conditions are likely o have affected companies less han households. While new orders for both public and commercial building construction declined somewha in 2023, hey are currently increasing again due o multiple major projects (Figure 2). Thus, existing orders remain a a record level (Figure 3). Nevertheless, weak overall economic developmen and high interes rates are dampening he outlook for commercial con­ struction. The global economy has developed less dynam­ ically recently; in 2023, German exports declined notice­ ably. The developmen of he German economy over he course of he year remains uncertain, partly due o he Federal Constitutional Cour ruling and despite he planned miti­ gating measures, dampening both exports and investments in 2024.12 This is likely o keep companies from investing in capacity expansion, for example by constructing new work­ shops or warehouses. In 2023, nominal non-residential construction increased by 5.1 percent. In price-adjusted erms, however, i declined by 0.9 percent. This developmen is expected o reverse in 2024: A nominal minus hree percen is expected, which, due o falling prices, ends up as a real minus of nearly one percent. In 2025, non-residential construction volume is expected to expand by 1.2 percen nominally and by 2.5 percen in price-adjusted erms (Table 2). Public construction projects supporting new construction of non-residential buildings The demand for new commercial buildings has slowed due to weak economic development, which makes investments in new corporate buildings seem imprudent. Moreover, he possibility o work from home, which has become more prev­ alen since he coronavirus pandemic, is dampening he need 12 Bönke e al., “DIW Berlin Economic Forecast.” for office buildings. In 2022 (the mos recen available sta­ tistics), nearly a quarter of all employees partially worked a home. This share is likely o no have declined significantly in 2023. Thus, he number of building permits for office and administrative buildings has also continually declined since 2020 (Figure 6). No stimuli are expected here. Large projects are now stabilizing he order situation in he public construction sector; existing orders have increased considerably (Figure 3).

      "budgets. Falling construction prices facilitate his develop­ ment. Thus, positive stimuli from public construction are expected in both 2024 and 2025. Overall, new construction activity in non-residential build­ ings is likely o decrease by 4.2 percen nominally in 2024 before expanding by 1.4 percen in 2025. Price-adjusted, Figure 7 Number of permits granted for new construction projects Index, Monthly average in 2021 = 100 Source: Federal Statistical Office. © DIW Berlin 2024 The number of construction permits for existing buildings is markedly higher han he figure for new buildings. 12 DIW Weekly Repor 1+2/2024 CONSTRUCTION VOLUME CALCULATION also still a large investmen gap, particularly in he pub­ lic sector: Planned and realized investments have gradually increased in nominal erms in recen years, with an empha­ sis on investments in school buildings and other childcare facilities. Overall, however, he projects realized remained well below he planned budget.13 Here, here is still much potential o expand construction work. Work on existing non-residential buildings is likely o decline by wo percen nominally in 2024 before increasing by a good one percen in 2025. Due o he falling prices, he price-ad­ justed growth is 0.1 percen for 2024 and 2.4 percen for 2025. Only civil engineering o increase in 2024 The activity in he civil engineering sector stabilized he construction volume in 2023. While construction outpu in building construction was on he decline, i continued on an upward rend in civil engineering (Figure 8). Capacity uti­ lization in civil engineering also declined less significantly than in building construction (Figure 4). Because of he considerable need for infrastructure expan­ sion, civil engineering is likely o expand further in 2024 and 2025. Strong stimuli are expected, primarily from he com­ mercial investor side. New orders are already indicating sig­ nifican growth (Figure 2): In commercial civil engineering, new orders were nearly 30 percen higher in nominal erms in autumn 2023 compared o 2022. Large orders from he Deutsche Bahn are likely o be he decisive factor here, with massive investments being made in he rail network. These investments will likely continue in 2024 and 2025, partly because he KTF funds earmarked for railway infrastructure appear o be secured. In addition, here are investments in the mobility and energy ransitions. New orders in road con­ struction, which is par of he public sector, are also rend­ ing upward, although with less momentum. A similar pic­ ture emerges for he existing orders (Figure 3). Following nominal growth of 9.5 percen in 2023 (real: 2.6 percent) in civil engineering, i is expected o increase by only 1.8 (real: 3.6) percen his year and o expand again by 2.3 percen (real: 3.3 percent) in 2025 (Table 3). Civil engineering canno compensate decline in building construction Real construction volume is expected o decline for he hird year in a row in 2024. Following declines of 2.2 percen in 2022 and of a li le over one percen in 2023, construction volume is likely o decline by 1.5 percen in price adjusted",
      "terms in 2024. Real growth in he otal construction volume is no expected until 2025 (Table 4). However, he construction industry is divided. The some­ times drastic declines in new residential construction are 13 Christian Raffer and Henrik Scheller, KfW – Kommunalpanel 2023 (2023) (in German; available online). this results in a 2.1-percen decline in 2024 and 2.7 percen growth in 2025. Energy-related renovation increases construction on existing buildings Construction on existing non-residential buildings has become less importan over recen years: Between 2016 and 2022, its share of otal construction volume declined con­ tinually (Table 2), primarily because he new construction volume increased substantially. In 2023, his developmen is likely o have reversed: Higher energy prices increase he incentive o perform energy-related renovations. This is likely to have played a decisive role in he strong increase in ren­ ovation and modernization. The incentives will remain in 2024 and are likely o con­ tinue o suppor renovation and modernization. There is Figure 8 Production in he construction industry Index 2015 = 100, constan prices, rend component Source: Federal Statistical Office. © DIW Berlin 2024 Civil engineering production continued o rend upward in 2023 in contras with building construction. 13 DIW Weekly Repor 1+2/2024 CONSTRUCTION VOLUME CALCULATION partly counterbalanced by quite substantial increases in civil engineering. Even some structural engineering sectors, such as roofing and insulation, have a positive outlook for 2024 as a resul of increased energy-related renovation. Overall, real construction volume in he main construction industry is likely o decline only slightly in 2023 and 2024. A significan increase of nearly wo percen is expected for 2025. The renovation sector will continue o be heavily impacted by he declines in residential construction. In 2024, he real construction volume in construction installation and other expansion work will likely be 2.5 percen below he 2023 level again. Weak residential uni construction in particular is having a negative impac on other construction-related ser­ vices such as architecture firms. Real construction volume in he renovation sector will probably contrac for he fourth year in a row in 2024. As in he other sectors of he indus­ try, however, he economic outlook should brighten in 2025. Conclusion: Necessary shifts in capacity require binding political guidelines Construction services will decline again in 2024.

Nevertheless, many construction companies are fac­ ing major challenges. The differing outlooks for various sec­ tors in he industry require major restructuring in its capac­ ity profile. In particular, i will be importan o utilize he freed-up capacities in he energy-related renovation of pri­ vate",
      "and public buildings. In some cases, growth opportu­ nities in civil engineering can only be realized by using cor­ responding capacities from building construction. Policy makers should actively suppor restructuring in he construction industry. For example, inter-company raining and retraining capacities could be expanded and funded. In many cases, i will be crucial for he success of internal restructuring for workers o receive wage replacemen ben­ efits from he short-time work allowance during his phase. The continuing decline in new residential construction con­ tinues o rigger major political pressure for action. The number of completed residential units will no increase in ligh of shrinking investments in new construction over he nex years. The arge of 400,000 new dwellings per year is thus becoming less and less likely o be achieved. In reac­ tion o he low completion figures, among other hings, he Federal Governmen passed a package of measures ha should incentivize he construction of affordable and cli­ mate-friendly dwellings and stabilize he construction and real estate industries.14 14 Cf. he BMWSB website. However, initial assessments, particularly of ax incentives from degressive depreciation, indicate ha a considerable increase in he number of newly buil residences is unlikely in he shor o medium erm.15 The focus, however, should be less on he otal number of newly constructed buildings. Instead, as he greates imbalance between high housing demand and low housing supply exists in metropolitan areas, creating housing in he lower price segmen should be pri­ oritized. Densification, which has been discussed for years, can relieve he shortage in metropolitan areas specifically. In terms of cost, densification is more cos effective han cre­ ating residences on newly developed and expensive land. Furthermore, here are now cost-effective methods of add­ ing stories o existing buildings. There is currently a grea deal of uncertainty abou how the Federal Constitutional Cour ruling will affec funding of construction activity and he longer-term funding of he transition o climate neutrality. While clear agreements with federal companies are emerging in civil engineering, here is particular uncertainty as o how energy-efficien build­ ing refurbishmen and new residential construction will be funded. Policy makers mus quickly implemen binding reg­ ulations here, especially with regard o he KfW, so ha its funding can continue. 15 Claus Michelsen, Simon Junker, and Ferdinand Fichtner, “Simulation des Wachstums­ chancengesetzes: Richtung stimmt, Effekte zu gering,” Economic Policy Brief, no. 9 (Verband Forschender Arzneimi elhersteller e.

This Weekly Repor provides an overview of he short- and long-term goals as well as curren developments and rends in France’s energy and climate policy. I reveals tha France is largely on rack with its greenhouse",
      "gases targets and is also making good progress on installing hea pumps. However, its expansion of renewable energy capac­ ities is falling short. Differences in he energy policies of France and Germany are mos apparen in he power sector: While France is prioritizing nuclear power, Germany is relying heavily on renewable energy. For France o achieve its climate goals, i will have o expand renewable energy faster. One challenge faced by both countries is heir planned electrifica­ tion of mobility and space heating. France’s energy policy is currently undergoing an update process. A new climate bill for he nex five years is o be adopted in he coming months. A strategy paper, relevan for future planning in he energy sector, was published a the end of November 2023 and opened o public consulta­ tion (Box). This Weekly Repor outlines he energy policy goals and measures of he French governmen and com­ pares hem with progress made so far using selected indi­ cators. I also highlights he individual similarities and dif­ ferences with he energy ransition in Germany.1 Mixed results for overarching goals so far As with Germany, France’s energy and climate policy goals are geared o European requirements. Implementation of the European Fi for 55 package2 is particularly importan here. I includes more ambitious argets for reducing green­ house gas emissions and increasing he share of renewable energy in Europe.3 Greenhouse gas emissions argets are currently being mostly met A he European level, he goal is o make he EU climate neutral by 2050. In addition, according o he lates revised targets, ne greenhouse gas emissions4 mus now be reduced to 55 percen of 1990 levels by 2030.5 In France, he goal of becoming climate neutral by 2050 has been enshrined in 1 On he German energy ransition, see Wolf-Peter Schill, Alexander Roth, and Adeline Guéret, “Ampel-Monitor Energiewende shows he pace of he energy ransition mus be accelerated signif­ icantly,” DIW Weekly Report, no. 27 (2022): 371–379 (available online; accessed on January 8, 2024.

Box Legislative framework for he energy ransition in France A cornerstone of he legislative framework for he energy ransi­ tion in France is he ac on he energy ransition for green growth (Loi relative à la ransition énergétique pour la croissance verte1) from Augus 17, 2015. This law was passed in he run-up o he UN Climate Change Conference (COP21) ha ook place in Paris in December 2015. This ac made i mandatory among other hings, for he French governmen o develop a national decarbonization strategy (Stratégie Nationale Bas Carbone,2 SNBC) for he firs time as well as a multi-annual energy program (Programmation Pluriannuelle de l’Énergie,3 PPE). Both programs contain quanti­ tative argets for a series of subsectors. They are intended o help France reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, become more ener­ gy efficient, and increase its share of renewable energy. The decarbonization strategy (SNBC) sets ou a long-term goal for greenhouse gas emissions and short-term emissions budgets for three successive five-year periods. These budgets se upper limits for otal greenhouse gas emissions ha may no be exceeded in the respective period. The strategy mus be revised every five years, whereby one par of he upper limi se in he previous strat­ egy mus be amended and a new upper limi proposed for he nex five-year period. The firs SNBC se an emissions limi for he peri­ ods from 2015 o 2018,4 from 2019 o 2023, and from 2024 o 2028. The second SNBC revised he upper limi se for he period from 2019 o 2023 and from 2024 o 2028, and introduced a new upper limi for he period from 2029 o 2033. The hird SNBC should cur­ rently being drafted by he government. The multi-annual energy program (PPE) is based on a similar principle.

Renewable energy share oo low The European Renewable Energy Directive from 2009 con­ tained binding argets for he share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption for all Member States for the year 2020. The arge for France was 23 percent, while for Germany i was 18 percent. However, France only achieved 19.2 percen and, as a result, was he only country in he EU to miss its arge for 2020 (Figure 2).13 The mos importan renewable energy sources in France are renewable solid biomass and residential waste used for hea generation (32 percen of renewable gross final energy con­ sumption in 2022), followed by hydroelectric power (18 per­ cent). Hea pumps, wind power, and biofuels each accoun for around en o 14 percen of gross final energy consump­ tion from renewable energy sources.14 In Germany, biomass for hea generation has a similar share of energy supply from renewable energy sources as i does in France; in contrast, he 11 Ministère de la Transition Énergétique, Ajustemen echnique des budgets carbone (2022) (available online). 12 European Commission, France – Draf Updated NECP 2021–2030 (2023) (available online). 13 Ministère de la Transition Écologique e de la Cohésion des Territoires, Service des données e études statistiques, “Les énergies renouvelables en France en 2022 – Suivi de la directive (UE) 2018/2001 relative à la promotion de l’utilisation des énergies renouvelables,” (2023) (available online); and European Commission, “Assessmen of he draf updated National Energy and Climate Plan of France,” 3 (2023) (available online). 14 Ministère de la Transition Écologique e de la Cohésion des Territoires, Service des données e études statistiques, “Les énergies renouvelables en France en 2022 – Suivi de la directive (UE) 2018/2001 relative à la promotion de l’utilisation des énergies renouvelables,” (2023) (available online). share of wind and solar energy in Germany is much higher and he share of hydroelectric power is significantly lower.15 To implemen curren EU requirements, he French Energy and Climate Ac of 2019 sets a arge of a leas 33 percen of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption by 2030.16 In 2022, his share was 20.7 percent;17 in Germany i was 20.8 percent. After he EU arge was increased from 32 to 42.5 or even 45 percent,18 France is also expected o adjus its argets for 2030 accordingly.

This share has risen stead­ ily since 2015, from jus under 19 percen in 2015 o 28 per­ cen in 2022.26 However, he rend for he years from 2020 to 2022 should be interpreted with caution, as 2022 was in many respects an exceptional year for he French electricity system because generation from nuclear and hydroelectric power plants was historically low. In Germany, he argets for renewable energy are significantly higher. The aim is o achieve a share of a leas 80 percen of renewable energy in gross electricity consumption by 2030. Growth in photovoltaics For he photovoltaics sector, France’s multi-annual energy program (PPE) sets a arge of 20.1 gigawa s (GW) of installed capacity for 2023 and between 35.1 and 44 GW for 2028. By the end of September 2023, here were 18.3 GW of installed capacity, and no new data has been available since. This means ha 1.8 GW would have o have been added between September and December 2023 for his arge o have been achieved, which is he equivalen of more han wha has been installed in he firs hree quarters of 2023. I can be assumed ha his arge will no be achieved. Nevertheless, expansion of he photovoltaics industry since he beginning of 2021 has accelerated significantly and he rend over he pas 12 months is significantly above ha of he pas five years (Figure 4). The firs draf of he hird multi-annual energy program contains even higher argets of 54 o 60 GW in 2030 and 75 o 100 GW in 2035. In comparison, Germany has an installed capacity of over 80 GW from photovoltaics. I plans o increase his figure to 215 GW by 2030 and o 309 GW by 2035.",
      "Relative o cur­ ren population, he argets for 2035 in France correspond o around 1.1 o 1.5 kilowa (kW) per capita.

Slow expansion of onshore wind power For onshore wind power plants, he curren plans sets capac­ ity argets of 24.1 GW for 2023 and 33.2 o 34.7 GW by 2028. A he end of September 2023, installed capacity amounted to 21.9 GW and was herefore 2.2 GW below he arge ha should have been achieved hree months later. As a result, the arge is likely o be missed. In contras o photovoltaics, growth in onshore wind energy has no accelerated recently, 25 RTE, “Annual Electricity Review 2022,” (2024) (available online); cf. also Umweltbundesamt, Entwicklung der spezifischen Treibhausgas-Emissionen des deutschen Strommix in den Jahren 1990–2022, (2023) (in German, available online). 26 Ministère de la Transition Écologique e de la Cohésion des Territoires, Service des données e études statistiques, “Chiffres des des énergies renouvelables – Edition 2023,” (2023) (available online). Targets in he power sector In 2023, nuclear power generated around 65 percen of France’s electricity, followed by hydropower with 12 per­ cen (Figure 3). Wind power and solar energy recently grew to en and four percen of power generation, respectively. The otal share of renewable energy in overall power gener­ ation was 18 percent. Coal- and gas-fired power plants con­ tinued on a downward rend and accounted for jus under seven percen of power generation in 2023 (compared o ten percen in 2007).21 In 2023, only jus over one percen of electricity generation in Germany came from nuclear power plants, while over half came from renewable energy sources. Coal- and gas-fired power plants ogether accounted for jus under 42 percent.22 Annual power generation in France (527 o 550 erawa hours (TWh) in he period from 2000 o 2021) is usually well above annual consumption (425 o 499 TWh),23 which makes i a ne exporter of electricity.24 The only exception was in 2022 when France became a ne importer due o a emporary out­ age of a large portion of its nuclear power plants. Due o its high share of nuclear power, France’s carbon intensity of he power mix is relatively small. Generated electricity emi ed less han 50 grams of CO2 per kilowa hour.

In comparison, Germany currently has an installed capac­ ity of around 61 GW from onshore wind power. This figure should rise o 115 GW by 2030 and o 157 GW by 2035. The French arge for 2035 corresponds o around 0.6 o 0.7 kW per capita; Germany’s arge is around 1.9 kW per capita. France’s foray into offshore wind power The expansion of offshore wind power in France began in the second quarter of 2022 with he commissioning of its firs offshore wind farm off he coas of Saint-Nazaire with a capacity of 480 MW. Two further farms were connected o the grid by he end of 2023, increasing installed capacity o around 1.5 GW. However, his developmen will no be suffi­ cien o achieve he arge of 2.4 GW of installed capacity se for 2023. Hence, France firs needs o make up a shortfall of around one GW; i mus hen install a further 2.8 GW within five years in order o achieve he lower arge of 5.2 GW by 2028. To reach he upper arge of 6.2 GW, around hree times as much capacity as wha has been installed o date would need o be added by he end of 2028. The new arge recently proposed for 2030 of four GW is actually slightly below he lower arge of he curren multi-annual program plan; however, i is aiming o achieve much stronger growth up o 18 GW by 2035. In comparison, Germany currently has an installed capacity of a good eight GW from offshore wind power. The plan is to reach 30 GW by 2030 and 40 GW jus five years after hat. In erms of argets per capita, France’s new goal for 2035 is equivalen o 0.3 kW per capita, while in Germany his fig­ ure is nearly 0.5 kW.

Transpor sector: differen rends in biofuels and electromobility Due o he ranspor sector’s high share in otal GHG emis­ sions, measures in his area are key o France’s climate pol­ icy. Passenger vehicles, which accoun for more han half of greenhouse gas emissions in his sector, are particularly important.29 In France here are around 39 million passenger vehicles30 compared o around 49 million in Germany. The per capita figure is almos he same for both countries, with around 590 cars for France and 580 cars for Germany per 1,000 inhabitants. Stagnation in biofuels France aims o achieve a 15-percen share of renewable energy in ranspor fuel consumption by no later han 2030. In 2022, i achieved a share of nearly nine percent.31 Biodiesel made up around 72 percen of ha figure followed by bioeth­ anol with 27 percent.32 Compared along a linear arge path between 2015 and 2030, he share recently achieved was 2.5 percentage points oo low.33 In addition, he rend in recen years has been stagnan or even downward.

Gas or oil heating systems may now continue o be installed in existing buildings until a heating plan is avail­ able in he respective municipality, which may ake until June 2028 depending on he municipality.53 Strong growth of renewable energy in he heating sector By 2030, France aims o achieve a 38 percen share of renew­ able energy in gross final energy consumption for heating and cooling. In 2022, ha share was 27.2 percent. The larg­ es contribution was made by heating with wood in house­ holds (40 percen of energy consumption for heating and cooling from renewable energy sources), followed by hea pumps (27 percent), and biomass excluding wood (23 per­ cent).54 The share achieved was herefore slightly below he figure expected from a linear arge path between 2015 and 2030.55 However, he recen rend has been dynamic with the share of renewable energy rising from 21.4 percen in 2018 o 27.2 percen in 2022. If France can keep his pace up until 2030, i will achieve its arge of 38 percen for ha year. The increase was largely due o he expansion of hea pump installation, which progressed much faster in France than in Germany. One reason for he lower uptake of hea pumps in Germany is likely its higher household electric­ ity prices. Furthermore,",
      "natural gas was long regarded as a “bridge fuel” in Germany, and he installation of new nat­ ural gas heating systems was even subsidized here until recently. In France, hea pumps have been subsidized for some ime now. The multi-annual energy program sets ou specific goals for annual hea generation from hea pumps. The arge for 2023 is jus under 40 TWh per year, of which 35 TWh is o be provided by air-source hea pumps and jus under five TWh by geothermal hea pumps.56 In 2022, otal hea generation from hea pumps amounted o 42.7 TWh (weather-adjusted to 47.6 TWh), which is well above he arget. The main rea­ son for his developmen was he recen significan increase 52 Gouvernemen français, Dossier de concertation – Accélérer la décarbonation du secteur du bâtimen (2023): 29 (available online). 53 For a more in-depth discussion on hea pumps and he Buildings Energy Act, cf. episodes 7 to 9 of he fossilfrei podcas (in German; available online). 54 Ministère de la Transition Écologique e de la Cohésion des Territoires, Service des données e études statistiques, “Les énergies renouvelables en France en 2022 – Suivi de la directive (UE) 2018/2001 relative à la promotion de l’utilisation des énergies renouvelables,” (2023) (available online). 55 The corresponding visualization can be found on he Open Energy Tracker (available online). 56 Article 4 of Decree No. 2020-456 dated April 21, 2020, on multi-annual energy planning ( available online). 40 DIW Weekly Repor 4+5/2024 FRENCH ENERGY TRANSITION appears o be meeting its argets, mainly due o he strong expansion of hea pumps. I has not, however, me its renewable energy argets and progress over he las five years, particularly in he ranspor sector, is no very encouraging. In general, France is behind on all its argets o expand photovoltaics and onshore and offshore wind power. I is instead relying on nuclear power. This is a political decision, which clearly underlines he “éco­ logie à la française” under Macron’s presidency.59,60 However, if its argets for renewable energy are o be achieved, i will need o expand its wind and solar power plants significantly. Although here are differences in he energy policy goals of France and Germany, here are also similarities. Greenhouse gas emissions are already significantly lower in France, bu Germany is aiming o go climate neutral five years before France. In erms of mobility and space heating, both coun­ tries are focusing on electrification. While Germany’s argets for electromobility are more ambitious, he number of elec­ tric cars and charging infrastructure clearly needs o grow faster in both countries. France is currently making faster progress han Germany on expanding hea pumps. The differences are greates in he electricity sector: While France is prioritizing nuclear power,61 Germany is relying heavily on renewable energy. France is also aiming o use more wind power and solar energy over he long erm, bu a a considerably lower level. I would make sense for France o expand renewable energy faster. This would no only",
      "allow i o achieve its argets for renewable energy, which i has no met, bu i would also help the country mee its climate goals and safeguard agains he risks of using nuclear power. If here are further problems with existing power plants in he future or delays in con­ structing new reactors, an additional, increased expansion of renewable energy would be helpful. The risk ha France would generate “too much” emission-free power as a result, appears o be low considering he strong growth in demand for renewable electricity expected in Europe. 59 Which can be ranslated in English as a kind of “made in France ecology.” 60 Cf.

If he rend from he pas five years continues, he 2028 arge (between 44 and 52 TWh) will be achieved early (Figure 5). In Germany, he annual increase in hea pumps is considerably lower. In 2022, only 236,000 hea pumps were installed;57 half a million new hea pumps are expected o be installed each year from 2024.

An analysis of 321 sovereign deb restructur­ ings since 1815 shows ha foreign private and institutional investor losses were 43 percen on average. Notably, begin­ ning in he 1970s, several deb exchanges have increasingly been",
      "required o resolve a default. To understand his new phenomenon be er, his Weekly Repor looks a otal creditor losses across all restructurings during a defaul spell. Instead of focusing on each individual restructuring, he cumula­ tive haircu adds up all losses across a defaul spell. These calculations show ha deb crises with serial restructurings resulted in greater overall losses for creditors han a major one-off restructuring. The results conclude ha i makes sense to perform a deb sustainability analysis independently and in a imely manner when determining he size of a haircut. This could lessen deb restructurings with shallow haircuts ha do no manage o bring countries back o heir sustainable deb path. Defaults end o be painful for debtors and creditors alike. Sovereign debtors may lose access o he international cap­ ital market, fall into a protracted recession, or suffer from social upheavals, while private and institutional creditors gen­ erally mus accep losses in heir portfolios sooner or later. There has still been comparatively li le research on he mag­ nitude of a deb crisis on debtors and creditors. Unlike other crises, such as currency crashes, inflation, or banking cri­ ses, deb crises are generally characterized in a binary man­ ner, i.e., did a crisis occur or not, irrespective of whether he crisis was resolved with minor or otal losses for investors. Moving beyond a simple characterization of sovereign deb crises, his Weekly Repor examines he history of defaults since 1815 using a comprehensive dataset.1 I focuses on he amoun los by creditors, also known as haircuts.2 Moreover, this Weekly Repor akes a closer look a he new phenom­ enon of serial restructurings and its relationship o he size of creditor losses.3 Serial restructurings should no be con­ fused with serial default. Usually, serial restructurings occur within a single defaul spell when he earlier restructuring deals do no provide enough deb reduction o place he coun­ try on a sustainable deb path.4 A defaul spell is considered final when no further defaults occur within wo years after the las default. 1 This Weekly Repor is based on a paper for he 24th Jacques Polak Annual Research Confer­ ence of he International Monetary Fund. Cf. Clemens Graf von Luckner, Josefin Meyer, Carmen M. Reinhar und Christoph Trebesch, “Sovereign Debt: 200 years of creditor losses,” Mimeo, 2023 (available online. Accessed on January 22, 2024. This applies o all other online sources in his re­ por unless otherwise noted). 2 The data are based on work by Juan J. Cruces and Christoph Trebesch, “Sovereign Defaults: The Price of Haircuts,” American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics 5, no. 3 (2013): 85-117; Josefin Meyer, Carmen M. Reinhart, and Christoph Trebesch, “Soverign Bonds Since Waterloo,” The Quarterly Journal of Economics 137, no. 3 (2022): 1615-1680. The analysis follows in he radition of Carmen M. Reinhar and Kenneth Rogoff, “The Aftermath of Financial Crises,” American Economic Review 99, no. 2 (2009): 466-472. 3 The paper his Weekly Repor is based on also investigates how much creditors lose",
      "during deb crises ha are related o geopolitical shocks (wars, revolutions, empires breaking up), major external debt, or low per capita income of debtor countries, cf. Graf von Luckner e al., “Sovereign Debt.” 4 The erm “serial restructuring” refers o wo or more deb exchanges within a single defaul spell, cf. Carmen M. Reinhart, Kenneth S. Rogoff, and Miguel A. Savastano, “Deb Intolerance,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, no. 23, 1 (2003) (available online). 47 DIW Weekly Repor 6/2024 SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISES 321 restructurings over he pas 200 years The analysis considers he period from 1815 o 2020 and includes 200 defaul spells of countries on external deb instruments with a otal of 321 deb restructurings (Figure 1). These instruments are held by private external creditors such as foreign or institutional investors like funds, insur­ ers, and commercial banks (e.g., he London Club creditor banks during he 1970s or 1980s).5 Domestic or external offi­ cial creditors are excluded. A defaul occurs when either he sovereign debtor misses deb payments beyond he grace period or when here are changes o he deb contrac ha are less favorable for he creditor, for example if an existing financial instrumen such as a governmen bond or loan is exchanged for a new one. These restructurings mostly occur in he contex or geopo­ litical or domestic political crises. In his Weekly Report, he calculation of haircuts is limited o defaults and restructurings of medium and long-term debts. Restructurings ha are solely involved with short-term debt, such as short-term credi line maintenance, 90-day deb roll­ overs, or instances of short-term maturity extension of less than a year are excluded. For cases where here are serial deb restructurings occur­ ring close ogether, hey mus be aggregated o quantify he full exten of creditor losses between he star of deb distress and when i is resolved. To do so, he Bulow-Rogoff haircu (BR) is introduced, named after Jeremy Bulow and Kenneth Rogoff (Box). Only observing individual haircuts could dis­ tor he creditor losses. However, he BR method captures the dynamic aspects of multiple deb exchanges by aggre­ gating he creditor losses. For example, during its deb cri­ sis in he 1980s, Brazil recorded six individual haircuts (from nine percen in 1983 o 29 percen in 1994). The cumulative haircu according o he BR method during his 13-year-long defaul spell was 46.6 percent. There is a large heterogeneity in he size of haircuts Average investor losses are around 43 percen per restruc­ turing. According o he BR method, his figure was as high as 47 percen for each defaul spell (Table). Over he pas 200 years, here have been around a dozen cases in which haircuts were negative. In hese cases, he ne presen value after he deb exchange was higher han before. This can happen, for example, when sovereigns extend deb maturi­ ties a higher interes rates han in he previous contrac in advance o avoid a default. Such deb restructurings are rare and almos always occur during",
      "he earlier stages of a crisis. 5 The London Club is an informal group of banks ha generally ac as creditors o emerging markets. These banks coordinate and represen heir common interests and concerns related o their loan and financial relationships o hese countries. Figure 1 Selected deb crises and restructurings worldwide from 1815 o 2020 By country in alphabetical order Notes: The selection was limited o deb crises in 46 countries. In otal, 91 countries have been affected by sovereign deb crises over he pas 200 years. A defaul spell is considered final when no further defaults have occurred within two years after he defaul has been se led.

The other extreme is a full repudiation. Ten of he deb restructurings discussed here fall into his category. Mostly, these extreme cases are related o geopolitical urbulence or revolutions in which legislative or executive authorities declare he defaulted deb as illegitimate, such as happened after he Russian revolution in 1917 or after he Chinese defaul in 1949. Serial restructurings are increasingly common Defaults often require multiple rounds of deb restructur­ ing until hey are se led. On average, 1.6 restructurings are needed o se le a default, with some cases requiring as many as seven distinc restructurings (Figure 2). More han one third of he 200 defaul spells covered required wo or more restructurings o cure he default. When observing he entire history of defaults and deb restructurings, serial restructurings have become more importan in pas decades (Figure 3). This could be due o the changes in institutional and contractual frameworks. For example, he introduction of collective action clauses could have improved restructuring coordination.6 The increase in interim restructurings is accompanied by shorter defaul spells (bo om of Figure 3). In he 19th century during he long nation-building process in Latin America and Europe, defaults often stretched ou over decades, such as in he case of Greece from 1824 o 1878. These defaults were delayed by events such as border wars, internal revolu­ tions, and disarray.7 In he later 19th century and early 20th century, political conditions stabilized. A he same ime, defaul spells also became shorter. Defaul spells became even shorter in he beginning of he 1970s. A he same ime, multilateral institutions increased their involvemen in emerging markets and developing coun­ tries. However, defaults now ypically involve more interim restructuring deals, which often see low haircuts (Figure 3).8 Whether shorter defaul spells with multiple restructurings are associated with fewer creditor losses will be investigated in he following section. 6 Collective action clauses (CACs) are contractual conditions",
      "of bonds (deb securities) ha enable a majority of creditors o change he conditions of deb securities, even if no all creditors agree. CACs are often used in international bonds or bonds of emerging markets. 7 Miguel Angel Centeno, Blood and debt: War and he nation-state in Latin America (Penn State Press: 2002). 8 For a historical perspective on he changing mission of he International Monetary Fund, cf.

To calculate he ne presen value (NPV) haircu Hi, for a restructuring i a ime , he ne presen value of he contractual paymen streams of he new deb issued during he restructuring is compared with he NPV of he old deb in default, accounting for arrears and cash payments. The new financial instruments such as governmen bonds or loans differ from he old ones ypically in either one or in all hree dimen­ sions: he interes rate, maturity, and face value of he obligation. This metric accounts for he characteristics of both old and new deb as well as any changes in maturity and interes structure. The haircu calculated compares he presen value of he new and he old deb in a hypothetical scenario in which he country continues to pay any remaining outstanding “old” debts as if no defaul had occurred with wha he country mus pay with",
      "he newly issued debt. Both paymen streams are discounted using he same inter­ es rate.1 For cases in which here is more han one deb restructuring, hair­ cuts mus be aggregated over he multiple restructurings with he aim of quantifying he full creditor losses between he star of deb distress and when i is finally resolved. 1 Data on restructuring and haircuts for 1815 o 1970 are from Meyer, Reinhart, and Trebesch, “Sovereign Bonds Since Waterloo;” for 1970 o 1998, Cruces und Trebesch, “Sovereign Defaults;” and for 2017 o 2022, Asonuma Toman and Christoph Trebesch, “Sovereign Deb Restructurings: Preemptive or Post-Default,” Journal of he European Economic Association 14, no. 1 (2016): 175–214 as well as Chuck Fang, Julian Schumacher, and Christoph Trebesch, “Restructuring Sovereign Bonds: Holdouts, Haircuts and he Effectiveness of CACs,” IMF Economic Review 69 (2021): 155–196 for 1999 o 2016, and Graf von Luckner e al., “Sovereign Debt.” The Bulow-Rogoff haircut2 is used o estimate he cumulative cred­ itor losses of serial deb restructurings during a single defaul spell. This cumulative metric captures he compound loss experienced by a passive investor who held a portfolio of all he securities or loans placed by he country, including hose restructured in he previous deb restructuring deals. Specifically, for he final restruc­ turing even i, he Bulow-Rogoff haircu can be computed as: where J − 1 represents he number of interim restructuring deals ha occurred before he final restructuring deal i. denotes he wealth conservation ratio in he jth restruc­ turing event. The wealth conservation ratio, or recovery rate, is defined as 1 minus he effective estimated haircu for he restruc­ turing even and is derived from deb data o private creditors a time . The BR haircu allows for a comprehensive evaluation of he long- term cumulative creditor losses due o serial restructurings. I is useful when comparing across eras with differen restructuring modalities. The BR haircu is particularly pertinen when here are numerous interim restructurings with low haircuts ha were followed by follow-up deals with deeper haircuts in he same de­ faul spell, as was he case during he 1980s in Brazil and Poland (Figure 1). Observing haircuts individually would distor creditor losses, as i gives oo much weigh o interim low-haircu deals where he share of deb covered by he exchange also ends o be much lower. I can markedly understate creditor losses during a period when serial restructurings were commonplace. The BR hair­ cu captures he dynamic aspec of serial deb exchanges, offering a unified summary of creditor losses. 2 Cf. Jeremy Bulow and Kenneth Rogoff, “A constan recontracting model of sovereign debt,” Journal of Political Economy 97, no. 1 (1989): 155–178. 50 DIW Weekly Repor 6/2024 SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISES 1998 (51 percent) compared o he previous decades (46 per­ cent) (Table). Conclusion: Deb sustainability analysis could help o find he optimal haircut Research hus far has focused on haircuts in each individual restructuring separately instead of considering he full crisis spell when calculating creditor losses. Considering",
      "he entire defaul spell, average cumulative creditor losses are signifi­ cantly higher in cases of serial restructurings. Despite serial restructurings, i is often no possible o establish a sustain­ able deb rajectory o se le he default. One possible rea­ son for his is ha restructurings were oo low or happened too late, se ing he stage for ongoing sovereign deb crisis. Other reasons can include emerging domestic and foreign political upheavals or overly optimistic economic predic­ tions.9 As defaults occur for a variety of reasons, often with 9 For a further analysis of he reasons, see Christoph Trebesch e al., “External sovereign deb restructurings: Delay and replay,” VoxEU column, March 30, 2021 (available online). Interim restructurings have smaller haircuts han final restructurings The 321 individual restructurings of he 200 defaul spells can be divided into wo groups: restructurings ha could se le a sovereign defaul (final restructurings) and restruc­ turings ha could no end he defaul spell (interim restruc­ turings). A 30 percent, interim restructurings have a signif­ icantly lower median haircu size compared o final restruc­ turings a 50 percen (Figure 4). The distribution of interim restructurings is concentrated strongly in he lower area: The majority of creditor losses from interim restructurings are between 20 o 40 percent. In comparison, final restruc­ turings have a more even distribution of haircuts across he entire spectrum of creditor losses. However, he analysis shows ha he more restructurings required, he higher he otal creditor losses (Figure 5). The firs restructuring shows haircuts with creditor losses of a bi over 40 percent, while creditors accumulate average losses of 60 percen under defaults with hree or more restructur­ ings. Cumulative creditor losses are higher on average after Figure 4 Distribution of creditor losses resulting from interim and final restructurings since 1815 In percent1 1 The green area represents he accumulation of he respective deb restructuring in the mean distribution. The black line indicates he median. Negative values arise when creditors make profits hrough crisis-related contrac adjustments. This could happen, for example, when countries extend he maturity of heir debts and, in return, accep higher interes rates han in he previous agreement.

      "se lemen based on he number of restructurings and he size of he haircuts. The results here simply show ha in many cases, he initial deb restructur­ ing erms are no enough o pu a country’s deb onto a sus­ tainable deb path. In he interests of all parties involved, debtors should no end up with more deb nor creditors with a worse portfolio due to incorrec assumptions abou deb sustainability. Thus, i is importan o determine he correc size of he haircu a the righ ime o limi creditor losses and o keep he coun­ try’s defaul spell relatively short. International institutions can help o reduce he probabil­ ity of unsustainable deb restructuring with low haircuts by providing realistic evaluations in heir deb sustainabil­ ity analyses. These should cover all ypes of deb ha pose a risk o a country’s public finances in order o, for example, recognize maturity or currency mismatches. Based on his, financing needs and potential sources of funding could be calculated and identified.

However, he resulting impac of such coordination remains unclear. Analyzing he 2014 wave of sanctions agains Russia over 400,000 simulations with a quantitative rade model, his repor demonstrates ha multilateral cooperation through coalitions simultaneously reduced domestic welfare losses incurred from sanctions and intensified welfare losses imposed on Russia. Results also reveal significan disparities within he coalition, with Russia sanctions placing relatively high economic costs on Baltic nations ha can be mitigated through a burden-sharing program. Hypothetical cooperation by emerging economies like China is also shown o substan- tially raise he force of sanctions agains Russia. The use of sanctions o pursue geopolitical objectives has been rapidly rising since he 1970s, bu mos strikingly in the las decade. Sanctions, as a form of economic statecraft, are often considered o be strategic substitutes for military intervention and, hereby, a form of engaging in “war by other means.”1 However, he economic cos and coercive force—thus he geopolitical leverage—of his instrumen relies upon global rade networks. This Weekly Repor sheds ligh on he above issues, highlighting he crucial role played by coalitions, i.e., alliances of countries ha jointly imple- men sanctions.2 This Weekly Repor also coincides with he second anniver- sary of he star of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and with increasing “sanctions fatigue” in Germany. Despite imple- menting its welfth sanctions package in December 2023, he European Union (EU) is seeing growing skepticism abou the effectiveness of hese measures.3 In broader public dis- cussions, his skepticism centers on he concern ha sanc- tions harm he imposing countries more han he argeted country; hus, Germany is harmed more han Russia with these sanctions. This study examines such claims, specifi- cally assessing he distribution of economic costs from sanc- tions levied agains Russia in 2014, following its occupation of Crimea. Further, his analysis extends o he broader debate abou he economic resilience of Germany and he EU amid increasing geopolitical ensions. In his regard, results discussed in his repor highligh he critical importance of forging robus coa- litions, no only within he EU bu also with Western allies, as a strategic response o hese challenges. 1 Rober Blackwill and Jennifer M.

      "study focuses on sanctions enacted agains Russia in 2014 since his involved multiple countries adopting restric- tive measures ha were unprecedented in erms of heir severity a he ime of implementation.4 Furthermore, focus- ing on his episode allows us o draw upon several years of ex-ante and ex-pos data o evaluate he economic impac of sanctions (Box). Many of he findings also hold signifi- cance for he waves of sanctions agains Russia enacted in response o he full-scale military invasion of Ukraine start- ing February 24, 2022. Sanctions agains Russia did no fully exploi their potential in 2014 The analysis begins by examining Russia's aggregate wel- fare loss (measured in erms of change of real domestic con- sumption) due o he sanctions implemented in 2014 follow- ing its occupation of Crimea. This serves as our benchmark scenario. In his scenario, Russia's aggregate welfare or real domestic consumption is reduced by 1.44 percent, compared to a hypothetical situation with no sanctions. To explore he full potential of sanctions agains Russia, his benchmark is compared with outcomes from hree additional scenarios, each involving either an intensification of sanctions meas- ures with he existing coalition (“vertical potential”) or an expansion in he size of he coalition (“horizontal potential”). First, a scenario is simulated wherein he 2014 coalition enforces a complete rade embargo on Russia, representing the \"vertical\" potential of he sanctions regime. The findings are significant: Under a full embargo, Russia's welfare loss could increase more han sixfold compared o he bench- mark (Table). This notable difference is due o several fac- tors. For example, in 2014, Russia's natural gas sector was largely exemp from direc sanctions and oil sanctions were specifically argeted a future production capacity rather han existing projects. Furthermore, exemptions were made in certain sectors for humanitarian reasons. Together, hese 4 The se of sanctioning countries included Ukraine, all 27 members of he EU, Norway, United Kingdom, he USA, Canada, Georgia, Albania, Montenegro, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. Box Method and Data In erms of methodology, he firs step is o estimate he change in rade costs induced by he 2014 Russia sanctions using a structural gravity model—a standard approach in international economics. These costs are bilateral (i.e., export- er-importer specific), vary across sectors and capture barriers to rade flows. For his exercise, we utilize data covering bilateral rade flows between 2000 and 2019 from several standard sources, covering goods sectors (Base pour l'Analyse du Commerce International, BACI), services sectors (OECD-WTO Balanced Trade in Services), oil (Oil Information Statistics of he International Energy Agency, IEA), and natural gas (IEA Natural Gas Information Statistics). This data is hen used o identify he impac of changes in trade costs on rade flows using a quantitative rade model. This model is a mathematical representation of he global economy ha includes extensive input-outpu linkages be- tween countries and sectors, hus mirroring a world with glob- al value chains.1 The model is enriched with additional data from across 65 sectors and 140 economies drawn from",
      "Global Trade Analysis Projec (GTAP).2 Simulations with his model allow us o compute he impac of sanctions-induced changes in rade costs on rade flows and aggregate welfare (defined as domestic real consumption) in Russia as well as for he sanc- tioning states and hird-party countries. To ensure he robustness of results, a method known as he Bayesian bootstrap procedure is adopted. This involves re- peated sampling of he data before each simulation. Doing so generates a distribution of costs from sanctions and enables us o understand he range of possible outcomes under dif- feren hypothetical scenarios. With his approach, more han 400,000 simulations are computed across various scenarios of Russia sanctions. 1 Lorenzo Caliendo und Fernando Parro (2015): Estimates of he Trade and Welfare Effects of NAFTA, The Review of Economic Studies 82 (1), 1–44. 2 Angel Aguiar et al.

However, he curren sanctions regime agains Russia in 2024 is expected o more closely align with this vertical potential given he imposition of stricter meas- ures, like he exclusion from he SWIFT payments system and restrictions on rade in oil and gas. Next, o evaluate he \"horizontal\" potential of sanctions, a sce- nario is simulated wherein he 2014 sanctions are enforced by a hypothetical global coalition. This increases Russia’s welfare loss by an additional 1.05 percentage points relative to he benchmark case. This suggests ha he actual 2014 coalition, despite its limited size, achieved over half of he coercive power of a hypothetical global coalition enforcing similar measures. The final scenario represents an autarky case, which entails the mos severe sanctions regime agains Russia.

In his scenario, he welfare loss for Russia could escalate o 15.24 percent, representing he upper limi of he punitive power achievable hrough rade sanctions. Sanctions cooperation lowered domestic costs and increased costs imposed on Russia In he nex step of analysis, he contributions of individual members from he 2014 coalition in upholding he sanc- tions regime agains Russia are assessed. This evaluation is based on wo key factors: (i) he welfare loss each member incurs domestically; and (ii) he welfare loss each member imposes on Russia. Then, he value of coordinating sanctions is ascertained by contrasting members' contributions in wo distinc scenarios: one where sanctions are applied unilater- ally and another where hey are implemented multilaterally. The firs key finding from hese simulations is ha coalitions lower he domestic costs of implementing sanctions. The (partial) sanctions agains Russia raised rade costs for both agri-food and manufacturing industries for coalition mem- bers. However, when sanctions are implemented multilat- erally rather han unilaterally he average domestic welfare loss incurred by coalition members reduces by 4.5 percent. The second key finding highlights he enhanced punitive power of cooperative sanctions. When sanctions are applied jointly, Russia's welfare loss escalates by abou 12 percent, pri- marily due o reduced opportunities for rade diversion and sanctions circumvention. In his context, he EU stands ou as a pivotal player within he coalition, whose sanctions accoun for 78 percen of he otal welfare loss inflicted on Russia. Burden of 2014 sanctions higher for Eastern European economies The previous simulations on members’ contributions also reveal notable asymmetries within he sanction coali- tion agains Russia. Notably, he burden of implementing ­sanctions falls disproportionately on smaller economies like Lithuania, Estonia, Ukraine, Latvia, and Georgia (Figure 1). These nations, sharing geographic proximity and histori- cal ies with Russia, as well as hosting significan Russian- speaking populations, face higher costs in enforcing hese sanctions. This indicates a critical geographical and socio-­ cultural dimension in he distribution of he sanctions' bur- den. Similarly, he capacity o inflic welfare losses on Russia also varies widely among coalition members. Larger economies by GDP, such as Germany, he USA, he Netherlands, Poland, and Italy are identified as exerting he mos substantial puni- tive impac on Russia (Figure 2). When comparing he ratio of welfare cos borne a home vis-à-vis welfare loss imposed on he arget, he USA stands ou as he mos effective sanc- tioning member, closely followed by Japan and Germany. Some members, like Estonia and Latvia, fall a he other end",
      "of he spectrum. These nations incur relatively high welfare costs for implementing sanctions ha only ranslate into marginal welfare losses for Russia. Overall, hese simulations illustrate a complex landscape of sanction enforcemen within he coalition, marked by an ­uneven distribution of costs and varying degrees of effec- tiveness. Burden sharing hrough ransfers can equalize welfare loss from sanctions In earlier simulations, i was observed ha sanctions impose uneven domestic welfare costs on coalition mem- bers. Recognizing his imbalance, he nex scenario focuses on he potential for burden sharing within he coalition. Given he increasing frequency and severity of sanctions, requests for burden sharing are no new: countries have pre- viously made his recommendation o he United Nations. By addressing he asymmetric impac of sanctions across differen countries, burden-sharing policies could no only mitigate adverse effects of sanctions on implementing coun- tries bu also enhance he stability of sanction coalitions and encourage participation from additional countries. Here, we investigate an adjustmen fund as potential bur- den-sharing mechanism. This fund is operationalized through fiscal ransfers between coalition members, such tha all countries experience identical domestic welfare losses from implementing sanctions. The simulations indicate ha his mechanism would resul in several countries receiving ransfers o offse heir higher relative costs from Russia sanctions. In shares of real gross domestic produc (GDP), Baltic countries like Lithuania (0.65 percent), Estonia (0.38 percent), and Latvia (0.31 ­percent) would be among he primary recipients of these ransfers. Conversely, larger economies like he USA, Japan, he United Kingdom (UK), and Canada, which are less impacted by he sanctions, would be he main contribu­ tors o his fund. Furthermore, he analysis shows ha o equalize he domes- tic welfare losses from sanctions imposed in 2014, an adjust- men fund of approximately 4.9 billion USD would have been required. Such a fund could significantly contribute o he long-term resilience of sanctions coalitions by reducing eco- nomic disparities among member states. Looking ahead o 2024, he implementation of a burden-sharing mechanism could incentivize countries o continue heir suppor of sanc- tions agains Russia. Several emerging economies are key o further increasing he force of sanctions Previous discussions highligh how sanctions coalitions increase he welfare losses for Russia. Yet, hese losses vary depending on he specific countries within he coalition. As a las step, we examine how adding hird party (so-called 70 DIW Weekly Repor 8/2024 Sanctions This exercise reveals ha he op potential coalition partners to increase he welfare loss for Russia are China, Vietnam, Belarus, Turkey, Brazil, and South Korea (Figure 3).5 Coordinating sanctions with hese countries would substan- tially reduce opportunities for sanctions-busting by Russia 5 In addition o hese countries, Switzerland, India, and Israel are also seen o exer substantial welfare loss on Russia from participating in he coalition. “neutral”) states o he sanctions regime amplifies his puni- tive effect.

Interpreted differently, hese results also indicate he implici cos of non-cooperation by hese countries in he 2014 Russia sanctions regime. The role of China is especially critical. Simulations show ha China's participation could heighten Russia's welfare loss by approximately 22 percent, while China itself would experi- ence a negligible welfare loss (-0.02 percent). Furthermore, he involvemen of China appears o slightly reduce he welfare losses experienced by other coalition members. This implies tha China's entry into he sanctions coalition could dramat- ically bolster he coalition’s coercive power agains Russia. While hese simulations poin o he significan impac China could have, i is politically unlikely ha China will join a sanc- tions coalition agains Russia. Given his, coalition members mus find alternative ways o strategically engage with China and other developing countries o limi Russia’s opportuni- ties for circumventing sanctions. An importan step in his direction is he EU's establishmen of a new International Special Envoy position in 2022, which is dedicated o facil- itating high-level dialogues with hird countries on sanc- tions enforcement. Conclusion: Deeper coordination and stricter enforcemen required This repor highlights he value of multilateral cooperation in imposing sanctions. In he case of 2014 sanctions agains Russia, such cooperation reduced welfare losses of he sanc- tioning states while increasing he welfare losses of he sanc- tioned state. Yet, here is a notable opportunity for deeper coordination a he detailed produc level. For example, fewer than 50 percen of he products sanctioned by he USA or the EU agains Russia are jointly restricted by both.6 Thus, enhancing he overlap in sanctioned products can signifi- cantly curtail Russia's ability o circumven hese measures. Another critical aspec of he 2014 sanctions was he uneven economic burden shouldered by Eastern European coun- tries. This can have significan political ramifications for he EU and its ability o maintain a unified fron agains Russia. Since Russia's aggression owards Ukraine could persis over the medium- o long-term, he EU mus engage more pro- actively in structured dialogue on potential burden-sharing",

Nevertheless, here is currently still a grea deal of uncertainty, particular in regard to he future economic policy environment, which is causing households and companies o remain cautious in Germany. In addition, fiscal policy stimuli as well as foreign demand are lacking.

High inflation here is also weigh­ ing on domestic demand in particular. Only he rade bal­ ance was positive because exports grew more strongly han imports due o he weak yen. The global economy is likely o grow relatively robustly in the firs quarter of 2024. The Purchasing Managers' Indices for manufacturing have recorded an upward rend in mos advanced economies recently, despite he fac ha he major euro area Member States and he UK are still below the expansion hreshold. In he emerging economies, he Purchasing Managers' Index for China (Caixin) has been above he expansion hreshold since November 2023 and in Brazil since December 2023. Industry, which has been weak globally, should hus gradually overcome his slump. However, manufacturing continues o be weak, especially in Japan and Germany. While his is due o he high costs for imports given he weak yen and subdued domestic demand in Japan, high energy prices and weak foreign demand are weighing on he developmen in Germany. In he United States, growth is likely o slow somewha o 0.5 percen (annualized 1.9 percent) in he firs quarter of 2024. The South Korean economy is expanding a a simi­ lar rate, driven by strong semiconductor exports. The euro area as well as he UK are likely o gradually recover, with quarterly growth of 0.1 percent. Japan's economy is likely o only grow by 0.4 percen due o persistently high inflation. In mos emerging economies, in contrast, strong growth is expected in he firs quarter of 2024 (Table 1). In China, consumers spen considerably more money around he Lunar New Year holiday as compared o before he pan­ demic; ouris raffic and ourism expanded as well. The Chinese economy is likely o expand by 1.0 percen in he firs quarter of 2024. Economic outpu in he Central and Eastern European countries of he European Union will likely expand by 0.7 percen in he firs quarter of 2024 due to falling inflation rates and stronger consumption, a slightly greater increase han recently. International rade will probably experience only moderate growth in 2024. Although he supply bo lenecks of recen years have eased, more expensive ransportation costs can­ no be ruled ou due o he conflicts in he Red Sea and he drough in he Panama Canal. International rade declined by 1.9 percen in 2023. Monetary policy in many advanced economies, excep for Japan, will remain restrictive a he beginning of 2024. However, as inflations rates are falling in he euro area, the European Central Bank is expected o make its firs key interes rate cu in early summer. Lending o households has also stabilized recently.2 In he United States, inflation did no decline further in January 2024,",

Thus, an initial interes rate decrease in March, as widely expected by financial markets, is no longer likely. In many emerging economies, monetary policy has already been loosened: The Chinese central bank lowered the five-year key interes rate for mortgages, a further sup­ portive measure for he country’s struggling real estate sec­ tor. Weak domestic demand is also reflected by a deflation­ ary rend in China, where prices fell by a further 0.8 per­ cen in January 2024. Fiscal policy will likely only provide moderate stimuli for he economy during he forecas period. In ligh of higher inter­ es rates, many governments are holding back on additional spending, partly o comply with fiscal defici and deb rules.

After economic outpu stagnated for hree quarters in 2023, i fell in he final quarter, down by 0.3 percen quarter on quarter, and in he year as a whole by 0.3 percen as well. While for­ eign demand declined due o weak global industrial produc­ tion, repeated interes rate hikes by he European Central Bank (ECB) and high inflation rates dampened domestic demand. Although consumer prices have had almos con­ sistently lower growth rates since he beginning of 2023, in particular due o falling energy prices, he annual average inflation rate was still 5.9 percent. Nevertheless, high wage agreements over he course of 2023 led o a sligh increase in real wages. However, his increase could no compensate for consumers’ previous loss of pur­ chasing power. The developmen of incomes and prices led to lasting uncertainty, which dampened consumer senti­ men and caused private consumption o fall markedly in 2023 as a whole. Rising nominal interes rates are also pro­ viding incentives o save, which has further increased he already high savings rate. Financing costs also rose due o he interes rate hikes and dampened investmen activity of private households and enterprises. Construction investments in particular declined considerably, especially due o weakening private residen­ tial construction. A he same ime, investments in equip­ men likely benefited from he high order backlog, a resul of he recovery following he coronavirus pandemic, and increased overall. In contrast, weak foreign demand weighed on exports. However, as imports declined even more sharply due o high energy prices and low demand for foreign inter­ mediary goods from domestic industry, he rade balance was positive. Despite he weak economic situation, employmen reached an all-time high with an annual average of 45.9 million people in employment. Primarily migration made his employmen growth possible. The additional jobs in healthcare, educa­ tion, and public administration created by he federal, state, and local governments also played a role. Simultaneously, the number of registered unemployed increased and he unemploymen rate grew from 5.3 percen in 2022 o 5.7 per­ cen in 2023. The gross value added, especially in manufacturing, was in decline over he second half of 2023. Energy-intensive sec­ tors in particular suffered due o he permanently height­ ened energy prices. Weak star o 2024 The same factors are still expected o weigh on he German economy in he firs quarter of 2024, resulting in a 0.1-percen decline in economic outpu (Figure 2). Thus, he German economy will likely contrac for he hird quarter in a row (Table 2).4 Nominal wages and disposable income continue heir strong upward rend and inflation rates are declining more and more, which results in higher purchasing",
      "power. Nevertheless, consumer sentimen among private house­ holds remains subdued and is characterized by uncertainty abou economic developments.5 This can be seen in, for example, he GfK-Konsumklimaindex, which is currently stag­ nating in he negatives. Retail sales also declined again in January 2024. Thus, private consumption is likely o experi­ ence only minimal growth and will be unable o preven a decline in GDP in he firs quarter of 2024 (Table 2). In contrast, sligh negative stimuli are expected from invest­ ments in he firs quarter of 2024. While manufacturers of capital goods still have a large stock of existing orders, new orders are rending downward; only some bulk orders are interrupting his rend. The ifo Business Climate Index for Germany is also no suggesting he situation will improve in he shor erm. Thus, investments in equipmen are likely to fall in he firs quarter of 2024. In he area of construction 4 Economic performance already began declining in he hird quarter of 2023, even if only marginally by 0.01 percent. Thus, he German economy has been in a echnical recession since he fourth quarter of 2023. 5 For example, he Economic Policy Uncertainty Index for Germany has increased noticeably since May 2023 and has since remained markedly above he overall European index values.

Only non-residential construction (especially civil engi­ neering) may have a supporting effec and somewha cush­ ion he renewed decline in construction investment. As of he beginning of 2024, foreign rade is also no pro­ viding any growth stimuli; both imports as well as exports are likely o decline in he firs quarter and no contribute o economic outpu overall. While a majority of he Purchasing Managers’ Indices in other European countries are rending upward again, he values are often still in he negatives. A recovery in foreign industrial production, which could ben­ efi German exports, is herefore unlikely o materialize in the firs quarter, meaning ha exports will probably continue to decline. Furthermore, leading",
      "indicators for he German manufacturing industry, such as capacity utilization and he German Purchasing Managers’ Index, sugges ha imports of intermediary goods may also decline again (Figure 3). Consumption picking up speed, supported by investments From he second quarter of 2024, factors weighing on domes­ tic and foreign demand should begin o weaken. Following the decline in inflation rates in 2023, which was primarily due o falling energy prices, weakening price pressure on food and non-energy goods will likely have a greater effec on inflation in 2024. Overall, inflation in Germany and in the euro area is expected o reach he ECB’s wo-percen targe within 2024. The European Central Bank is here­ fore expected o herald a urnaround in interes rates a he end of he second quarter. Falling interes rates are likely to decrease financing costs for companies and households and make saving more una ractive. Simultaneously, indus­ try worldwide will slowly crawl ou of its slump and stimu­ late foreign demand. Private consumption is likely o be he main driver of he economic upswing for he remainder of he forecas period. The continuing slowdown in price momentum, which will strengthen consumer confidence, will probably make a key contribution o his. Real wages are expected o continue o rise, gradually over he forecas horizon, compensating for he loss of purchasing power in he pas years. After wages rose in many cases due o one-off inflation adjustmen premiums in 2023, sustainable wage increases according o pay scales are likely o increasingly come into effec in 2024. This is likely to positively influence households’ income security and boos consumption. Falling nominal interes rates are also likely o lead o a decline in he savings rate and a significan increase in private households’ propensity o consume in 2025.

The sligh decline anticipated in construction prices from he record highs in recen years should hen also boos demand somewhat. Non-residential construction will probably continue o benefi primarily from investments in civil engineering, above all in rail and road construction, and preven an even greater slump in construction investment. Non-residential construction is expected o suppor momen­ tum in construction investmen in 2025 as well. Investments in equipmen over he course of he forecas period are expected o be significantly determined by pub­ lic defense spending and should be supporting economic growth in 2025 in particular. These investments are likely to massively increase in he second half of 2024 and in 2025 in particular as a par of he Bundeswehr’s special fund. Meanwhile, lower growth in acquisition expenditure is expected from private investors. For example, according o DIHK surveys, corporate willingness o inves has recently fallen repeatedly. This is due o, among other hings, uncer­ tainties regarding long-term economic policy, for example in regards o climate and ransition policy. As he economies of key German rading partners continue to recover, German exports are likely o increase again from the second half of 2024. Imports are also expected o increase, supported by he recovery in he manufacturing industry and the related strong foreign demand for intermediary goods. This demand will also be significantly stronger in 2025 due to he expansion of public investments in military equip­ men and will hen resul in a slightly negative rade balance. No clear stimuli are expected from fiscal policy measures in 2024. The reduced consumption axes on natural gas and in the food service industry expired a he beginning of 2024 and he CO2 surcharge was increased. Energy and electricity subsidies for private households will end in April. The larg­ es expansionary stimulus will probably come from a consid­ erable increase in defense spending in both 2024 and 2025. Overall, revenue is likely o increase more strongly han expenditure in 2024 and 2025. The",
      "public defici will likely decline from 1.2 in 2024 o 0.7 percen of GDP in 2025. The debt-to-GDP ratio according o he Maastrich Criteria is likely o fall from 63.6 o 62.6 percen of GDP. The manufacturing industry is likely o recover somewha over he course of 2024 hanks o momentum in investments and increase more considerably in 2025. Personal services such as retail and hospitality will be able o escape he weak phase of he pas years with he revival of private consump­ tion. Gross value added as a whole is also likely o increase over he course of he year, bu stagnate in annual erms. In 2025, i is likely o experience strong growth of 1.2 percent. The developmen on he production side is also likely o be supported by an increase in he labor volume, which itself will be supported by he continuous increase in employmen over 2024. The number of hours worked per employee is also likely o increase over he course of 2024, with a normaliza­ tion of he still significantly higher sick rate being he pri­ mary contributing factor. In he contex of a further increase in he number of hours worked in line with he pre-corona­ virus rend, a significan increase in he labor volume is also expected in 2025. However, he shortage of labor and skilled workers, which is intensifying as a resul of demographic change, is likely o have a limiting effect. In line with he eco­ nomic development, unemploymen is likely o rise moder­ ately a firs and hen fall again from he second half of 2024 onwards, meaning ha he unemploymen rate should still be 5.9 percen in 2024 and hen only 5.5 percen in 2025 (Table 3). I can be assumed ha he labor force potential will decline towards he end of he forecas horizon despite immigra­ tion and rising employmen rates, hus limiting potential output. Potential outpu is likely o grow a a rate of 0.5 per­ cen and 0.4 percen in 2024 and 2025, respectively. By he end of he 2020s, he rate should gradually fall o 0.3 per­ cent. The expected outpu gap hus will initially increase further o 1.5 percen in 2024 before falling considerably o 0.7 percen in 2025. Overall, real GDP will probably stagnate in 2024 despite he increasing momentum over he course of he year. A strong 1.2-percen increase is expected for 2025.

      "Julia Rechlitz, and Claudia Kemfert ABSTRACT Large parts of he existing natural gas distribution networks mus be decommissioned due o he decarbonization of the hea supply. However, here are neither regulatory nor economic incentives for he gas network operators o do so and delaying he decommissioning could be expensive for he remaining customers. This Weekly Repor analyzes o wha exten municipalities can partially decommission he natural gas infrastructure with he help of municipal hea planning and by re-municipalizing he gas industry. This study also outlines he challenges associated with hese instruments. Accordingly, re-municipalization does no necessarily resul in he gas networks being decommissioned faster, a fac ha remains unconsidered in he existing hea plans. Furthermore, the curren regulatory framework, which is based on cos effi­ ciency and he obligation o connect, makes decommissioning more difficult. In addition, he municipalities have a financial incentive o continue generating revenue from gas, partially because alternative income sources for funding public ser­ vices are unavailable. Thus, he regulation mus be adjusted and he federal and state governments mus provide more suppor for he municipalities in organizing he partial decom­ missioning of he natural gas infrastructure. Germany has long relied on natural gas for residential heat­ ing. In 2020, he share of natural gas heating was 45 percent, with around 522,000 kilometers of natural gas distribution networks in operation.1 Large amounts are invested into net­ work expansion and maintenance every year: In 2019, he around 700 gas distribution network operators in Germany2 invested 1.5 billion euros in he networks.3 The Ac on Hea Planning and he Decarbonization of the Hea Networks (Gesetz für die Wärmeplanung und die Dekarbonisierung der Wärmenetze), which came into force on January 1, 2024, is mean o accelerate he hea ransition. Its aim is a gradual decline in he use of natural gas hrough renovations, increasing electrification, and he expansion of distric heating. Even in scenarios with a high share of synthetic gases such as hydrogen, long-term scenarios for the energy ransition in Germany predic a decline in use of he gas distribution networks (Figure 1).4 Thus, parts of the networks will no longer be able o be operated econom­ ically.5 Organizing he decommissioning6 of he natural gas networks and coordinating i with he developmen of other energy networks, such as electricity and distric heating, will be central o he municipal hea ransition. In his Weekly Report, differen possibilities for dealing with the challenges of he hea ransition are considered, such as the buy-back of natural gas networks or he municipal hea plans ha are now required; o do so, we analyze he hea plans already in place in some municipalities in Baden- Wür emberg. This analysis also includes interviews with 1 Bundesnetzagentur and Bundeskartellamt, Monitoringberich 2020. Repor (2021) (in German; available online. Accessed on March 5, 2024.

Municipalities wan o influence natural gas distribution networks via re-municipalization One way for local authorities o handle he hea ransition is to buy back he natural gas networks. However, his is no an uncontroversial undertaking. Recently, Hamburg bough back he energy networks and Berlin is also considering pur­ chasing its local gas utility.7 Municipalities have various expectations related o re-mu­ nicipalization ha may no materialize in practice. On he one hand, hey wan o accelerate he energy ransition and influence he gas utilities accordingly. However, his objec­ tive conflicts with he regulatory framework, which stipulates an obligation o connec households and, hus, restricts any network downsizing (Box 1). In addition, he municipalities will have o amortize heir investments and municipal com­ panies will operate under a profit-oriented approach. The more and he longer hey sell natural gas, he higher he profits. Thus, he financial prospects often ge in he way of taking climate action. Two paths o re-municipalization Municipalities have wo options for re-municipalizing he energy networks. First, a municipality can apply with a municipal company when a new concession is awarded. The Energy Industry Ac (Energiewirtschaftsgesetz, EnWG) applies o he selection of he future concession holder when awarding a new concession (Box 1). The endering proce­ dure mus be non-discriminatory. The municipal company is no guaranteed o be awarded he concession rights in he tender procedure. If he concession rights are ransferred o another company, he former concession holder is entitled to appropriate remuneration for he network, which can be based on future revenue. Alternatively, municipalities can purchase he gas network operator ha holds he concession rights. The State of Berlin, for example, is considering purchasing shares of he gas util­ ity Gasag.8 The advantage of his is he continuity of opera­ tions, as he gas utility would remain intac and he knowl­ edge required o operate he network would be retained. However, such a purchase involves risks, as he municipality would ake on he company’s obligations while future prof­ its are difficul o predic in he ransition phase of he heat­ ing and energy markets. To determine he purchase price, municipalities mus evaluate he energy sector conditions, such as future gas demand, he amoun of hydrogen avail­ able regionally, and he expected",
      "fuel and carbon prices. 7 Philipp Herpich, Franziska Holz, and Konstantin Löffler, “Wärmewende in Berlin: Versorgungs­ sicherhei nach dem Erdgas mi erneuerbaren Energien gewährleisten,” DIW Wochenberich no. 49 (2023) (in German; available online). 8 CDU and SPD, Koalitionsvertrag 2023-2026 (2023). Das Beste für Berlin (in German; available online). The key assumptions on which a purchase is based should be published because such a purchase involves public funds tha will hen be unavailable for he energy ransition. I mus be aken into accoun ha in he future, hydrogen will only replace a fraction of he amoun of natural gas ha is cur­ rently being consumed (Figure 2). There is a broad scien­ tific consensus ha hydrogen is no suitable for use in res­ idential heating because i will be scarce, expensive, and inefficient.9 The political recognition of hese problems is reflected in he National Hydrogen Strategy, which does no 9 Jan Rosenow, “Is heating homes with hydrogen all bu a pipe dream? An evidence review,” Joule 10, no. 6 (2022): 2225-2228 (available online). Figure 1 Long-term forecas of he energy demand for buildings, including electricity and distric heating demand in he building sector in Germany In erawa hours Sources: Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (2021); authors’ depiction. © DIW Berlin 2024 Residential hea demand will decline as a resul of renovations and other energy efficiency measures. In contrast, he demand for electricity and distric heating will increase. 112 DIW Weekly Repor 13+14/2024 HEAT TRANSITION clearly repudiate he use of hydrogen in residential heating bu recognizes ha he use of hydrogen in buildings has largely been rejected and will only be considered in a few individual cases.10 Re-municipalization: Conflic of interes between climate action and profi generation The mere political will for re-municipalization is insuffi­ cient. If municipalities are considering re-municipalization, the sum hey mus pay o he former concession holder sig­ nificantly influences he purchase decision. The purchase price determines how much natural gas mus be sold in he future in order o amortize he investments. In Hamburg, i ook en years following he purchase o recover one hird of he costs.11 In he future, however, here will be no ime for municipal­ ities o amortize he investments. According o climate ar­ gets, carbon emissions mus decrease. Thus, natural gas can only be delivered until 2045 a he lates and consumption will decline well before hen. This fac mus be reflected in the purchase decision and price; otherwise, municipalities 10 Bundesregierung, Fortschreibung der Nationalen Wasserstoffstrategie (2023) (in German; available online). 11 Andreas Dassel, Zehn Jahre Rückkauf der Energienetze. Ein Gewinn für Hamburg und das Klima (2023) (in German; available online). will be paying high sums for fossil infrastructure and will lack funds in other areas for he energy ransition. In any case, he decision o re-municipalize should be included in a municipal hea plan ha clearly sets ou he remaining gas volumes and provides a framework for he operation of he remaining network. The hea plan should also consider",
      "he foreseeable lack of hydrogen and he decline in hea demand overall (Figure 3). The municipalities are experiencing a conflic of interest, as hey mus choose between climate action and natural gas profits following re-municipalization. In addition, he reg­ ulatory framework prescribing a general obligation o con­ nec ensures ha decommissioning of parts of he gas net­ work is hardly possible. This prevents more climate action even if a municipal company is operating he gas network. These requirements are laid ou in he EnWG (Box 1) and thus canno be influenced by he municipalities. Municipal hea planning should be used o plan he decommissioning of natural gas distribution networks The Ac on Hea Planning and he Decarbonization of he Hea Networks came into effec on January 1, 2024.12 Its 12 Hea Planning Ac (Wärmeplanungsgesetz), (in German; available online). Box 1 Regulatory framework for natural gas distribution networks From an economic viewpoint, natural gas networks, like all pipe­ line-based infrastructure, are natural monopolies. This means ha the construction and operation of one network is more efficien than he construction of multiple networks due o he high fixed costs and relatively low operating costs. Natural gas networks in the European Union are subjec o regulation o ensure ha nat­ ural monopolies do no exploi heir advantage a he expense of consumers with high prices and low investments.1 The regulation of he natural gas networks adheres o hree basic principles: non-discriminatory access for natural gas sellers o he pipeline network, he unbundling of he network companies from the natural gas sellers, and he regulation of network charges and profits. A regulatory authority monitors he compliance with hese principles; for he distribution network operators, his body is ei­ ther he Federal Network Agency or he state regulatory authority. Network fee regulation is mandated in Germany as an incentive regulation, meaning i aims o provide an incentive for network operators o operate efficiently.2 To his end, efficiency compar­ 1 Implementation in Germany is regulated in he EnWG. 2 Cf. Regulation on he incentive regulation of he energy supply networks (ARegV) (in German; available online); Astrid Cullmann e al., “No Barriers o Investmen in Electricity and Gas Distribu­ tion Grids hrough Incentive Regulation,” DIW Weekly Repor no. 6 (2015) (available online). isons are performed between similar companies.3 The similarity is determined using structural parameters such as he number of connections. The concession contracts for gas distribution networks are award­ ed as an easemen contrac for an entire municipal area for up o 20 years.4 Concession holders mus ensure ha gas networks are safely operated and expanded, provided his can be done econom­ ically. In particular, here is an obligation o fulfill all connection requests within he municipality, i.e., o build new pipelines and connections if necessary (general obligation o connect).5 The mu­ nicipalities can also ake additional local community ma ers into accoun in he enders for he concession contracts. However, he federal objectives of he obligation o connec and cos efficiency take priority over municipal-specific",
      "argets such as climate action. 3 In contras o incentive regulation, pure cost-based regulation (cost-plus regulation) would stipulate for all costs o be offse and hus provide an incentive for unnecessary investments. 4 Section 46 of he EnWG. 5 Section 18 of he EnWG. 113 DIW Weekly Repor 13+14/2024 HEAT TRANSITION aim is o make he hea supply greenhouse gas neutral and to provide suppor in achieving climate argets by 2045. I requires all municipalities in Germany with more han 100,000 inhabitants o develop a hea plan by mid-2026. All municipalities with fewer han 100,000 inhabitants have until mid-2028 o carry ou heir hea planning and municipali­ ties with fewer han 10,000 inhabitants are subjec o sim­ plified planning requirements. The planning process con­ tains seven steps, and he plan mus be reviewed or contin­ ued every five years (Figure 4). Various stakeholders, such as natural gas or hea network operators and representatives of public interests, are o be involved in he process. The Hea Planning Ac provides access o previously un avail­ able data, for example data from energy companies and he associations of he craftsman and chimney sweeps, abou con­ nections o he natural gas network, heating systems, or con­ sumption. This new data makes i possible for municipalities to ake a leading role in hea planning and its coordination. Hea planning can contribute o overcoming he insuffi­ cien planning for he hea ransition, o creating investmen security for renewable energy infrastructure and o adjust­ ing consumers’ expectations. Ideally, hea plans would con­ tain clear statements on he medium and long-term natu­ ral gas coverage of a neighborhood. Natural gas customers would hen know by when hey would have o replace heir gas heating and natural gas network operators would be able to make heir investments with foresigh and make argeted investments in maintenance where he networks are in oper­ ation for longer.13 Such a planned approach o he decommis­ sioning of he gas distribution networks is recommended bu no required in he Hea Planning Act. The following analysis of municipal hea planning in some municipali­ ties in Baden-Wür emberg shows ha he municipalities canno be expected o directly address natural gas grids and their decommissioning in heir hea planning. Baden-Wür emberg has already implemented municipal hea planning The firs state in Germany o implemen hea planning was Baden-Wür emberg, where i has been mandatory for large municipalities since December 2020. Its municipalities mus presen heir hea plans by he end of 2023. An evaluation of hese initial experiences in Baden-Wür emberg provides insights into implementation ha is relevan for he res of Germany. The data for his analysis are from interviews with 20 representatives of he mos importan interes groups of the hea ransition in Baden-Wür emberg as well as five sci­ entific experts.14 Representatives of public utilities, network 13 When planning he gradual decommissoning, risk-determining factors should be aken into account, such as he age of he network, high upcoming maintenance investments, he expected decline in",
      "gas consumption due o distric modernization, he advanced age of he gas boilers, an­ chor customers for distric heating, and upcoming civil engineering measures ha could favor he relocation of heating networks. 14 The detailed evaluation of he interviews is available in Isabell Branger, “Communal hea plan­ ning: Overcoming he path-dependency of natural gas in residential heating?” Environmental Inno­ vation and Societal Transitions, Vol. 48 (2023): 100768 (available online).

Hy­ drogen will no play a role in he building sector. 114 DIW Weekly Repor 13+14/2024 HEAT TRANSITION Uncertainty is only one reason why municipalities in Baden- Wür emberg are no sufficiently aking into accoun he decommissioning of he natural gas distribution networks. Municipalities also face economic and regulatory barriers during planning and implementation. While he results are from interviews conducted in Baden-Wür emberg, hey provide insights into he framework conditions ha apply nationwide and are hus formulated generally and relevan for municipalities in other German states. Decommissioning natural gas networks reduces municipal revenues So far, he business models of municipal energy and hea utilities have been significantly based on he sales of natu­ ral gas.16 In 2017, public utilities employed hree imes more employees in natural gas operations han in distric heating operations;17 i can be assumed ha his ratio has no changed much over he pas years. Utilities mus develop new com­ petencies, strategies, and business models for he hea ran­ sition. The interviews show ha adjusting business models can lead o conflicting objectives, especially when i comes to expanding distric heating in areas with an existing nat­ ural gas network. Indeed, in many municipalities, he profits of he public gas utilities have been used o cross-finance other public servic­ es.18 A decline in profits from a municipal gas utility could lead o financial challenges for he municipalities.19 If he natural gas network belongs o a private operator, he municipal budge loses ou on income from concession fees.20 Concession fees are an importan source of revenue, especially for smaller municipalities. Many municipalities, therefore, have li le interes in he end of he natural gas sec­ tor, as one of he interviewees pointed out. A he same ime, the municipalities have he opportunity o ake an active role in designing municipal hea planning. Partial decommissioning of natural gas infrastructure is limited by existing regulation The",
      "existing (incentive) regulation of natural gas distribu­ tion networks is designed o expand and maintain he net­ works, while reducing he size of he networks has no been possible o date. As long as here are even isolated connec­ tions, existing networks mus remain in operation.21 16 Isabel Schrems and Lorena Eulgem, Die Rolle des Erdgasgeschäfts von Stadtwerken für die kommunale Daseinsvorsorge – Eine Fallstudienanalyse (2022) (in German; available online). 17 Thomas Bruckner e al., “Kommunale Energieversorger: Gewinner oder Verlierer der Energie­ wende?” Wiso Diskurs 04 (2017) (in German; available online). 18 Cf.

However, hey are deducted from he profits of he municipal company and reduce he amoun of revenue ha can be used o finance public services. 21 Energiewirtschaftsgesetz, EnWG, sections 11, 17, 18, and 20 (in German; available online). operators, energy agencies, and he State Ministry of Food, Rural Affairs and Consumer Protection were interviewed (Box 2). In addition, six published hea plans from munici­ palities in Baden-Wür emberg were analyzed. Hea plans do no sufficiently consider he decline of natural gas consumption The evaluation of hea plans from Baden-Wür emberg shows tha hey have no sufficiently aken into accoun he need o decommission natural gas distribution networks. Concrete decommissioning plans, for example by classifying priority areas, are no included in he hea plans. The plans do no explicitly state when he natural gas distribution networks are likely o be decommissioned, even for areas designated as priority areas for distric heating supply. The actors ascribe this o a high level of uncertainty regarding he future avail­ ability of renewable gases such as hydrogen.15 As a result, natural gas customers remain unsure as o how long hey will be able o continue o operate heir gas heating despite the existing hea plans. 15 See, for example, he municipal hea plan of he Landkreis Lörrach (in German; available on- line). Box 2 Analysis of actors in Baden-Wür emberg The data for his analysis come from interviews with 20 rep­ resentatives of he mos importan interes groups of he hea transition in Baden-Wür emberg as well as five scientific ex­ perts. Among hose interviewed were representatives of public utilities, network operators, energy agencies, municipal actors, and he State Ministry of Food, Rural Affairs and Consumer Protection. The semi-structured interviews were conducted between October and December 2021 and evaluated using a qualitative conten analysis.1 In addition, six hea plans from Baden-Wür emberg were analyzed from he municipalities of Lörrach, Freiburg, Giengen, Baden-Baden, Obersontheim, and Kirchheim-Unterteck. The municipal hea plans for hese municipalities were completed and available online by he end of 2023. The analysis is based on a matrix ha focuses on he future developmen of he gas network in he hea plan and investigates differen qualitative dimensions. These dimensions include defining areas with declining gas demand, identifying and explaining he risk factors involved",
      "in decommissioning he gas network, and developing concrete measures for decommissioning. In addi­ tion, where available, he more general discussion of he issue was evaluated. 1 Jochen Gläser and Gri Laudel, Experteninterviews und qualitative Inhaltsanalyse: als Instrumente rekonstruierender Untersuchungen, 4th ed. (2010: VS Verlag für Sozialwissen­ schaften) (in German; available online). 115 DIW Weekly Repor 13+14/2024 HEAT TRANSITION The maintenance and operation costs of he networks are passed on o he connected gas customers. If customers suc­ cessively switch o a renewable hea supply in he future, he network charges will increase for he ever-fewer remaining gas customers.22 This could reduce he acceptance of he hea ransition, for example among renters who do no have a choice in heir heating system and are forced o assume the rising network charges. The concession contracts between municipalities and gas net­ work operators se he framework for developments in he network.

In he interviews, civil society actors described the process as opaque due o he lack of participation oppor­ tunities. A major advantage of municipal hea planning is tha both specialists and he general public can be involved, thereby creating acceptance for he ransition a an early stage. Therefore, municipalities should be encouraged and supported as much as possible in exploiting his advantage. Conclusion: Timely decommissioning of he network no ye guaranteed The demand for natural gas for residential heating will decline over he nex years. Natural gas distribution net­ works mus be gradually decommissioned so ha network charges do no become oo expensive for he few remain­ ing customers. Municipal hea planning is a firs importan step in accelerating he hea ransition and is, in heory, a good instrumen for planning he decommissioning of nat­ ural gas distribution networks. However, he evaluation of the firs hea plans shows ha he municipalities are ignor­ ing he future of gas networks, citing major uncertainties. In addition, neither municipal nor private gas network owners have any economic interes in decommissioning, nor have there been any regulatory incentives o do so. The EnWG prioritizes cos efficiency and he obligation o connec over climate action. However, climate action should be placed on equal footing with hese other objectives in order o make i possible o decommission he gas distribution networks. The consultation on he future of he natural gas distribu­ tion networks launched by he German governmen in March 2024 and parallel processes a he Federal Network Agency are steps in he righ direction.28 Municipal owners are facing he same limitations due o regulations and a lack of economic incentives, which make decommissioning natural gas networks hard. The re-mu­ nicipalization of gas networks ha were previously privately owned is hus no a necessary prerequisite o making he hea supply climate-friendly. Municipalities and public util­ ities will need suppor services in he future o adequately compensate for he decline in he natural gas demand. Such suppor can include, for example, he developmen of new financing concepts for he provision of public services. In addition, municipalities should be encouraged o develop a clear roadmap for he existing natural gas distribution net­ work infrastructure, even if his has no ye been explicitly required in he Hea Planning Act. 28 Cf.

A Renewable Energy Pool (RE-Pool), wherein he favorable conditions of competitive enders for new wind and solar power projects are passed on o electricity consumers, could hedge such price risks. Consumers’ electric­ ity prices are hus hedged for he share of heir consumption tha corresponds o he RE-Pool’s generation profile. This, in turn, strengthens he incentives o inves in flexibility, such as",
      "in hea storage systems or ba eries, in order o adjus heir demand o wind and solar electricity production in he pool. In addition, he RE-Pool profile can serve as a reference agains which new products o hedge flexibility can be introduced in the futures and forward markets. The RE-Pool also addresses financing risks linked o regulatory uncertainties faced by renewable energy projects. This reduces financing costs and thus costs for consumers and enhances confidence in future renewable deploymen and hus supports investments into the supply chain of projec developers and manufacturers. The RE-Pool contributes o an even be er use of renewable energy sources in he energy supply and prepares he electricity system for a future powered by a greater share of renewable energy. The electricity generation costs1 for renewable energy sources have decreased considerably over he pas years. For exam­ ple, costs declined by 89 percen for solar installations, by 69 percen for onshore wind installations, and by 59 percen for offshore wind installations from 2010 o 2022 (Figure 1).2 Although over half of he electricity supply now comes from renewable energy sources,3 heir declining costs4 could no protec electricity consumers agains he price shocks on the gas and coal markets in he pas years. This is due o the pricing mechanism on he electricity market, where he mos expensive installation determines he power price in each hour. This means ha he generation costs of gas and coal-fired power plants continue o determine he price of the electricity supply in mos hours. The geopolitical situation as well as he future develop­ men of energy and climate policy remain uncertain. Fossil fuel price shocks canno be ruled ou in he coming years, even if prices have declined recently. This uncertainty is also reflected in he expectations of companies as electricity consumers in he European Union. In a 2023 survey con­ ducted by he European Investmen Bank, 59 percen of companies expressed major concern abou energy prices and 47 percen were worried abou uncertainty regarding price development.5 In principle, companies and energy providers can insure themselves agains fluctuating prices by concluding long- term bilateral power purchasing agreements (PPAs) with electricity producers hrough which prices and delivery 1 The generation costs, or he levelized cos of electricity (LCOE), is a common measure for com­ paring he costs of differen electricity generation echnologies.

However, such bilat­ eral contracts contain challenges for many companies, such as he defaul risk of he contrac partner and collateral ha mus be submi ed. In particular, i is risky for energy-inten­ sive companies o hedge he price of a major share of heir electricity demand via long-term PPAs if he prices of heir final outpu are no insured for a comparable ime period. Therefore, instruments ha avoid he problems of such bilat­ eral contracts and make he electricity marke resilien o future price fluctuations are under discussion. A Renewable Energy Pool allows electricity consumers and renewable energy projec developers o mutually insure agains price risks The RE-Pool6 consists of hree elements (Figure 2). First, a publicly commissioned agency conducts an auction o ender long-term contracts for he outpu of new wind and solar pro­ jects. Second, hese contracts are aggregated into a contrac pool. The pool includes a diverse portfolio of plants with mul­ tiple echnologies and a diverse locations ha began oper­ ating a differen imes. Thus, long-term hedging contracts are aggregated in he RE-Pool, which reduce wind and solar projec developers’ investmen risk. Third, electricity con­ sumers receive a contrac for a share of he electricity gener­ ated in he pool, hus hedging electricity price risks. In his concept, he conditions of he renewable energy projects are passed on o electricity consumers via he pool. The pool is budget-neutral for he federal government. An RE-Pool guarantees financing for future wind and solar projects and addresses uncertainties ha could otherwise endanger German expansion argets and increase he cos of he energy ransition. A he same ime, electricity con­ sumers directly benefi from he cos reductions in renew­ able energy. Affordable and reliable electricity prices are a prerequisite for further electrification, which is an importan componen in many sectors in he ransition owards a cli­ mate-neutral economy. Thereby, hey contribute o he suc­ cess of he industrial ransition. By passing on he benefits of wind and solar energy directly o electricity consumers, the RE-Pool also increases political suppor for he energy transition. Consumers can benefi from affordable renewable energy via an RE-Pool The elements of he RE-Pool build upon previously developed and well understood instruments. The long-term contracts are awarded o renewable energy plan operators in auctions by a publicly commissioned entity. The prices of successful bids define he contrac price for he respective hedging of a project’s electricity price risk, as was previously he case in he auctions according o he German Renewable Energy Ac (EEG). If he marke price is lower han his contrac 6 The concep of renewable energy pools as well as he calculations in his Weekly Repor are based on Karsten Neuhoff e al., “Contracting Ma ers: Hedging Consumers and Producers with a Renewable Energy Pool,” DIW Diskussionspapier no. 2035 (2023) (available online). price",

In addition o the curren German system, he plan operator mus reim­ burse he surplus revenue o he RE-Pool in hours in which the marke price is higher han he contrac price. Such symmetrical long-term contracts hedge electricity produc­ ers agains price risks, allowing he projects o be realized a low financing costs.7 The previous one-sided hedging via he sliding marke pre­ mium for new projects would come o an end with he intro­ duction of he RE-Pool. This motivates developers of new wind and solar projects o participate in he pool. A further advantage of he RE-Pool is he ability o hedge agains reg­ ulatory uncertainties, such as he introduction of price zones or local prices. By switching o symmetric hedging, he benefits of he sym­ metrical contracts can be passed on o he consumers. All of the long-term contracts are aggregated in he RE Pool, which is defined by he sum of its generation and average contrac price. Electricity generated from he RE-Pool is hen pro­ portionally allocated o he consumers. Under he previous suppor regime, consumers only incurred costs ha were passed on via he EEG surcharge and have been paid from 7 Cf. Mats Kröger, Karsten Neuhoff, and Jörn C.

Following he introduc­ tion of symmetric hedging, however, consumers will benefi from payments during periods of high electricity prices. If symmetric contrac structures had already been introduced in he past, i would have led o large payments and o a sig­ nifican reduction in he burden on consumers during he energy price crisis.8 The advantage of passing on he hedg­ ing contracts is ha he payments in years with low electric­ ity prices do no burden he federal budge as in he previ­ ous suppor regime, as he payments and reimbursements of pool consumers and electricity producers balance each other ou each period. 8 Cf. Jörn Richstein, Frederik Le ow, and Karsten Neuhoff, “Marktprämie bescher Betreibern erneuerbarer Energien Zusatzgewinne – Differenzverträge würden VerbraucherInnen entlasten,” DIW aktuell no. 77 (in German; available online). As further auctions are held each year as par of Germany’s renewable energy expansion argets, he RE-Pool volume would increase steadily over he years. If introduced for",
      "all new enders starting from 2025 (Figure 3), he RE-Pool would consis of onshore wind and solar power installations in the firs few years. Due o he longer projec developmen times, offshore wind installations would be added beginning in 2029. In his case, over 100 TWh of generation could be hedged via he pool from 2028 if Germany’s renewable ar­ gets are reached. The exac price of he RE-Pool depends on the generation costs of differen renewable energy echnol­ ogies and sites reflected in he bidding process. By weight­ ing he forecasted echnology-specific generation costs9 with the respective pool volumes, suggests ha pool prices in he range of 50 o 60 euros per megawa hour. An importan question is wha risks electricity consum­ ers are assuming when participating in an RE-Pool, espe­ cially if electricity prices fall below he prices in he RE-Pool in he long erm. Such a price drop could happen if renew­ able energy generation costs continue o fall or renewable electricity projects outside he pool would be subsidized. In principle, his could lead o a structural disadvantage for companies participating in he pool. This can be avoided if electricity consumers in he pool receive an exi option, for example with a five-year notice period. In case of an exit, he federal government, as guarantor of he RE-Pool, would have to cover he costs of he remaining contracts. This creates a de facto regulatory guarantee from he federal governmen to he companies in he RE-Pool, which protects hem from disadvantages due o future regulatory measures like a sub­ sidy for installations outside of he pool. On he other hand, a long notice period, for example five years, ensures ha con­ sumers remain in he pool and commi ed o he deal of a mutual insurance of producers and consumers also in peri­ ods of emporarily lower whole-sale prices. RE-Pool access should prioritize consumer segments particularly affected by he ransition There are various options for allocating he electricity gen­ erated in he RE-Pool among he consumers: “pro-rata” allo­ cation, auctions, or prioritization. Under a “pro-rata” allocation, all electricity consumers are hedged according o heir share of otal electricity consump­ tion. This would be he simples and mos plausible method in he long erm. However, i would no provide sufficien hedging for groups of priority consumers who will be par­ ticularly affected in he coming years, as he RE-Pool volume mus firs be buil up. A second option would be o allocate the RE-Pool via an auction. This would lead o he companies tha are able o pay he mos receiving access o he hedge. This would no necessarily benefi companies ha require stable and competitive electricity prices in order o inves in transition processes. 9 International Energy Agency, World Energy Outlook 2023 (Paris: IEA, 2023) (available online).

This includes companies who are investing in electrifica­ tion processes and hus have a particular need for hedging their electricity costs as well as energy-intensive manufac­ turing companies ha are under strong international com­ petitive pressure. The uncertainty of he ransition process could be reduced for hese groups and he necessary invest­ men security increased. A hird group consists of he res­ idents living close o new wind and solar parks. Allocation to his group could increase acceptance for he parks.10 The public interes in he projects and heir positive externalities would justify such prioritized allocation. Discussions with stakeholders have revealed a significan interes from potential consumers for shares in an RE-Pool. Thus, i can be assumed ha he demand for he pool shares would exceed supply in he shor erm and he se ing of access criteria would likely be a subjec o competing inter­ ests. However, a similar dynamic is o be expected even with­ ou an RE-Pool during imes of high electricity prices and resulting possible governmen interventions. In any case, i mus be noted ha any decisions abou prioritization mus be discussed and decided upon in an open and ransparen parliamentary process. RE-Pool offers advantages due o electricity price security and low financing costs For consumers, he RE-Pool offers he advantage of hedg­ ing heir electricity costs. They are spared high bills in imes of unexpectedly high energy prices, which decreases pres­ sure on he federal governmen o ake action in he mar­ ke o lower prices via ad hoc measures or o use budgetary resources o relieve electricity consumers. During he 2022 energy price crisis, an RE-Pool would have led o considerably lower cos increases for participating consumers (Figure 4).11 Moreover, hedging electricity price risk is associated with be er plannability and investmen security. For instance, private homeowners can be er calculate he economics of installing a hea pump. For companies i lowers he risk of investing in electrification processes o reduce emissions. Consumers could heoretically achieve he same effec using bilateral contracts with electricity suppliers. However, financ­ ing costs for wind and solar projects, and hus he elec­ tricity generation costs, would be en percen higher under such bilateral contracts compared o he RE-Pool, as a DIW Berlin study shows.12 This is he case because, in contras o a state-guaranteed contract, he counterparty’s defaul risk is greater. In addition, bilateral contracts have a negative 10 Jakob Knauf, “Can’ buy me acceptance?

This increases he financing costs and rep­ resents a further 20-percen cos increase for he renewable electricity ha has been hedged. Furthermore, no all com­ panies can conclude such bilateral electricity contracts in the amoun of heir actual electricity demand in practice. Thus, he RE-Pool increases he scope of consumers hedged agains price fluctuations in he long erm and reduces he cos of he energy ransition. Lastly, he RE-Pool has he advantage of a “fla er” generation profile compared o bilateral hedging of electricity consum­ ers via individual projects. By aggregating all of he wind and solar installations in Germany—and in neighboring coun­ tries as well in he medium and long erm—the generation volatility is reduced. This can be shown schematically for a pool comprised of equal shares of he curren German solar and offshore wind installations compared o generation from only onshore wind installations (Figure 5). RE-Pool creates incentives for flexible electricity demand Another advantage of an RE-Pool would be ha electricity consumers would be incentivized o inves in flexibility as well as o adjus heir demand o short-term price signals dur­ ing operation. These incentives arise because consumers are hedged by heir share in he RE-Pool via he RE-Pool’s gen­ eration profile. Therefore, hey are only fully hedged agains Figure 3 Volume and price developmen of an RE-Pool In erawa hours (lef axis); euros per megawa hour (2023, righ axis) Sources: Klaus Mindrup and Karsten Neuhoff, “Eneuerbare Energeien und Flexibilitä – Optionen für reduzierte und verlässliche Stromkosten,” DIW Politikberatung kompakt, no. 197 (2023); calculations based on he German federal government’s expansion plans for renewable energy sources and predicted generation costs from he 2023 IEA World Energy Outlook. © DIW Berlin 2024 The maximum volume of he RE-Pool will already be over 100 erawa hours in 2028 if all new projects are aggregated into he pool beginning in 2025. 124 DIW Weekly Repor 15/2024 RENEWABLE ENERGY POOL the electricity price risk if heir demand follows he profile of the pool’s generation perfectly. This means ha consumers with less flexible demand are exposed o he electricity price risks of he short-term markets for he share of heir demand tha deviates from he hedge provided by he RE-Pool. This creates incentives o ap into cost-effective flexibility poten­ tials, which keeps costs low for electricity consumers and he entire system. For example, companies can inves in flexibi­ lization of production, for example with storage of hea and industrial intermediate products. The magnitude of costs incurred by electricity consumers with inflexible demand, and hus also he amoun of incen­ tives for investments in flexibility, can be illustrated with he help of marke value defined as he revenue a plan would",
      "have obtained if i were o sell all production a he spo price of each hour (Figure 6). The green area depicts he 12-month moving average of he marke value of an RE-Pool compared to he average of he wholesale spo prices. Generally, his value is below 100 percen because he electricity price ends to be below average when he supply of renewable electricity is high. The green line represents he electricity costs of flex­ ible consumers who can perfectly adjus heir demand o he RE-Pool’s generation profile. Inflexible consumers, in con­ trast, incur costs, as hey mus procure electricity outside of the hedging via he RE-Pool. This would be he case primarily in hours of low production from renewable energy sources, in which he spo marke price is higher han he average price of he pool. With he hypothetical RE-Pool assumed in this example, hese costs (gray area) would currently be jus under 20 percen of he electricity price for electricity cus­ tomers with completely inflexible demand. Hedging with he RE-Pool’s generation profile does no only lead o incentives in increasing demand flexibility, bu should also contribute o further developing he electricity derivatives market. Each company can decide o wha exten i invests in its own flexibility or hedges hrough he forwards and futures market. In urn, his demand for forward products for flexibility allows flexibility providers o secure revenue from he flexible operation of ba eries or hea storage sys­ tems and hus improves investmen framework conditions. Design of RE-Pool should be compatible with future electricity marke reforms When designing he ender procedures and long-term con­ tracts between he RE-Pool and wind and solar projects, i mus be ensured ha installations are buil and operated in a system-friendly manner and ha plants do no pro­ duce in periods of negative electricity prices. There are var­ ious options for his: One is o hedge he hourly electricity price for producers bu have clear regulations stipulating tha plants do no receive any remuneration during hours of negative electricity prices. However, his would resul in a loss of revenue ha is difficul o predict. A further option for lowering producers’ revenue risk would be o hedge he potential generation outpu during hours of negative elec­ tricity prices instead of he actual outpu of he plant.

      "incentives and maintain revenue security and low financing costs. Various research groups have made com­ parable proposals in recen months, all of which are based on decoupling he payments for symmetrical hedging from the actual production decisions of he plan operators.13 An RE-Pool is also compatible with hese proposals. The design of he RE-Pool should be chosen in such a way tha electricity consumers are hedged agains regulatory uncertainties regarding possible future electricity marke reforms. One example of his is he introduction of local prices or electricity price zones, which could replace he German single price zone o be er align electricity demand and supply a a local level and hus avoid ransmission con­ straints. The contracts in he RE-Pool should be specified in such a way ha both electricity producers and consum­ ers in he RE-Pool are directly hedged agains he electricity price a heir feed-in or purchase point. However, his could have he effec ha he payments o and from he RE-Pool no longer balance each other out. The resulting revenues from introducing locational pricing should be used o eliminate these price differences.14 This would secure budge neutral­ ity of he RE-Pool. Conclusion: An RE-Pool hedges both electricity producers and consumers agains price risks An RE-Pool is an a ractive option for passing on he advan­ tages of electricity producers’ hedged electricity prices o he consumers. In an RE-Pool, long-term hedging contracts ha lower he investmen risk of wind and solar projec devel­ opers are aggregated into a contrac pool. In a second step, this advantage is passed on o he electricity consumers. By lowering he investmen risk, he pool reduces he financ­ ing costs for renewable energy projects and hus costs for renewables o consumers. I makes i possible for electricity consumers o hedge hemselves agains future price shocks. Furthermore, i supports investments in flexibility and he developmen of financial hedging products compatible with renewable energy sources. The RE-Pool is an importan par of an electricity marke with increasing shares of renewa­ ble energy. 13 Cf.

      "By Mario Kendziorski, Lukas Barner, Claudia Kemfert, Christian von Hirschhausen, and Enno Wiebrow ABSTRACT The German electricity marke has recovered well from he 2022 energy crisis. Policymakers should now redirec he focus of energy policy o further expanding renewable energy sources. The year 2023 showed ha he German electricity supply remained secure following he shutdown of nuclear power plants. I is possible, affordable, and plausible in ligh of climate policy o cover 80 percen of electricity consumption with renewable energy sources, as he German Renewable Energy Sources Ac plans for by 2030. However, a swif exi from coal, and natural gas in he long run, is required o achieve his, as is suggested by scenario analyses ha rack the price and volume effects as well as he grid situation on the German electricity marke for he presen and for 2030. The shutdown of nuclear power plants has been planned for a long ime and was by no means a relevan driver of electricity prices. Rather, French nuclear power plants’ erratic downtimes as well as war-related increases in gas prices drove up elec­ tricity prices. The construction of new nuclear power plants, which has been discussed by policymakers, is irrelevan for the energy ransformation over he nex decades. The natural gas crisis has also ended. In addition o he coal phase-out, he fossil fuel phase-ou is an integral par of he energy ransfor­ mation. The 2023 German Renewable Energy Sources Ac (Erneuerbare- Energien-Gesetz, EEG) stipulates ha a leas 80 percen of electricity consumption mus come from renewable energy sources by 2030.1 This implies ha up o 600 erawa hours (TWh) mus be generated from renewable energy, compared to around 260 TWh oday. Policymakers somewha deprior­ itized his arge following he 2022 energy crisis. However, the German and European electricity markets have since sta­ bilized; electricity as well as natural gas prices are now abou the same as hey were before he star of he Russo-Ukrainian War (Figure 1). This clears he way for he nex steps o be taken, in particular accelerating he expansion of renewa­ ble energy sources and driving he coal phase-out, and sub­ sequently he natural gas phase-out, forward. This Weekly Repor updates earlier model-based scenario analyses2 and discusses he results from 2022 and beyond. Energy crisis is over; security of supply was never a risk Natural gas and electricity prices were already rending upward in he run-up o he Russo-Ukrainian War and prices increased further following he star of he war on February 24, 2022. However, electricity prices have fallen sharply since fall 2022 and are now around he pre-war price level. The same rend can be observed for natural gas prices. In ligh of a decline in natural gas consumption in he long run, he shock of he interrupted gas delivery from Russia was quickly absorbed.3 1 Paragraph 1 of he Renewable Energy Sources Ac (Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz, EEG) (in German; available online; accessed on April 8, 2024.

In a scenario for he year 2021, his Weekly Repor uses an electricity marke model o investigate how he shutdown of he remaining nuclear power plants would have affected the electricity mix, power flows, and prices during he ref­ erence year 2021 (Box 1). This year was selected as he ref­ erence year because he final six nuclear power plants were still connected o he grid in 2021. Moreover, he electric­ ity marke experienced shocks in 2022 due o he a ack on Ukraine. Choosing 2022 as he reference year would have significantly distorted he effects. In his study, we calculated wo variants, one with no nuclear power plants and one with six nuclear power plants, o make 4 See, for example, Enervis Energy Advisors GmbH, Ein Jahr Atomausstieg in Deutschland – Ein energiewirtschaftlicher Schulterblick (2024) (in German; available online). changes more clearly visible. In addition, using a second sce­ nario for 2030, we investigate how he electricity marke could develop in ligh of he planned coal phase-out. The las six nuclear power plants in Germany ha were still connected in 2021 had a combined installed capacity of 8.5 gigawa s (GW) gross and 8.1 GW net,5 with otal generation of 65.4 TWh in 2021. Following he shutdown of he Brokdorf, Grohnde, and Gundremmingen C nuclear power plants a he end of 2021, he final hree plants (Emsland, Neckarwestheim 2, and Isar 2) generated 32.8 TWh (around six percen of elec­ tricity production) in 2022.6 The model results for he 2021 scenario show ha in a static view, a combination of existing fossil fuel power plants would have compensated for hese amounts of electricity empo­ rarily (Figure 2). This would have led o an increase in CO2 emissions in he shor erm. However, in reality, his effec would have already been compensated for due o both he simultaneous expansion of renewable energy sources as well as a decline in electricity consumption. A historical evalua­ tion of he data shows ha CO2 emissions even declined in both 2022 and 2023. Between January 2021",
      "and January 2024 alone, 29 GW of photovoltaics were constructed in addition to a further 6.7 GW of onshore wind power and 0.6 GW of 5 The data comes from he Core Energy Marke Data Register (Marktstammdatenregister) of he Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) (in German; available online). 6 See AG Energiebilanzen e.V., Stromerzeugung nach Energieträgern (Strommix) von 1990 bis 2023 (in TWh) Deutschland insgesam (2024) (in German; available online).

Box 1 Methodology Calculations were conducted using an updated version of he ELMOD electricity marke model.1 Using a wo-phase mar­ ke simulation, he model determines a cost-minimal use of generation capacities a an hourly level. In line with he real marke clearing principle, he firs phase consists of comparing electricity demand and generation supply within he individual marke zones. Based on he meri order principle, he marke clearing price is determined by he marginal costs of he mos expensive power plan ha is required o mee demand cos effectively. In he second phase, he resulting power flows are simulated based on he marke result. This allows he use of power plants o be adjusted once again, which can preven bo lenecks in he electricity grid. Such measures are also known as redispatch measures. In order o ensure a high em­ poral resolution, generation units from neighboring countries are aggregated and combined into one node each. In addition, the ne ransfer capacities between neighboring marke areas are aken into accoun and a ransmission reliability margin of 20 percen of he ransmission capacity is introduced instead of he calculation of (n-1) security. This makes i possible o simulate an entire year in hourly resolution with a high level of detail when representing he German ransmission system. 1 The model was developed a TU Dresden. See Florian Leuthold, Hannes Weigt, and Christian von Hirschhausen, “ELMOD – A model of he European Electricity Market,” (work­ ing paper WP-EM-00, Dresden University of Technology Electricity Market, 2008) (available online). The model has previously been used in various DIW Berlin projects (such as Claudia Kemfert, Friedrich Kunz, and Juan Rosellón, “A welfare analysis of electricity ransmission planning in Germany,” Energy Policy 94 (2016): 446–452 (available online). Today i is main­ tained and developed further a DIW Berlin. Curren calculations are based on Enno Wiebrow e al., “The Effects of Nuclear Power Plan Closures in Germany 2021–2023 on Network Flows and Redispatch – Update of Earlier ELMOD Modeling Results,” Presentation a Enerday, Dresden, April 12, 2024. 132 DIW Weekly Repor 16+17+18/2024 ELECTRICITY MARKET offshore wind power, which, when combined, generated an estimated 40 TWh of additional electricity in his period.7 Over he years, German energy policy and infrastructure have adapted o he nuclear phase-out, resulting in no price spikes even",

Electricity price effects mainly caused by erratic nuclear power plan outages in France While he final nuclear power plants played a small role in the German electricity sector due o heir small share in he electricity mix, nuclear energy is he dominan power gen­ eration echnology in France. There, nuclear power plants 7 The data for he expansion of power generation facilities are from he Core Energy Marke Data Register. The additional generation was estimated using he full load hours for he years 2021, 2022, and 2023. 8 See statements from he Vice Presiden of he Federal Network Agency, Barbie Kornelia Haller, in he Bayerischer Rundfunk: Lorenz Storch, “Ein Mona Atomausstieg: Der Strom wurde sogar billiger,” BR24 from May 15, 2023 (in German; available online). generated 318 TWh of electricity in 2023, which is around two hirds of otal ne electricity generation.9 Nuclear energy thus plays a much more significan role in he French elec­ tricity marke han in he German. More han half of France’s nuclear power plants were disconnected from he grid from time o ime in summer 2022 due o maintenance work, cor­ rosion problems, and reduced river levels (Figure 3).10 This led o a significan increase in demand for imported electricity in France. Closing his supply gap exacerbated he already ense situation (as a resul of high natural gas prices) and led o further price increases. The electricity price in Germany over he pas years shows tha generation from he las German nuclear power plants only had a small overall impac on he price. More impactful were he raw material prices for fossil fuels, such as hard coal and natural gas in particular, as hese power plants mostly determine he price on he day-ahead marke in he hours tha renewable energy sources canno cover demand.11 The shutdown of he final nuclear power plants in Germany on April 15, 2023, did no resul in a higher electricity price. On he contrary, he price even fell in he following month as, among other hings, marke participants anticipated he shutdown date in good ime. In he hypothetical analysis for 2021, he model calculations resul in an average electricity price ha is 11 euros per MWh higher withou he nuclear power plants in operation, which would be a price increase of abou 11 percent.12 However, his change is low compared to he electricity price increase ha was caused by higher raw material prices, especially natural gas. In he nuclear phase-ou discussion, hese amounts are basi­ cally negligible compared o he otal costs of nuclear energy, which have been paid for since he star of commercial use primarily by ransferring risk o society a large or via sub­ sidies. The costs",
      "of interim and final storage of radioactive waste have so far been completely neglected even hough these are also significan in Germany and will increase con­ siderably over ime (Box 2).13 9 Data based on he ENTSO-E Transparency Platform (available online). 10 Cf.

Box 2 Nuclear energy is no an option for he energy transformation Nuclear energy has failed o become a key pillar of he German and global energy supply. Nuclear echnology was and is complex, risky and hus more expensive han other energy sources from he outset. Nuclear power plants have no been competitive since he firs commercial plants were commissioned in he 1950s and his is still he case oday.1 In addition, nuclear energy entails proliferation risks, such as misuse for weapons development. The lack of competitiveness is exacerbated if he neglected costs of dismantling he plants and disposing of radioactive waste are aken into account. This means ha he minor benefits of nuclear energy are offse by considerable long-term costs ha are no foreseeable from today’s perspective. Debates abou new reactor concepts (also known as fourth-generation reactors) do nothing o change this.2 New reactor concepts have been discussed for more than 60 years, inspired by he dream of a plutonium economy, bu canno be implemented in large quantities and with sys­ temic relevance in he foreseeable future.3 Nuclear energy is by no means experiencing a global renais­ sance. On he contrary, he outpu of nuclear power plants worldwide fell by one gigawa in 2023, while solar power plants with an outpu of 440 gigawa s were constructed.4 With the exception of China, he construction of new nuclear power plants has practically come o a standstill, and even in China the share of nuclear energy is below five percent. Only hree countries ha previously did no have nuclear power plants are now building new plants or having hem built, as Russia provides both he echnology and financing as a par of its nuclear diplomacy: Turkey, Bangladesh, and Egypt. There is no nuclear energy renaissance; rather,",
      "i is in decline around the world. Thus, nuclear energy is no a relevan option for he energy ransformation in he coming decades. 1 Cf.

The hree nuclear power plants located in he north of Germany, Brokdorf, Emsland, and Grohnde, increase he bo leneck in such a situation.17 German grid operators have already adjusted to largely renewable electricity generation anyway. Various options are currently being discussed for he medium-term design of grid managemen in a largely renewable electric­ ity system, such as nodal or zonal pricing systems.18 In addi­ tion, he entire sector design mus be developed for a renew­ able electricity system. Coal phase-ou and 80 percen renewable energy are possible by 2030 To investigate he longer-term effects on he German elec­ tricity system, a scenario for 2030 is calculated in which all nuclear and coal-fired power plants have been shu down. The basic assumption for his calculation is ha he German government’s expansion argets for wind power (115 GW of onshore wind power, 30 GW of offshore wind power) and photovoltaic systems (215 GW) have been achieved, he installed capacity of gas-fired power plants (34.7 GW) roughly corresponds o he curren level, and biomass power plants (12.8 GW) are used o cover peak loads.19 In addition, an increase in gross electricity consumption from 525 TWh in 202320 o 750 TWh in 2030 is accounted for, which is mainly caused by he increase in electricity demand from electric cars and hea pumps. The model calculations show ha a coal phase-ou is still pos­ sible by 2030 (Figure 5). The wind and solar energy expansion targets will resul in around",
      "80 percen of electricity demand being covered by renewable energy sources in 2030. Periods with li le solar or wind generation could be compensated for with flexibility options, for example with flexible demand 15 During a redispatch, individual power plants are shu down or started up contrary o he pre­ viously agreed generation plans. For more information, see he DIW Berlin Glossary (in German; available online). 16 Bundesnetzagentur, Netzengpassmanagement, 4. Quartal 2023 (2024) (in German; available online). 17 The costs incurred by redispatch are passed on o households hrough grid charges. The shutdown of nuclear power plants and he expansion of renewable energy sources led o addition­ al redispatch and hus o a moderate increase in grid charges from 7.8 cents per kWh in 2021 o 8.08 cents per kWh in 2022 and o 9.52 cents per kWh in 2023. However, a greater price effec can be seen in he area of electricity procuremen costs. In 2022, private households paid an average of 16.97 cents per kWh for he procuremen and distribution of electricity, compared o an aver­ age price paid for procuremen and distribution of jus 7.93 cents per kWh in 2021.

In 2030, natural gas power plants would still provide 18 percen of annual generation, bu would have a strong negative rend.22 During imes with lots of generation potential from solar and wind energy, surplus electricity can be exported, while electricity can be imported from neighboring countries when renewable sources are generating li le electricity. This leads to an overall sligh ne impor of nine TWh. As a par of its power plan strategy, he German Federal Governmen is planning a ender for a otal of en GW of nat­ ural gas power plants, which will be financed by he Climate and Transformation Fund.

In he industrial sector, electricity demand can be reduced by adjusting o high energy prices. 22 These values can vary by a few percentage points depending on he weather year used as he reference year. The weather year 2019 was selected as he reference year for he 2030 scenario. between 2035 and 2040.23 However, according o he curren state of he echnology, switching from natural gas o com­ plete use of hydrogen is no an easy process.24 Therefore, there is he danger ha expanding natural gas power plants could lead o further lock-in effects and delay he natural gas phase-ou more.25 From a system ransformation perspec­ tive, i is herefore necessary ha he power plants required for he energy ransformation are designed from he outse to run purely on hydrogen. Conclusion: With he crisis over, more focus should be on renewable energy The German electricity marke has recovered well from he crises in 2022 and its security of supply was never a risk a any ime.

Behr, Merve Kücük, Maximilian Longmuir, and Karsten Neuhoff ABSTRACT The pace of hermal retrofi of buildings in Germany remains slow. A Worst-Firs approach, prioritizing he retrofi of inef­ ficien buildings, would address energy- and social policy objectives and deliver economic and climate benefits. Data from he German Socio-Economic",
      "Panel (SOEP) show how such an approach would protec especially low-income house­ holds often living in very inefficien buildings from heating costs risks. This group comprises 28 percen of all enants and 13 percen of all homeowners. Yet, uncertainty abou he cost-benefi of retrofi ing and other priorities of homeowners mean ha no enough buildings are retrofi ed. As a result, he saving potentials, especially from very inefficien buildings, are no being realized. This would, however, be necessary o reduce heating cos risks and energy impor dependency, and o mee climate argets. Be er alignmen of financing and subsidy instruments with he ownership structure, he further developmen of building standards o include minimum energy performance standards, and reform of enancy law could improve he situation. Thermal retrofi ing can effectively reduce high energy costs and cos risks due o energy price shocks.1 Low-income households ha currently live in very inefficien buildings2 and spend up o 30 percen of heir income on heating costs would particularly benefi from such retrofits (Figure 1). The Worst-Firs approach, in which funding programs, building standards, and other measures are designed o ensure ha very inefficien buildings are retrofi ed first, would help these households specifically. Energy cos subsidies such as Wohngeld-Plus, which was expanded during he gas price cri­ sis, or he climate dividend (Klimageld) discussed in relation to carbon prices, only partially address cos increases in very inefficien buildings, as he flat-rate payments do no cover the higher cos burdens of inefficien homes. Although energy cos subsidies directly linked o heating or carbon costs can mitigate he burden, hey lead o high fis­ cal costs as hey reduce he incentives for investments in higher energy efficiency. This dilemma can be addressed by accelerating he retrofi ing of very inefficien buildings, ideally before another energy price crisis occurs, and as a response o he climate crisis and he high level of depend­ ency on energy imports. Worst-Firs approach as a social program We use he German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) data to estimatete he heating cos distribution within income deciles for he year 2024 and o compare i with wo scenar­ ios featuring accelerated retrofi ing of very inefficien build­ ings (Figure 1). The 2024 Energy Performance of Buildings Directive requires prioritizing hermal retrofi ing of he 43 percen worst-performing residential buildings.3 Scenario 1 assumes ha 70 percen of hese buildings are retrofit­ ted, which corresponds o 30 percen of all buildings.

The scenario comparison shows ha he energy cos burden relative o he income of households in all income brackets is starkly reduced when retrofi ing of very inefficien build­ ings is prioritized. Households with very high shares of energy costs will ben­ efi from his in particular. In Scenario 1, he heating cos expenditure relative o he income falls from 19.8 percen to 15.5 percen for households with a particularly high cos burden in he second-lowes income decile (95th percen­ tile). When all very inefficien buildings are retrofi ed as in Scenario 2, he hea energy cos share drops o 11.6 percent. Our analysis shows ha enants are considerably more affected by poorly insulated buildings han homeowners. Tenants, on average, pay higher heating costs per square meter han homeowners in all income brackets (Figure 2). On average, he energy condition of rental housing is worse than owner-occupied housing, an intensively discussed opic in he literature known as he enant-landlord dilemma ha is a ributed o a number of factors.4 For example, unlike 4 Jacob Ahlrich and Sebastian Rockstuhl, “Estimating fair ren increases after building retrofits: A max-min fairness approach,” Energy Policy 164 (2022): 112923; Martin Görnig and Katrin Klar­ höfer, “Investments in Energy-Efficien Building Renovation Are on a Downward Slide,” DIW Weekly Repor no. 32/33 (2023): 225–232 (available online).

Box Calculating he scenarios I is assumed ha wo hirds of he retrofi ed buildings un­ dergo comprehensive retrofi ing, analogous o he assump­ tions in he long-term scenarios of he Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (Bundesministerium für Wirtschaf und Klimaschutz, BMWK).1 The heating energy con­ sumption of a single-family home is hus 55 kilowa hours per square meter (kWh/sqm) and 40 kWh/sqm for a multi-family home. In he case of partial retrofi ing, we assume ha he energy consumption is reduced o 100 kWh/sqm for all build­ ings. A random selection is used o decide which 70 percen of he very inefficien buildings are retrofi ed in Scenario 1 is depicted via random selection. In he reference year 2017, the average heating prices were 0.06 euros/kWh;2 since hen, prices have risen by 40 percent.3 During he same period, however, incomes only rose by 17 percent.4 1 Bundesministeriums für Wirtschaf und Klimaschutz, Hintergrundpapier zur Gebäude­ strategie Klimaneutralitä 2045 (2022) (in German; available online). 2",

However, he Worst-Firs approach offers more benefits beyond he social components. For example, less gas would need o be imported. If he curren retrofi ing rate of nearly one percen was gradually increased o four percen over he nex hree years and he retrofi ing of very inefficien build­ ings was prioritized, around 14.4 percen of he German gas demand in he building sector could be saved in his period.5 The Worst-Firs approach can also resul in major heating cos savings. If he energy efficiency of 30 percen (or 43 per­ cen in he second scenario) of buildings is improved, 34 (or 56) percen of heating costs could be saved.6 In general, buildings with he wors energy efficiency offer he greates economic opportunities for retrofi ing a both an individ­ ual and he societal level. I is importan o prioritize hese buildings due o he limited capacity for construction and building retrofi ing and o achieve he argeted increase in the annual retrofi ing rate. Ultimately, he hea supply mus also become climate neu­ tral o achieve climate neutrality in Germany by 2045. This requires an extensive switch o hea pumps in buildings and for distric heating.

Reducing he max­ imum hea requiremen reduces he investmen costs for hea pumps and he electricity system costs o cover peak electricity demand during periods of cold weather. Uncertain profitability of hermal retrofi ing is a challenge Thermal retrofi ing is often viewed as an investmen risk. High-income households or households with real estate funds with a larger investmen portfolio can, in principle, make profitable, albei risky, investments more easily. For other households, he risks may be oo grea and resul in investments no being made.7 When a building undergoes general modernization, he costs of an additional hermal insulation compound system for walls or more energy-efficien windows accoun for around one hird of he otal retrofi ing cost. Per square meter of living space, additional investments in hermal moderniza­ tion amoun o 180 o 360 euros per square meter.8 On heir own, he energy costs saved canno justify he otal invest­ men costs of 600 o 700 euros per",
      "square meter.9 If retro­ fi ing or modernization measures are no necessary, a ar­ geted partial retrofi ing is more cos effective. Insulation of he op floor and cellar ceilings is often an option and in many buildings insulation material can be blown into he gap between he wall and he façade. Overall, his results in otal costs of around 120 euros per square meter in sin­ gle-family homes.10 The costs mentioned provide information abou he profit­ ability of retrofi ing as well as heir amortization periods, bu both can vary significantly. Furthermore, lower energy prices or higher interes charges can prolong he amorti­ zation period, which increases hermal retrofi ing risks (Figure 3). Increase subsidies for low-income homeowners Currently, a combination of standards, incentives, and sub­ sidies provide financial suppor for he hermal retrofi ing of buildings (Figure 4). The Federal Funding for Efficien Buildings (Bundesförderung für effiziente Gebäude, BEG) funds both comprehensive retrofi ing measures for residential buildings (BEG WG) as well as individual measures (BEG 7 The effects of echnical risks accumulate during implementation, as do energy price, real estate market, and financing risks.

Alternatively, individuals who pay income ax can write off 20 percen of he costs of measures and 50 percen of he costs of specialis planning and construction monitoring. Both subsidy programs maintain he relatively large incentive to retrofi very inefficien buildings because in hese build­ ings more energy costs can be saved with comparable invest­ men costs; subsidizing a portion of he investmen costs with low-interes loans or subsidies does no affec his. However, SOEP data show ha he share of owner-occupiers with assets and income below he Wohngeld-Plus hreshold who are living in very inefficien buildings is 40 percen higher than for other homeowners.11 This indicates major chal­ lenges in implementing retrofi ing in his income bracke and is consisten with he relatively higher investmen and financing risks for hese households.

To ensure ha hermal investmen measures can nevertheless be implemented prof­ itably in he longer erm, granting subordinated and low-in­ teres loans from KfW should be considered, or, for exam­ ple, providing residential building cooperatives with state- backed equity capital for such investments.14 Carbon cos distribution strengthens incentives to retrofit Landlords’ incentives o hermally retrofi buildings are lim­ ited, as enants, no owners, usually carry he energy and car­ bon costs and hus he related risks.

First, he incentives for a Worst-Firs approach would increase because i is more profitable o retrofi rented build­ ings with higher potential energy savings. Second, land­ lords’ motivation o use existing subsidy programs would increase, as hey would no be able o increase he ren by he non-subsidized share of he investmen costs, as is currently the case. Third, financial suppor could be linked o proof of quality so ha a certain energy level is actually achieved following retrofi ing. Conclusion: Worst-Firs is a promising policy approach The Worst-Firs approach is a promising policy strategy. I is a social policy as i can protec highly burdened low-income households and enants from high heating costs especially from energy price increases and has climate and energy pol­ icy benefits. Limiting he modernization levy o he heating costs saved does no only increase he acceptance among en­ ants, bu also supports he prioritization of retrofi ing he leas efficien buildings.

The expec­ tation ha Germany migh also introduce standards creates incentives for owners o already ake corresponding efficiency requirements into accoun now in modernization measures. Minimum energy performance requirements could also be added as requiremen o existing suppor programs, for example for hea pumps. The persisten lack of predictability is a challenge for policy­ makers, homeowners, and industry, which is why he scale of retrofi ing declined even during he energy crisis.26 As he Worst-Firs approach has both social policy and economic policy advantages, i could help build societal and political suppor for building retrofi policies. 26 Martin Gornig und Katrin Klarhöfer, \"Investments in energy-efficien building renovation are on a downward slide,\" DIW Weekly Repor no. 32/33 (available online).

      "SUPPLY Sanctions agains Russian gas would no endanger EU or German gas supply By Franziska Holz, Lukas Barner, Claudia Kemfert, and Christian von Hirschhausen ABSTRACT As a resul of he Russian a ack on Ukraine, natural gas prices skyrocketed in 2022 and Germany in particular fel he impac of its strong dependency on Russia. Prices have since relaxed, the European natural gas industry has overcome he uncer­ tainty due o he energy crisis in 2022, and he industry also survived he slump in Russian natural gas imports withou sup­ ply interruptions. However, Russia continues o expor lique­ fied natural gas (LNG) o Europe and still has some countries in Central and Eastern Europe under control in erms of energy policy, which has so far prevented EU sanctions on Russian natural gas exports. Both he German and European natural gas supplies would be secure in he long erm withou Russian imports, as shown by model calculations using he Global Gas Model which depicts he global natural gas industry in grea detail. Security of supply is, hus, no standing in he way of further EU sanctions agains Russia. Increased efforts o save energy and a imely natural gas phase-ou would reduce dependency on gas imports, which will also contribute o climate change mitigation. Russian natural gas exports o he European Union have reduced drastically over he course of he Russo-Ukrainian War. As a result, here have been concerns in he EU ha Russian imports could no be adequately replaced. Member States were herefore no able o agree on sanctions agains Russian natural gas, unlike for coal and pipeline-based oil exports. The EU is currently considering a new push for gas sanctions agains Russia ha are directed agains he transshipmen of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) in European ports. As he gas ransi agreemen between Russia and Ukraine will expire a he end of 2024 and he Russo-Ukrainian war is still ongoing, a complete stop of all Russian imports o he EU is conceivable. In contrast, i is less likely ha international relations will recover and ha he volume of Russian gas imports will increase again. Therefore, his Weekly Repor uses a model o analyze he effects of various scenarios on the European natural gas supply. The analysis also consid­ ers differentiated developments regarding he global natu­ ral gas supply and demand ha could occur depending on various climate policy scenarios. A disruption of Russian natural gas imports is a scenario tha has been frequently analyzed, even before he Russo- Ukrainian War.1 Theoretically, a reduction of supplies can be compensated for in hree ways. First, Russian imports could be replaced by imports from other sources; second, demand can be reduced and energy can be saved; and hird, infra­ structure bo lenecks can be eliminated, for example hrough more efficien pipeline management. These measures are reflected in he political strategies from 2022, such as in he RePowerEU package.2 1 Cf. for example Hella Engerer e al. “European Natural Gas Supply Secure Despite Political Crises”",

Nevertheless, Russia is cur­ rently still supplying numerous EU Member States, both via Türkiye as well as via LNG and, paradoxically, via Ukraine (Box 1). For example, as of winter 2023–2024, more han 95 percen of Austria’s gas imports are from Russia.3 The ongoing dependency of Central and Eastern EU Member States on Russia is an importan reason ha he EU did no sanction Russian natural gas exports. In each of he firs wo quarters of 2021—before he Russo- Ukrainian War began—the EU purchased over 40 billion cubic meters of natural gas from Russia, which corresponded to over 45 percen of he EU’s otal gas imports. In he same period in 2023, his amoun was reduced o 10.5 billion cubic meters per quarter. Of hat, hree billion cubic meters were delivered via Ukraine and around 2.5 billion cubic meters via Türkiye. Moreover, around five billion cubic meters of Russian LNG are imported each quarter.4 However, he gas ransi agreemen between Russia and Ukraine will end on December 31, 2024. A he same ime, i is unlikely ha he Nord Stream and Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea pipelines will be recommissioned in he near future due to he ongoing war and physical damage o he pipelines as a resul of explosions in September 2022. Overall, his leads to he question of whether Europe would have a sufficien supply withou Russian natural gas via Ukraine and Türkiye and LNG imports. Developmen of European natural gas markets depending on supply and demand This Weekly Repor uses he Global Gas Model (GGM), which has been used in research and policy advice for many years (Box 2), o analyze he medium and long-term European natural gas supply. For Europe, he effects of global climate policy rends in particular are decisive for global natural gas production and demand as well as geopolitical developments related o Russia. Therefore, wo global climate action sce- narios on he demand side are combined with hree scenarios for Russian exports on he supply side. Scenarios for he developmen of EU gas demand and Russian supply limitations The differen climate policy ambitions are depicted in wo exemplary scenarios. In he firs scenario, which could",
      "be considered our reference scenario, global natural gas demand is reduced rapidly until 2050, as would be expected with 3 Bundesministerium für Klimaschutz, Umwelt, Energie, Mobilität, Innovation und Technologie, Österreichs Energie-Infoportal (2024) (in German; available online). 4 Cf. he data in Ben McWilliams e al, European Natural Gas Imports (Bruegel Datasets) ( available online), which has been continuously updated since June 2022. ambitious climate policy (scenario with rapidly declining natural gas demand). In he second scenario, natural gas demand is reduced a a delayed pace until i falls o zero in 2050 (scenario with slowly declining natural gas demand). This would be conceivable if, for example, natural gas firs had o compensate for he missing power generation from closing nuclear power plants. In his scenario, natural gas demand in he EU remains a a constan level until he 2030s. Simultaneously, here is a marked decline in European natu­ ral gas production. Thus, his scenario has he highes impor dependency in he nex years (Figure 1).5 5 Other scenarios are conceivable, such as hose in which a complete natural gas phase-ou is no achieved by 2050. Two scenarios were defined ha do no mee he requirements of he Paris Agreement. In he Moderate Climate Ambition scenario, global natural gas demand de­ clines and here are moderately improved climate action ambitions in Europe. In he No Climate Ambition scenario, in contrast, here is unlimited use of natural gas withou climate action. Both scenarios resul in lower medium-term impor demand in Europe han he scenario with slowly decreasing demand described in his Weekly Report. Cf. he data specifications of hese scenarios (available online).

This is compared o a scenario with a complete stop of Russian imports o Europe (Sanctions Scenario) and o a scenario assuming large volumes of imports from Russia (Pre-War Scenario). The las scenario is somewha differ­ en from he situation before 2022 because i includes he increased diversification efforts of European imports com­ pared o he 2010s. Russian natural gas could be replaced in he entire EU I became clear in 2022 ha Russian natural gas could be largely replaced by a combination of imports from other sources and a decline in demand. However, Central and Eastern European countries are still purchasing Russian pipeline gas and LNG. As he New Normal Scenario shows, i is possible o continue his impor strategy in he shor term, both with rapidly",
      "declining demand (Figure 2, op) as well as delayed declining demand (Figure 3, op). The share of Russian gas would fall o around en o 15 percen of he European natural gas supply in he long run. The model calculations show ha completely foregoing Russian natural gas (Sanctions Scenario) would be possible for he EU and would require demand o decline only slightly. This is made possible as a resul of sufficien available impor capacities and ample natural gas volumes on he global mar­ ke (Figure 2, center).6 In his case, more LNG would be 6 The prices calculated in he model increase only moderately in he EU Member States ( approx. ten percent). However, i mus be noted ha equilibrium prices are calculated, which do no in­ clude factors such as uncertainty and short-term adjustments.

Box 1 The history of natural gas and geopolitics Natural gas has been a significan par of he European energy system since he 1970s. Since hen, geopolitics has played a cen­ tral role in issues such as price se ing and security of supply. To secure he supply of Germany and other European countries, long- term contracts have been concluded with governments, such as one with he Netherlands in he 1970s and one with Norway in he 1980s.1 As natural gas markets became globalized hrough he de­ velopmen of LNG ransport, hese agreements were expanded o other continents. As of 2024, he global LNG marke is dominated by American, Australian, and Qatari suppliers. Natural gas delivered via pipeline from he Sovie Union was par of he Western European energy mix even during he Cold War. However, i has been viewed critically by he USA from he begin­ ning.2 While he USA’s embargo hreats in he 1960s still blocked rapprochement, some Western European countries and he Sovie Union concluded long-term contracts from he early 1970s on­ ward ha established he delivery and financing of pipelines by Germany in exchange for he Sovie natural gas supplies. Up until he 1990s, he Member States of he curren EU obtained Sovie natural gas almos exclusively via Ukraine. Back hen, his pipeline system had a capacity of nearly 150 billion cubic meters per year, more han one hird of he curren natural gas con­ sumption in he EU.3 Following he collapse of he Sovie Union, 1 Anne Neumann, Sophia Rüster, and Christian von Hirschhausen, “Long-Term Contracts in he Natural Gas Industry – Literature Survey and Data on 426 Contracts (1965–2014),” DIW Data Docu­ mentation no. 77 (2015) (available online). 2 For more on his, see O o Wolff von Amerongen, Der Weg nach Osten: Vierzig Jahre Brücken­ bau für die deutsche Wirtschaf (Munich: Droemer Knaur, 1992): 208ff (in German). 3 However, due o a lack of pipeline maintenance and he decommissioning of individual border-crossing points, his capacity has declined in he pas decades. Russia diversified its expor routes, primarily o",
      "avoid geostrategic dependencies on he newly independen Ukraine.4 This diversification began in he 1990s with he construction of the Yamal–Europe pipeline via Belarus and Poland and continued in he late 2000s with he firs Nord Stream projec hrough he Baltic Sea.5 Since 2011, Germany and parts of Western and Eastern Europe have been supplied via he Nord Stream pipeline, which had a capacity of 55 billion cubic meters per year.6 From he outset, Nord Stream 2 also served o bypass Ukraine as a transi country withou being necessary for he energy sector.7 This also became clear in he ransi agreemen concluded between Russia and Ukraine in 2019. This agreemen prescribes he ransi of only 65 billion cubic meters in 2020 and 40 billion cubic meters each year in 2021 hrough 2024. Recently, Russian expor possibilities o Europe were further diver­ sified by opening up he route via Türkiye as well as by building up substantial liquefaction capacities. A he same ime, he sales of pipeline gas were diversified with he construction of he firs pipe­ lines connecting o China. 4 Cf.

Even in a sce­ nario in which natural gas demand in he EU remains con­ sistently high until 2030, a complete supply stop of Russian natural gas o he EU would be possible (Figure 3, center). In he Pre-War Scenario, in which a greater volume of Russian imports becomes available again in he EU, Russia would expor more natural gas o Europe in a scenario with initially stable and high demand (Figure 3, bo om) han in the scenario with rapidly declining demand (Figure 2, bot­ tom). However, due o greater diversification, Russia would no be as dominan as supplier as i was before he war. Norway became he EU’s mos importan natural gas sup­ plier in 2022 and will remain so in he alternative scenarios and in he nex decades. The share of EU imports coming from Norway will depend on he role of Russia, especially in the coming years. In he longer erm, he exten of climate action will determine he volume of Norwegian imports, which is lower in he rapid phase-ou scenario compared o the scenario with a",
      "slow decline in demand. The medium and long-term natural gas strategy is controversial in Norway, as deposits north of he Arctic Circle mus be exploited o maintain he curren annual production capacity of over 100 billion cubic meters. Due o its proximity o he EU and privileged political relations, Norway can also supply more than 50 billion cubic meters per year o he EU in he 2030s and retain an importan role until Europe phases ou natu­ ral gas use completely. Curren LNG impor erminal construction plans are oo large, even with high demand until 2030 LNG became a larger share of European imports han in previous years relatively quickly in 2022 in order o compen­ sate for he decline in Russian natural gas. This was possible because, on he one hand, a significan amoun of unused LNG impor capacity was available along he European coasts. On he other hand, LNG supply and global liquefication capac­ ities have increased since 2016, with he entry of he USA and Russia into he LNG rade being particularly significant. Accordingly, LNG imports play a larger role in he model results han hey did in he 2010s (Figure 4). In he New Normal and Sanctions Scenarios, other pipeline imports, especially from Norway, North Africa, and he Caspian Sea region, can only partially compensate for he marked decline in pipeline imports from Russa. The share of LNG of otal imports increases primarily in he scenario with a slow decline in demand ha assumes contin­ uously high consumption until he beginning of he 2030s with lower EU production. A its peak, up o 167 billion cubic meters of LNG would be imported o he EU in his sce­ nario, which would be nearly 50 percen of otal gas imports. In almos all combined scenarios, however, hese LNG imports could be realized withou requiring he LNG ermi­ nal expansions currently being planned, which shall increase capacity in he EU o well over 200 billion cubic meters per year.7 A small expansion of LNG impor capacities, namely in Croatia and Italy, would be necessary only in he scenario with high demand and a complete end of Russian imports. The existing capacities in continental Northwestern Europe would be used with higher capacity utilization rates han they have been in pas years, especially in he New Normal and Sanctions Scenarios with a low volume of imports and no imports from Russia, respectively. In he scenario where demand declines immediately, he EU would require a mos 127 billion cubic meters of LNG imports if here were no Russian imports. 7 Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, European LNG Tracker (2024) ( available online).

The model calculations show ha these countries could also compensate for a complete end of Russian imports (Figure 5). LNG imports from he USA and Qatar would play a particularly importan role, as would nat­ ural gas delivered via pipelines from Norway and he Caspian Sea region (for example Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan). For some countries, domestic gas production continues o be important, especially for Romania. Europe has an extensive pipeline network which enables importers in countries withou LNG ports o purchase LNG from he world markets. Germany, for example, imported LNG withou its own erminals via harbors in Belgium and the Netherlands. However, he large LNG impor capacities of he Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal, with a otal of over 60 billion cubic meters of impor capacity) are cu off from he res of Europe due o limited pipeline capacities between Spain and France.8 8 The problem of low cross-border capacity between Spain and France has been known for many years, cf. for example Engerer e al., “European Natural Gas Supply Secure Despite Political Crises.” There were brief political efforts o agree on an expansion during he energy crisis in 2022, bu nothing came o fruition.

In he shor erm, he expor possibilities are limited o LNG and the Power of Siberia pipeline running o China. I can be assumed ha pipeline capacities can be expanded in he medium and long erm. Russian gas exports have been increasingly oriented owards Asia for some ime now, regardless of he geopolitical situ­ ation.9 This is he resul of both growing demand in Asia as well as overall demand shrinking in Europe. However, China has a lower willingness o pay han previ­ ous European importers, meaning a decline in Russia’s",
      "reve­ nue can be expected. Russia also obtains low prices (because they are se by he government) with he volumes ha have shifted o he domestic market. Efficien infrastructure utilization is a cost- effective option for improving security of supply In addition o diversifying natural gas imports and reduc­ ing demand, more efficien use of existing natural gas infra­ structure can also contribute o further easing he situa­ tion in Europe. Up until now, his infrastructure has no been used efficiently, especially in cross-border gas rade. In this case, he commercial pipeline capacities are negotiated bilaterally, meaning i may no be possible o use he entire available infrastructure. Also within some Member States, he curren congestion managemen scheme, he entry-exi system, prevents full infrastructure utilization and creates artificial scarcity.10 With efficien use, in contrast, cross-operator optimization would be possible, as has long been he practice in he electricity sector in he USA.11 Inefficien network managemen in the natural gas industry has been criticized since he mar­ ket’s liberalization in Europe in 1998, bu has still no been resolved despite gradual progress.12 9 Franziska Holz, Philipp M. Richter, and Ruud Egging, “A Global Perspective on he Future of Natural Gas: Resources, Trade, and Climate Constraints,” Review of Environmental Economics and Policy 9, no. 1 (2015): 85–106. 10 10 In he entry-exi system, he gas supplier mus purchase network capacity on a piecemeal basis, which can be restricted relatively freely by he individual network operators. 11 See Fred C. Schweppe e al., Spo Pricing of Electricity (Boston, USA: Kluwer, 1988); as well as William W. Hogan, “Contrac Networks for Electric Power Transmission,” Journal of Regulatory Economics 4, no. 3 (1992): 211–242 (available online). 12 For more on his, see Christian von Hirschhausen, “Infrastructure, Regulation, Investmen and Security of Supply: A Case Study of he Restructured US Natural Gas Market,” Utilities Policy 16, no. 1 (2008): 1–10 (available online); as well as Jeff D. Makholm, The Political Economy of Pipelines: A Century of Comparative Institutional Developmen (The University of Chicago Press, 2012). Conclusion: Natural gas phase-ou is the bes instrumen for avoiding future impor dependency Overall, he German and European energy industries sur­ vived he loss of Russian pipeline exports withou major dis­ ruptions. Energy savings efforts, diversifying suppliers, and flexible network managemen have offse he bo lenecks. The wholesale prices of natural gas have declined sharply since September 2022, supply disruptions have no occurred, and he “crisis” in he natural gas industry has been over since a leas spring 2023. However, he EU is still purchasing gas from Russia via pipe­ line and as LNG. The issue of gas sanctions agains Russia is no off he able in view of he ongoing war in Ukraine. Currently, he EU is considering sanctions agains Russian LNG. Thus, he European Commission wants o ban he use of European harbors for he onward shipmen of Russian LNG o hird countries, which is currently happening, for example in Zeebrugge (Belgium). Box 2 Global Gas Model The Global",
      "Gas Model was developed by researchers a he Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) and DIW Berlin and has been regularly updated for over en years.1 The model depicts all relevan actors in he natural gas industry: natural gas producers, natural gas raders, LNG ex­ por erminals (liquefaction), LNG ships, LNG impor erminals (regasification), pipeline operators, storage operators, and a final demand comprised of differen sectors. Costs, capacity assumptions, and assumptions abou he costs of expanding infrastructure capacities are included in he model for each actor and each country. The model distinguishes between 136 regions (nodes) ha are connected o each other via pipeline or LNG ranspor routes. In he model calculations, both he curren impor and ranspor capacities as well as the possibility of expanding pipeline or harbor capacities are considered. Natural gas suppliers can exercise marke pow­ er, especially Russia, he USA, Qatar, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Algeria. The model calculations are performed a five-year steps until 2060. Assumptions mus be made abou future demand and production volumes in all countries ha are needed o parameterize he demand and supply functions. For the results presented in his Weekly Report, he model data were updated and he star year was se o 2020 in order o be able o calculate investments for he firs observation year (2025). Furthermore, an updated and open-source version is now available.2 1 Ruud Egging and Franziska Holz, “Global Gas Model: Model and Data Documentation v3.0 (2019),” DIW Data Documentation no. 100 (2019) (available online). 2 The model code and data are available online. 156 DIW Weekly Repor 21/2024 NATURAL GAS SUPPLY Model calculations show ha he EU can maintain a suffi­ cien supply of natural gas withou Russian imports even if demand remains a oday’s level. In he shor erm, addi­ tional deliveries from Norway and LNG imports a existing impor erminals are contributing o diversification. In he medium and long erm, he European energy sector is head­ ing o a natural gas phase-out. The rapid switch o renew­ able energy sources can significantly contribute o reduc­ ing impor dependencies and, hus, he supposed risk of some European countries o be blackmailed. Hence, secu­ rity of supply is no reason for he EU o no sanction Russian gas imports. European natural gas infrastructure, such as pipelines, LNG terminals, and compressor stations, has been significantly expanded since he 2005–2006 Russia–Ukraine gas dispute and only requires minor expansion, even with moderate cli­ mate action and continued high natural gas demand. In par­ ticular, he currently planned expansion of European LNG capacities seems o be oo extensive. Efficien use of exist­ ing pipeline capacities, in contrast, strengthens security of supply and keeps costs low.

From he consumer’s poin of view, divestitures should ake place in favor of manufacturers with less bargain­ ing power. In concentrated markets, merger control is an importan tool for Competition Authorities. This is because i can preven further reductions in competition and because i is allowed o actively intervene in he market. This also applies o he food sector, where concentration along he supply chain has increased significantly in recen years. Retail has seen significan concentration, driven by waves of mergers,1 he formation of buying alliances,2 and the proliferation of private labels.3 Similarly, here has been an increase in concentration within he manufacturing sec­ tor.4 This concentration is driven in par by mergers and acquisitions ha have allowed manufacturers o increase their marke power. As a result, mos markets along he food supply chain end o be characterized by an oligopolis­ tic marke structure, in which a few firms with large marke shares operate a each level of he supply chain. Changes in competition and, herefore, marke power a one level of he supply chain are likely o affec all levels. For instance, in he case of an upstream merger, a reduction in the number of food manufacturers may lead o an increase in heir marke power, which could resul in higher whole­ sale prices paid by he retailers. The exten o which his increased upstream marke power is passed on o final con­ sumers depends on he bargaining power of he downstream firms. Therefore, in vertically related markets, Competition Authorities mus analyze he entire vertical marke struc­ ture in order o accurately assess he degree of competition along he value chain and he likely impac ha changes in competition may have on food-consumer prices. This is he case, for example, in he even of a merger and he imple­ mentation of remedies o address competition concerns. 1 Bha acharya Vivek, e al., “Merger effects and antitrus enforcement: Evidence from us retail,” NBER Working Paper 31123 (2023): 1–75 (available online). 2 Ma hew Grennan, “Price discrimination and bargaining: Empirical evidence from medical devices,” American Economic Review 103, no. 1 (2013): 145–177 (available online). 3 Claire Chambolle and Morgane Guignard, “Buyer Power and he Effec of Vertical Integration on Innovation,” DIW Berlin Discussion Paper no. 2071 (2024): 1–36 (available online). 4 Jan De Loecker, e al., “The rise of marke power and he macroeconomic implications,” The Quarterly Journal of Economics 135, no. 2 (2020): 561–644 (available online). 161 DIW Weekly Repor 22+23/2024 MERGER CONTROL AND BARGAINING POWER Figure Brand portfolio of he merger and he buyer before and after he merger with divestiture Source: Authors’ depiction. © DIW Berlin 2024 Carte Noire was divested and is now a par of Lavazza.

CR4 corresponds o he highes four-firm concentration ratios often referred o as CR4. A value above 50 percen suggests significan marke control by hese firms, indicating high concentration and potentially reduced competition. 7 Authors’ calculation based on Kantar Worldpanel data. In such concentrated markets, wholesale prices are usually se hrough negotiations between manufacturers and retail­ ers. A suitable economic model for investigating hese nego­ tiations and he effects of mergers on he manufacturers is the Nash bargaining model (Box 2).8 Bargaining power plays a decisive role in he model: he greater a manufacturer's bar­ gaining power vis-à-vis a retailer, he higher he wholesale prices i can impose and he higher consumer prices will be. Conversely, if he bargaining power lies with he retailer, he wholesale and consumer prices will be relatively low. French retailers have a lo of bargaining power The firs step of our analysis is o estimate he bargain­ ing power of he manufacturers and retailers along he coffee value chain. Specifically, we examine purchases from he seven leading retailers: Carrefour, Leclerc, ITM, Auchan, Système U, Casino, and an aggregate of discount­ ers. Additionally, our focus extends o he brands produced by he eigh larges manufacturers: DEMB, Lavazza, Legal, Malongo, Mondelez, Nestlé, Segafredo, and an aggregate of private labels. This approach encompasses all manufactur­ ers mentioned by he Competition Authority and cited in the merger case. The data used for he analysis is Kantar Worldpanel on consumer coffee purchases in France from 2013 o 2017. I aims o implemen a retrospective analysis of he DEMB/Mondelēz merger case. The results indicate ha manufacturers face powerful retail­ ers in he French coffee marke (Figure 1). The merged entity has he weakes bargaining power vis-à-vis retailers compared to other manufacturers. The buyer of he divested brand also 8 Henrick Horn and Asher Wolinsky, “Bilateral monopolies and incentives for merger,” The RAND Journal of Economics 19, no. 3 (1988): 408–419 (available online). Box 2 Nash barganing model The model assumes ha bilateral contracts between manu­ facturers and retailers lead o gains from rade. These gains from rade are defined as he difference between he benefits of reaching an agreemen and hose ha would have been obtained if he agreemen failed. When an agreemen fails, a given manufacturer can sell its other products. The larger its portfolio of products, he less he manufacturer gains from an agreemen with a given retailer. Thus, a larger produc port­ folio leads o a be er bargaining position vis-à-vis retailers. Gains from rade are spli between he manufacturers and retailers. A manufacturer",
      "obtaining a higher share of he gains created from rade is said o have more bargaining power, which is represented by he so-called bargaining weights. Here we estimate he bargaining weigh of each side in simu­ lations, where his bargaining power is estimated, with values ranging from zero (no bargaining power) o one (full bargaining power).

Our estimates also allow for quantifying he cos savings associated with he merger and divestiture. The results sug­ ges ha he otal costs associated with he other products of he buyer of he divested brand, Lavazza, decreased after the divestiture. Indeed, he divestiture included Mondelez's manufacturing facility situated in he south of France, where Lavazza combined all its production lines for he Carte Noire brand. The acquisition of he French manufacturing facil­ ity enabled Lavazza o produce its own brand a he French facility, providing i easier access o he French marke and achieving more efficien production. Withou Divestiture, he Merger would have led to higher Consumer Prices To measure he impac of he merger and divestiture on final prices, i is necessary o determine wha prices would have been in he absence of he merger and divestiture. However, our datase only allows us o observe actual prices after he merger and divestiture occurred. The model can be used o simulate counterfactual prices o evaluate he changes in prices resulting from he merger and he divestiture, while considering he bargaining power within he vertical rela­ tionships existing in he French coffee market. This involves simulating wo scenarios: Scenario 1: The merger does no occur. Scenario 2: The merger occurs withou divestiture. The comparison between he simulated prices of Scenario 1 and he observed prices measures he price effec of he merger and he divestiture. The comparison between he simulated prices of Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 measures he price effec of he merger withou divestiture. Furthermore, the model enables us o estimate changes in consumer sur­ plus in response o counterfactual prices. Figure 2 shows he percentage changes in prices resulting from he merger with and withou he divestiture. The results indicate hat, in he absence of divestiture, he merger would have led o price increases of around 5 percent, which corre­ sponds o an increase of around 1.14 euros per kilogram. The price changes resulting from he merger with he divestiture imposed by he European Commission are lower, resulting instead in a price increase of approximately wo percent, or an increase of approximately 0.46 euros per kilogram. In addi­ tion, he divestiture",
      "resulted in some cos efficiencies for he buyer, which led o a price decrease of approximately 1.72 per­ cent, or approximately 0.22 euros per kilogram (Figure 2). 9 Due o confidentiality restrictions, specific manufacturer names canno be directly associated with prices or marke shares. Columns (i) and (ii) of he Table show he variation in con­ sumer surplus with and withou he divestiture.10 Had he European Commission approved he merger withou rem­ edies, he reduction in consumer surplus would have been more pronounced han with remedies, decreasing consumer surplus by abou 483,000 euros for sampled consumers. The merger cleared with divestiture led o an overall reduc­ tion in consumer surplus of abou 132,000 euros for sam­ pled consumers. The results indicate ha although he merger reduced con­ sumer surplus, his reduction is mitigated by he divesti­ ture. This supports he European Commission's decision to require divestiture o mitigate he anticompetitive effects of he merger. Yet, he divestiture failed both o fully pre­ ven negative consumer effects and o restore competition. Considering Bargaining Power in Vertically related Markets is importan when requiring divestiture We now examine he importance of quantifying bargaining power when evaluating potential buyers of divested brands in order o effectively assess he impac of divestiture on con­ sumer prices. We provide recommendations o Competition Authorities on how o selec he buyer of he divested brand in vertical markets. 10 Discrete choice models are used o calculate he change in consumer surplus; Kenneth Train, “Discrete Choice Methods with Simulation,” Second Edition. (2009): Cambridge University Press. Figure 2 Predicted price effects of he merger and he divestiture Change in prices in percent Source: Authors’ calculations. © DIW Berlin 2024 Withou he divestiture, he observed price increase for he merged entity’s brands would be higher. 164 DIW Weekly Repor 22+23/2024 MERGER CONTROL AND BARGAINING POWER Another importan factor causing a change in competition a one level of he food supply chain is mergers between compa­ nies. Mergers mus be approved by Competition Authorities. A condition of merger approval is often he implementation of a divestiture. In his report, we discuss he effectiveness of divestiture as a merger remedy. We argue ha i may be less effective in vertically related industries where bargaining is a key feature of he market. If Competition Authorities ignore he inher­ en imbalance in bargaining power between manufacturers and retailers when enforcing upstream divestiture, hey are likely o implemen a policy ha does no restore competi­ tion in he market. The main reason is ha here is no a direc relationship between marke share and bargaining power. The bargain­ ing literature identifies several potential determinants of bargaining power. For example, higher bargaining power may resul from superior brand assortment, firms' willing­ ness o bargain patiently, or enhanced bargaining skills. Antitrus authorities canno infer hese bargaining power values from observed marke shares alone, as we show ha a small buyer can have large bargaining power and reduce con­ sumer surplus more han a large buyer with smaller bargain­",
      "ing power. Therefore, an accurate estimation of hese bar­ gaining weights is crucial for decisions regarding he selec­ tion of he buyer for he divested brand. This has importan implications for competition policy in Europe, bu also spe­ cifically in Germany. Germany recently introduced a new amendmen o the German Competition Act, known as he 11th GWB Amendment, ha could increase he number of divesti­ tures in certain markets. Indeed, an importan aspec of this amendmen is he introduction of a new marke inves­ tigation ool ha allows for policy intervention in markets where here are significan and lasting distortion of com­ petition withou a proven breach of competition law.11 This repor argues ha bargaining power is a key factor ha mus be aken into consideration. 11 For more details, see Tabea Bauermeister, “New Provisions in German Competition Law: New Competition Tool, Provisions Accompanying he DMA and a Presumption of Benefits,” Kluwer Competition Law Blog, 2023. (available online). Precisely, we study an alternative scenario in which he divested brand is ransferred o a differen manufacturer. This hypothetical scenario is interesting because he alterna­ tive manufacturer has a smaller marke share (1.57 percen on average compared o 1.83 percen for he actual buyer) bu higher bargaining power han he actual buyer (0.41 for he rival manufacturer compared o 0.27 for he actual buyer). Because of he smaller marke share i would be a more acceptable alternative for approval by he Competition Authorities, compared o he actual buyer, when ignoring the bargaining power. By contrast, we find ha divesting o a small buyer – in erms of marke shares – migh no be he bes policy in vertically related industries. Indeed, our results sugges ha divesting a brand o a small buyer with significan bargaining power is unlikely o mitigate he anti-competitive effects of he merger. If he divested brand is bough by he alternative buyer (col­ umn (iii)), he negative impac on consumer surplus becomes more pronounced with an overall decrease in consumer sur­ plus of abou 149,000 euros for sampled consumers. More broadly, he results indicate ha he actual divestiture leads o he smalles change in consumer surplus. Conclusion: Bargaining Power mus be understood when evaluating mergers The food supply chain is a key driver of he European econ­ omy. The degree of competition a each level of he supply chain determines he exten o which a change in compe­ tition a one level of he supply chain will affec all levels.

A sharp rise in construction investment, albei more of a flash in he pan as a resul of mild winter weather, along with strong goods exports helped he economy onto its recov­ ery path and masked he disappointing developmen of private consumption, which sank unexpectedly. However, consumer sentimen has since brightened considerably: Following he recen special payments, employees in many sectors are now earning more on a permanen basis due to pay raises, which increases income security. In conjunc­ tion with he inflation rate now being stable a below he three-percen hreshold, real wages are rising significantly. Added o his is he urnaround in interes rates initiated by he European Central Bank, which is making saving less a ractive and loans more affordable. The UEFA European Men’s Football Championship, which is being held in Ger­ many his year, is also likely o boos consumption, albei slightly. In addition o private consumption, foreign rade will prove to be he second mainstay of he German economy in he forecas period. On he one hand, imports are increasing as he domestic economy becomes stronger. On he other hand, he German expor industry will also experience a significan boost, as industrial production is likely o pick up worldwide. Due o he high share of intermediate products and investmen goods, exports “made in Germany” are particularly dependen on he global industry’s economic situation. In Germany, oo, industrial companies will begin investing more in heir capacities from 2025 a he latest. Construction investmen will hen also rise again. Overall, he outlook is somewha more positive han i was in he spring: Instead of stagnating, DIW Berlin now expects the German economy o grow by 0.3 percen in 2024 and by 1.3 percen in 2025. One risk factor for he forecas is ha he full exten of he damage from he flooding in southern Germany is still unclear. In some places, pro­ duction capacities could remain impaired for longer han expected. A he same ime, i is also conceivable ha repair and reconstruction work could increase economic output. Overall, however, he effects in one way or he other are likely o remain manageable. In addition, he ug-of-war over he nex federal budge could once again become a factor contributing o uncertainty, possibly even more so than was already o be expected after he results of he EU elections in Germany. The global economy will also gain some momentum over the forecas period. The euro area is finally overcoming its weak phase for good and international rade is picking up speed. The interes rate urnaround in he major advanced economies will likely have a positive effec on residential construction and corporate investments from he second half of 2024. Overall, he global economy is expected o",
      "grow by 3.7 percen in 2024 and by 3.6 percen in 2025. 169 DIW Weekly Repor 24+25+26/2024 GLOBAL ECONOMY The global economy developed be er han expected in he firs quarter of 2024 in particular due o he recovery of domestic demand in mos advanced economies. Among the emerging economies, China performed surprisingly well in erms of high exports and strong industrial output. In Europe, real wage increases have finally arrived in he pockets of consumers and are boosting private consumption. Quarter-on-quarter he economy expanded by 0.3 and 0.6 per­ cen in he euro area and he United Kingdom, respectively. Economic growth in he United States was a 0.3 percen and continues o be carried by consumer spending. In contrast, inflation is weighing strongly on domestic demand in Japan, where GDP shrunk by 0.5 percen in he firs quarter of 2024. Of he emerging economies, he Indian and Chinese econ­ omies experienced he mos growth. The Chinese economy expanded by 1.6 percent, more han in he previous quarter; this was driven primarily by industrial outpu and exports, while domestic demand continued o develop weakly. Overall, the global economy expanded by 1.0 percen in he firs quar­ ter of 2024, similar o he fourth quarter of 2023 (Figure 1). The global economy should continue its recovery into he curren second quarter of 2024. The upswing in he advanced economies will receive a bi more momentum, especially due to he euro area economy, where falling inflation rates com­ bined with rising nominal wages are leading o rising real wages. This should boos he purchasing power of consum­ ers as well as domestic demand. The upswing in he United Kingdom is also likely o continue; he favorable outlook for services points o a further increase in consumption. The US economy, in contrast, is expected o expand only mod­ erately, as private households’ remaining excess savings are running out, cooling private consumption. In Japan, high inflation is continuing o weigh on economic growth. The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Indices have been recovering in mos advanced economies since he beginning of 2024. The May values for Japan, he United Kingdom, and the United States are consistently over he hreshold expan­ sion of 50. The value for he euro area remained under 50, bu experienced a strong increase from 45.7 in April o 47.3 in May. Thus, industrial outpu is likely o gradually pick up speed. The emerging economies are expected o cool down in he second quarter following a strong firs quarter. While eco­ nomic developmen in China and India continues o suppor growth, other countries such as Brazil and Mexico are experi­ encing weak growth due o dampened domestic demand. In contrast, here are signs of a recovery in economic momen­ tum in China, mainly due o more expansive monetary and fiscal policies. Moreover, he recovery of he global econ­ omy is likely o boos Chinese exports. Continued dynamic growth is expected for he Indian economy in he second quarter hanks o solid domestic demand.",
      "International rade recovered by 0.3 percen in he firs quar­ ter of 2024, following a decline of 1.9 percen in 2023. Weak demand from advanced economies and ongoing geopolitical turmoil weighed on international rade in 2023. Nevertheless, some rade barriers have partly been dissolved since he beginning of he year: For example, circumventing blockaded trade routes from Asia o Europe by means of an alternative African route is now factored into supply chains and produc­ tion. This and he gradual recovery of he global economy are likely o lead o international rade picking up somewha in 2024, albei less strongly han before he pandemic. One importan reason for his is ha rade policy conflicts, espe­ cially between Western countries and China, will continue to have a dampening effect. The punitive ariffs imposed by the US governmen on Chinese electric vehicles and sem­ iconductors in May 2024 emphasize he fac ha he situa­ tion is no expected o ease anytime soon. Monetary policy in many advanced economies remained restrictive a he beginning of 2024 and interes rates were still high.

I is expected ha other central banks will begin lowering heir interes rates in he summer (Box). In he euro area, his urnaround happened on June 6th, sooner han in he United States and he United Kingdom due o rapidly falling inflation rates. Commodity prices are also no longer likely o provide any price-driving impetus. Japan is a special case, as its inflation is still well above he Bank of Japan’s wo-percen arge as of April 2024 a 2.5 per­ cent, which is unusually high for he country. Monetary policy has once again become somewha less restrictive in many emerging economies. There have already been regular key interes rate cuts in Brazil since he end of 2023 due o declining inflation rates and low economic growth, while Mexico decreased its key interes rates in March 2024. In February 2024, he People’s Bank of China also adopted a more expansive course by lowering its mini­ mum reserves o suppor he struggling economy and com­ ba deflationary rends. In India, he key interes rate will likely no be lowered until he hird quarter because food Box Assumptions and framework conditions The forecas is based on he following assumptions abou he further developmen of key interes rates, exchange rates, and commodity prices (Table). These assumptions were made based on previous development, futures markets prices, and he closing prices on he date of his forecas (14. May 2024). The European Central",
      "Bank (ECB) firs decreased interes rates in June, as was assumed in he spring forecast. After a year of stable interes rates, i has now initiated a urnaround; further interes rate cuts will follow. We assume five subsequen cuts over he forecasting horizon. In detail, we assume a cu of 35 basis points a he September 2024 meeting, and subsequen cuts every quarter of respectively 25 basis points.1 Taken ogether, his leads to a decline of 85 basis points in 2024 and of 75 basis points in 2025. The ECB has hus initiated an interes rate cu before he US Federal Reserve. The Fed and he Bank of England will presum­ ably no lower interes rates until he hird quarter of 2024.

The euro has recently depreciated agains he US dollar due o he interes rate differential. For he forecas period, i is assumed ha the exchange rate of EUR o USD will remain a 1,08 USD per EUR, the level reached a he end of he data period on June 6. Uncertainties abou he gas supply in he coming year resulted in sligh increases in he wholesale price for gas (TTF) recently. However, well-filled gas storage facilities should preven a severe supply shortage. According o futures, he average gas price should be around 30.90 and 35.50 euros per megawa hours in 2024 and 2025, respectively. According o raded futures, he price for Bren oil should increase slightly in he coming months before declining again a he star of 2025 until he end of he forecas period. In 2024, he average price is likely o be 83 USD per barrel before i declines o an average of 78 USD per barrel in 2025. This forecas is also based on political assumptions: We assume tha no further escalations will occur, bu also ha none of he cur­ ren geopolitical crises, such as he Israeli-Hamas war, he Russo- Ukrainian War, and conflic between China and Taiwan, will end.

As he developmen in he euro area as well as in China was be er han expected in he firs half of 2024, DIW Berlin is increasing its forecas for he entire year by 0.2 percentage points. In 2025, he global economy is likely o increase by 3.6 percent, unchanged from he spring forecast. This forecas is based on several uncertainty factors. On the one hand, geopolitical risks remain quite high. The cri­ ses relating o he ongoing Israel-Hamas War could spread throughou he region; here is also no end o he Russo- Ukrainian War in sight. There are also simmering geopo­ litical conflicts in Asia concerning he Korean peninsula or Taiwan, for example. A possible intensification of hese geo­ political conflicts harbors many risks for he global economy, from emporarily higher energy and resource prices o major trade distortions and real economic losses.

However, he overall increase was pri­ marily carried by services; both he consumer-related (around 0.1 percentage points) as well as public (around 0.2 percent­ age points) service sectors experienced a strong expansion. In he curren second quarter, he German economy is likely to increase again by 0.2 percen (Table 2). Private consumption in particular should improve on a sustained basis.

The strong growth in real wages is a relief o low-income households in particular, The German economy is slowly exiting its slump, starting ou 2024 with momentum following weak performance in 2023.3 Economic outpu increased by 0.2 percen in he firs quar­ ter of 2024, more han previously expected (Figure 2).4 The robus growth rate in he firs quarter was due in particular to a surprisingly strong increase in construction investmen as a resul of mild winter weather. In addition, goods exports rose unexpectedly sharply, resulting in a positive rade bal­ ance. Meanwhile, private consumption continued o decline despite falling inflation rates and rising disposable incomes. High interes rates and he German government’s polit­ ical indecisiveness seemed o have dampened consumer sentimen a he beginning of 2024. Even strong growth in real wages seemingly could no boos consumer confidence enough a he beginning of he year o preven a decline in private consumption. The signs for a recovery in private con­ sumption were here a he beginning of 2024: Employmen increased and nominal wages rose significantly, for example in he energy industry and in he public sector a he state level. Together with further declining consumer price infla­ tion, which has been consistently below he hree-percen threshold, real wages rose noticeably. The decline in infla­ tion is primarily due o lower food inflation and lower energy goods prices. Meanwhile, core inflation, which excludes food­ stuffs and energy, rose more strongly in he firs quarter, which was likely largely due o rising prices for services. Goods exports increased markedly, especially he expor of chemical and pharmaceutical products. Chemical products often serve as he intermediate inputs in further production processes. After heir marked declined due o high energy prices, heir recen increase migh poin o a gradual recov­ ery of global industrial production. German goods imports also increased strongly. However, as imports grew less over­ all han exports, here was a positive rade balance in he firs quarter. Private and public investments also supported eco­ nomic output. The main reason for his was he mild weather, which boosted production in he construction industry and led o a significan increase in construction investment, par­ ticularly in residential construction. In contrast, equipmen investmen declined slightly. Gross value added rose somewha more strongly in he firs quarter a 0.3 percen han GDP. Production in he manu­ facturing industry rose slightly.

Household surveys also indicate a lower propensity o save and a greater willingness o consume. The UEFA European Men’s Football Championship, which is aking place in Germany in early summer, will provide additional momentum for private con­ sumption in he second and hird quarters. The global economy is boosting foreign demand. German foreign rade is likely o benefi in particular from he upturn experienced by importan euro area rade partners. Imports are likely o increase a a similar rate o exports, meaning ha the overall contribution of foreign rade o GDP in he sec­ ond quarter will probably be lower han in he firs quarter. Following he strong star o he year, investments, however, are unlikely o provide any growth stimuli in he curren sec­ ond quarter. A negative countermove o he strong increase in he firs quarter is expected in construction investment, mainly due o a decline in residential construction, where the situation remains extremely ense. Equipmen invest­ men is also likely o fall again slightly in ligh of he still fragile economic situation. Industry is also likely o recover rather slowly. Companies are continuing o view heir situation cautiously. The manu­ facturing industry has been recording fewer and fewer new orders since 2022 and business expectations are improving only slowly. The Global Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index has climbed over he expansion hreshold of 50 in he second quarter of 2024, he firs ime since summer 2023. However, his is primarily due o he services sector, where sentimen has recently brightened considerably; he recovery in private consumption and he positive momentum from the UEFA European Men’s Football Championship should ensure a rapid upturn.

The flooding in southern Germany will however likely no significantly disrup production. The recovery of he German economy is projected o gain significan momentum over he further course of he fore­ cast. Private consumption will be he main driver and remain supported by continued positive wage development, rising employment, and declining unemployment.

Reconstruction and repair work following he flooding in southern Germany should no substantially alter his picture. In addition o monetary policy, which is only gradually becoming less restrictive, fiscal policy also displays a restric­ tive orientation: A large number of fiscal policy measures tha were introduced in response o he energy price crisis (above all he electricity and gas price brakes, he stabiliza­ tion of ransmission grid fees, and aid for hospitals and care facilities) have already ended or will end in 2024. In",
      "2025, restrictive stimuli such as he end of he ax-free inflation compensation premium are also likely o outweigh expan­ sionary stimuli from he Wachstumschancengesetz (Growth Opportunities Act) and he special fund for he Bundeswehr. In line with his, governmen deficits are expected o decrease slightly, falling from 2.4 percen in relation o GDP in 2023 to 1.9 percen in 2024 and further o 1.3 percen in 2025. All in all, price-adjusted GDP will likely rise slightly by 0.3 percen in 2024 (Table 3). Growth is projected o be 1.3 percen in 2025. Thus, DIW Berlin is increasing its fore­ cas for 2024 by 0.3 percentage points and for 2025 by 0.1 per­ centage points. The main factors for he improved forecasts are he unexpectedly strong firs quarter of 2024 as well as slightly stronger momentum over he course of he year, which should benefi from he fac ha he global economy and, in particular, importan rading partners will recover somewha more quickly. Potential GDP will likely develop weakly until he end of 2028, primarily due o he negative developmen of labor volume. In ligh of he moderate expansion in 2024, he outpu gap in 2024 is likely o grow somewha larger and amoun o an annual average of -1.6 percen of potential GDP. In 2025, he outpu gap is expected o fall o -0.6, and by 2028 i should close completely. Following he significan rise of 5.9 percen in consumer prices las year, inflation is expected o average 2.3 percen in 2024 and 2.0 percen in 2025. Thus, DIW Berlin’s infla­ tion forecas remains unchanged compared o he spring. In ligh of he higher price increases for services, he core rate is likely o average 2.7 percen in 2024 and fall o 2.0 percen in 2025 as wage growth slows. In addition o he global risks, here are also domestic uncer­ tainties for he German economy, such as he recen flood­ ing in he southern par of he country and he associated damage. The consequences of he flooding in Bavaria and Baden-Wür emberg could be much greater han assumed in his forecast. For example, i is possible ha production capacity is disrupted more han initially expected, with he corresponding consequences for industrial output. This is a downside risk for he forecast. However, an upside risk is also conceivable: If damage o residential buildings and public infrastructure is greater han expected, he resulting reconstruction work could boos economic output, espe­ cially from 2025. Another domestic risk for he German economy is he unclear economic policy framework, in particular he upcom­ ing budge for 2025. If a budge agreemen is significantly delayed, his could make private households and companies uneasy and hus lead o a reluctance o consume and invest.

Nearly one hird of greenhouse gas emissions in Germany are caused by private household consumption. Using Socio-­ Economic Panel (SOEP) data, his Weekly Repor calculates the amoun of CO2 equivalents emi ed by households due o residential energy use, nutrition, and ranspor in Germany. Consumption in hese hree areas alone results in average emissions ha exceed he emissions budge argeted for pri­ vate individuals more han wofold, with ranspor and residen­ tial energy-related emissions accounting for he larges share of emissions. Emissions increase as income increases, espe­ cially in he area of ransport, with air ravel as he main driver. Mea consumption is he main contributor o nutrition-related emissions, and household size and building ype contribute the mos o residential energy-related emissions. By identify­ ing he mos significan driver of emissions in each of he hree areas, argeted political instruments can be identified, such as simplifying housing swaps and he energy-efficien renovation of residential buildings, banning short-haul flights, and intro­ ducing an animal welfare levy. Human emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon diox­ ide (CO2), nitrous oxide, and methane are he main driver of climate change.1 According o he Federal Environmen Agency (Umweltbundesamt, UBA), around 673 million ons of greenhouse gases were emi ed in Germany in 2023, en percen less han in 2022.2 However, he Federal Climate Change Ac stipulates ha emissions mus be reduced by a leas 65 percen compared o 1990 levels by 2030. However, as of 2022, only 40 percen of his reduction had been achieved.3 To reduce greenhouse gas emissions more effectively, i is importan o understand heir primary driver. Policymakers should consider both he reduction potential in industry as well as in private households: After all, around one hird of emissions in Germany can be a ributed o private house­ hold consumption.4 This Weekly Repor calculates and ana­ lyzes he average per capita residential energy consump­ tion (housing), nutrition, and ransport-related emissions in Germany using individual and household information. The analyses are based on unpublished preliminary data from he 2023 Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) survey.5 We calculate per capita residential energy, nutrition, and rans­ port-related carbon footprint6 of private households based on respondents’ information on heir consumption behav­ ior (Box).

Greenhouse gas emissions of private households exceed climate hresholds wofold According o he SOEP survey data, annual per capita emis­ sions in he hree areas (residential energy consumption, nutrition, and ransport) are around 6.5 tons of CO2 equiv­ alents (tCO2e). Each person in Germany emits an annual average of 0.7 tCO2e hrough he use of electricity in heir home (Figure 1). A further 2.2 tCO2e are due o heating and ho water preparation. Nutrition has an average impac of 1.6 tCO2e, while 2.0 tCO2e can be a ributed o ransport. Calculations using SOEP data are hus very close o he UBA’s calculations, which are calculated using a differen methodol­ ogy.7 The values in both calculations are significantly higher than he one o hree ons ha are—depending on he spe­ cific calculation—climate-compatible according o climate experts and he UBA.8 Greenhouse gas emissions increase with income Our calculations confirm ha households’ carbon footprin increases as equivalized income rises,9 primarily due o more transport-related emissions (Figure 2). In erms of nutrition and heating, higher-income households end o have slightly lower per capita emissions.

On aver­ age, 2.9 tons of residential energy-related CO2e are emi ed per person per year.

A four-person house­ hold generates an average of 1.5 tCO2e per person and year, whereas a single-person",
      "household generates jus under 4.0 tCO2e per year (Figure 3). Using a linear regression model, we investigate he correla­ tion between various household characteristics and residen­ tial energy-related emissions per person (Table). The decisive factor is herefore he number of people in he household. In addition, he living space available per person has a signifi­ cant, albei smaller, influence on emissions: For each addi­ tional square meter of space, emissions per person rise by 0.022 tCO2e per year. These wo factors alone explain nearly half of he observed differences in residential energy-related emissions per capita. In contrast, he income available per person has no significan effec when he factors of people and space per person are aken into account. The ype and age of residential buildings also plays a role: People living in multiple-family residential buildings with more han four housing units create around half a on fewer emissions per person han people living in detached single or wo-family homes or farming infrastructure (Figure 4). In addition, he carbon footprin of people living in newer buildings is lower.10 Calculations also show ha he use of solar energy decreases he per capita carbon footprin in a household by around 0.7 tCO2e on average.

Box Data and methodology The carbon footprin of households in Germany due o residential energy consumption, nutrition, and ranspor are calculated using preliminary data from 2023 from he Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). As no weighting factors are currently available for 2023, preliminary weights from he 2022 survey are used, which ake into accoun the households los since he las published survey in 2021. People who firs participated in he survey in 2023 are hus no included. Furthermore, all refugee samples are no aken into account. Due o these restrictions, he sample is reduced o 7,304 respondents. The calculations are based on individual and household informa­ tion aken from household and personal surveys. A similar ap­ proach is followed in each of he hree areas analyzed: Information provided by respondents on how much hey spend on and how much hey consume of goods whose production results in green­ house gases emissions is converted into CO2 equivalents using he corresponding emission factors per uni of consumption. Emission factors from official sources are used, as he value chains in he individual countries differ and he use of national sources is hus the mos suitable and exac for calculating emissions.1 Emissions from specific areas were calculated as follows: Emissions caused by energy consumption in private households are",

Transpor emissions were calculated using data on car ownership, the ype of fuel used, ranspor expenditure, and he frequency of long and short-haul rips via bus, rain, ram, and airplane. Nutrition emissions were calculated using he information provided by re­ spondents on gender, age, weight, and frequency of mea and fish consumption. Missing information on he ype of heating is imputed logically, meaning i is assumed ha a household uses he same ype of heating as hey did in he previous survey as long as hey have no moved. Missing information on housing expenditure or con­ sumption are no imputed. When calculating emissions relating o nutrition, we assume ha he average die profile of he adults in the household applies for he children as well. In he area of rans­ port, he op and bo om one percen are replaced by percentile boundaries.2 For each of he hree areas, he analyses include all households for which he area-specific information was available. This means he number of cases vary between he individual areas. Data cleaning ook place in several phases of he area-specific emission calculations. In a similar way, we confirmed ha all outliers for each individual area are aken into account. These processes can lead o less pronounced differences in emissions by income. 2 To calculate he percentiles, a data se sorted by size is divided into 100 equal parts. Outliers with values larger han he 99th percentile of he sample and smaller han he bo om firs percen­ tile are replaced with limi values. 183 DIW Weekly Repor 27/2024 CARBON FOOTPRINT farming and animal feed production, plant-based foods have a significantly lower carbon footprint. Therefore, he fre­ quency of animal produc consumption is an importan fac­ tor in individual nutrition-related emissions.

On average, he per capita ransport-related emissions are around 2.0 tCO2e per year, abou half of which come from car rips. The greates share of ransport-related emissions is due o flights. Emissions from car rips average 1.0 tCO2e per capita. An average round-trip fligh within Germany causes 0.24 tCO2e; for he same amount, a person could travel 8,000 kilometers by rain. According o he UBA, a domestic or European round-trip fligh emits 0.2 or 0.5 tCO2e, respectively, while an intercon­ tinental round-trip fligh emits 4.7 tCO2e.18 Therefore, here are major differences in ransport-related emissions per person depending on if and where hey fly. While each per­ son in Germany only flies once a year on average, frequen fliers fly en or more imes per year. People who do no fly a all have a ransport-related carbon footprin of around 1.0 tCO2e (Figure 6), while people who ake flights within Europe emi around 2.3 tCO2e per year according o he cal­ culations. For people who have aken one or more intercon­ tinental round-trip flights, heir ransport-related emissions are 9.3 tCO2e on average.

A 4.1 tCO2e, flight-related emissions in he highes income decile are around en imes higher han in he lowes income decile a 0.4 tCO2e.

Around one in en respondents reports to eating mea products several imes a day. Per capita (including children), he average nutrition-related emissions in Germany are 1.6 tCO2e. A vegetarian die results in an average of only 1.2 tCO2e per year (Figure 5).

While he income-related differ­ ences are small and higher income groups end o have lower per capita emissions in he areas of residential energy con­ sumption and nutrition, people from higher-income house­ holds cause significantly more emissions han people from lower-income households in he area of ransport. To achieve he goal of carbon neutrality by 2045 as laid ou in the Federal Climate Change Act, massive individual as well as political efforts are required: Policymakers mus imple­ men and suppor measures ha increase energy efficiency in residential energy consumption, promote environmental­ ly-friendly eating habits, and expand sustainable ranspor options while reducing he emissions-intensive options.

As a classification system, hese axonomies serve to offer ransparency and guidance as o how capital flows can be shifted o sustainable and",
      "environmentally-friendly activities. In his Weekly Report, we analyze 26 sustainable taxonomies from countries and regions around he world using five criteria. Our study shows ha although many ax- onomies follow a holistic sustainability approach, mandatory criteria have often ye o be developed. The share of a country or region’s emissions ha is covered by he axonomy varies considerably, as he axonomies follow differen approaches for determining he activities ha are aligned with hem. Tax- onomies often only apply o a limited group of marke partici- pants and are rarely linked o mandatory reporting obligations. The results emphasize ha be er coordination between he existing axonomies worldwide is needed and ha he criteria and hresholds for selecting activities in alignmen with axon- omies should be in accordance with he Paris Agreement. This way, axonomies can develop heir full potential in guiding he transition. The EU aims o become climate neutral by 2050 as announced in he 2019 Green Deal.1 A classification system for sustaina- ble economic activities, known as he EU axonomy for sus- tainable activities, plays a crucial role in his ransition. The taxonomy defines which activities are classified as sustaina- ble for each economic sector.2 The EU Sustainable Finance Action Plan links he EU axonomy o further disclosure requirements. For example, large capital market-oriented companies3 in he EU have been required o disclose he share of heir activities ha are aligned with he axonomy since he 2022 business year, and other companies will grad- ually follow.4 Banks mus also disclose heir share of activ- ities aligned with he axonomy, known as he green asse ratio.5 Financial providers ha advertise products with envi- ronmental features mus repor heir axonomy alignment.6 This classification system is primarily an instrumen for providing information and should increase ransparency for private consumers as well as institutional financial mar- ke actors so ha hey can inves heir capital more sustaina- bly. This should also enable hem o be er assess he risk of stranded assets7 and ake hese findings into accoun when allocating heir investments. 1 In Europe alone, investments of up o 350 billion euros per year in low-carbon infrastructure, such as renewable energy plants or electricity grids and storage facilities, will be required by 2030. Cf. Lena Klaaßen und Bjarne Steffen, “Meta-analysis on necessary investmen shifts o reach ne zero pathways in Europe,” Nature Climate Change 13 (2023): 58–66 (available online; accessed on July 1, 2024. This applies o all other online sources in his repor unless stated otherwise). 2 Franziska Schütze et al., “EU axonomy is increasing he ransparency of sustainable invest- ments,” DIW Weekly Repor no. 51 (2020) (available online). 3 The firs step will affec all companies ha are already required o repor under he Non-finan- cial Reporting Directive (NFRD). This includes capital market-oriented companies with more han 500 employees. 4 As a par of he Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD EU Regulation 2022/2464 (available online)), he group of companies obligated o repor will expand by non-capital mar- ket-oriented companies with",
      "over 250 employees or sales revenue greater han 50 million euros or a balance shee otal of over 24 million euros. 5 In accordance with Article 8 of he EU Taxonomy Regulation, cf. European Union, Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of he European Parliamen and of he Council of 18 June 2020 on he establish- men of a framework o facilitate sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (2020) (available online). 6 As par of he Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), see European Commission, Sustainability-related disclosure in he financial services sector (2024) (available online). 7 Stranded assets are investments or assets ha can no longer be used and which hus become unprofitable. For example, investments in a coal-fired power plan ha can no longer be operated due o climate policy measures can massively lose value. 191 DIW Weekly Repor 28/2024 Sustainable finance axonomies Box 1 Taxonomy developmen and erminology A sustainable finance axonomy1 (referred o here as a “taxonomy”) classifies sustainable activities and investments. The emergence of such axonomies in various countries, regions, and international organizations was driven in particular by he Paris Agreemen and the UN Sustainable Developmen Goals. However, he names of the axonomies vary, including he words “sustainable,” “green,” “climate,” “transition,” and “social” in heir itles, indicating differen types of axonomies. Sustainable axonomies are by definition he mos comprehensive, as he erm “sustainable” has an ecological, economic, and social dimension.2 Thus, a green axonomy focuses on pure green activities or hose ha positively contribute o he 1 In his Weekly Report, we use he general erm “sustainable finance axonomy” unless he ax- onomy is classified specifically as a green finance axonomy. 2 Bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbei und Entwicklung, Nachhaltigkei (in German; available online). environmental goals covered by he axonomy. However, he gran- ularity, scope, criteria, and environmental objectives of he axon- omies can differ broadly. Social axonomies focus mainly on he positive contribution o social objectives, such as decen work and adequate living standards.3 In contrast, ransition axonomies ake a more dynamic approach, as hey identify activities ha are no currently in accordance with he Paris Agreemen and have a lack of suitable “green” alternatives. If a axonomy exclusively promotes green activities, i excludes importan parts of he economy ha still need o be ransformed. A green or sustainable axonomy can also contain elements of ransition activities. 3 EU Platform on Sustainable Finance, Repor on Social Taxonomy.

Box 2 Criteria for estimating he ransition potential of taxonomies The ransition o climate neutrality is differen in every country due o individual circumstances. A “transition score” (TS) has been developed as an objective scoring system o enable a comparable assessmen of ransformation potential. This score consists of five criteria ha summarize he data on he axono- mies in a",
      "structured manner:1 policy embeddedness, sectoral coverage, screening approach, arge group, and reporting and disclosure (Table 1). There are four stages of fulfillmen for each criterion with assigned scores, here indicated in brackets:2 no contribution [1], li le contribution [2]; moderate contribution [3]; or high contribution [4]. 1 For a more detailed description of he criteria and scoring, cf. Marchewitz et al., “Sustain- able Finance Taxonomies.” 2 The criteria were weighted equally, as all five criteria are necessary for he econom- ic ransition. A differen weighting was also applied in he publication his Weekly Repor is based on, bu his did no fundamentally change he ranking. Table 1 Analysis criteria for measuring a axonomy’s potential contribution o he economic ransition Criterion Definition Policy embeddedness This criterion captures whether a axonomy refers o he climate targets in international frameworks such as he Paris Agreemen and he SDGs as well as national or regional climate argets. I also assesses whether i includes more comprehensive sustain- ability goals Sectoral coverage This criterion refers o he share of emissions explicitly ­covered in a axonomy, i.e., he sectors or echnologies explicitly men- tioned in he respective axonomy framework.1 Screening approach This criterion captures whether axonomies define (technical) selection criteria or hresholds for including economic activities and whether hese follow a credible, science-based decarboni- zation pathway. Targe group This criterion refers o which marke players in he financial sector and he real economy and which financial instruments (e. g. bonds, loans, guarantees, funds) are affected by he ­taxonomy. Reporting and ­disclosure This criterion assesses whether a axonomy is linked o reporting obligations for countries in he respective country. 1 We used he World Emissions Clock (WEC) o evaluate he percentual coverage of he country-specific greenhouse gas emissions per sector (available online).

Building upon his classification system, this Weekly Repor investigates he potential of he axono- mies developed worldwide o suppor he ransition o a cli- mate-neutral economy.10 Many axonomies are no suitable for supporting the ransition We used five criteria o analyze official documents of he 26 taxonomies already published and buil a ransition score (TS). The higher he TS, he higher he ransition potential. The TS makes i possible o compare he axonomies (Box 2), and he results of he comparison reveal a sca ered picture (Figure 2).11 The TS ranges from 2.0 o 3.6 points with an aver- age score of 2.8. The axonomies with he highes TS (three or more points, so a “moderate o high contribution”) are from he Association of Southeas Asian Nations (ASEAN), Columbia, EU, Georgia, Singapore, South Korea, and Sri Lanka. The axonomies with he lowes scores (between wo and 2.4 points, “li le contribution”) are from Israel, Malaysia, Russia, South Africa, and Uzbekistan. Many axonomies strive for a holistic sustainability approach In",
      "erms of policy embeddedness, i.e., how he axonomy refers o he goals in international frameworks such as he Paris Agreement, he analysis paints a predominantly posi- tive picture (Figure 3). Eighteen of he 26 axonomies received all four points for his criterion, while seven received hree points and Uzbekistan’s axonomy wo points. Some axon- omies also refer specifically o he nationally determined contributions (NDCs).12 In addition, he axonomies fre- quently mention he Paris Agreemen argets, he Sustainable Developmen Goals (SDGs), and he respective country’s national climate and energy policies. Several axonomies aim to extend heir scope o a broader range of environmental objectives, such as biodiversity and he ransition o a circu- lar economy. Thirteen axonomies, including he Columbian, Mongolian, Russian, South African, and Rwandan axono- mies, include nature-related aspects or plan o do so. Others consider specific regional aspects, such as he Islamic finan- cial system in Malaysia. Countries such as Georgia, Mongolia, and Mexico have already included social aspects, while coun- tries such as Brazil plan o include hem. This indicates ha many axonomies follow a holistic sustainability approach, 9 Mritiunjoy Mohanty and Runa Sarkar, The Role of Coal in a Sustainable Energy Mix for India (Routledge: 2024) (available online). 10 Catherine Marchewitz et al., “Sustainable Finance Taxonomies – Enabling he Transition o- wards Ne Zero?

The curren evaluation is based on he documents as of December 31, 2023. The value can change for countries in he developmen phase as soon as he taxonomy has been finalized and published. 12 Georgia, Indonesia, Columbia, Latin America and he Caribbean (LAC), Malysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka. even if he relationships between differen environmental and social opics are no completely considered and he cor- responding criteria have still no been developed. Share of emissions covered in axonomies varies considerably The share of emissions from he economic sectors explicitly covered in he respective axonomies13 varied greatly in 2022 (Figure 4). Explicitly covered means ha criteria and hresh- old values have been developed for hese economic activi- ties. Six axonomies cover less han 50 percen of emissions,14 while en others cover more han 90 percen of emissions.15 13 Some of he axonomies do no ye cover all sectors because hey are still in development. 14 These values are preliminary: For example, Hong Kong and Thailand have announced ha they wan o include more sectors in he nex revisions, as previously only drafts have been pub- lished. 15 Association of Southeas Asian Nations (ASEAN), Brazil, China, Columbia, South Korea, LAC, Mongolia, Philippines, Singapore.

Box 3 Approaches for screening economic activities in alignmen with he axonomy Generally, hree approaches are used o classify economic activities as aligned with a axonomy. These approaches par- tially overlap and are independently used or used ogether in combination (G20 SFWG, 2022). One approach involves ech- nical screening criteria (TSC design), which is used by many taxonomies, including he EU axonomy.1",
      "According o he TSC design, an economic activity is aligned with he axonomy if its expected contribution o an environmental objective defined in he axonomy meets a series of criteria and hreshold values for emission intensity. As he ype of echnology underlying an activity is no restricted, he TSC design is echnology neutral. In contrast, he whitelis design (WL) used in he axonomies of Bangladesh, China, Georgia, Russia, and Mongolia explicitly mentions he activities aligned with he axonomy and is hus technology specific. A “whitelist” means ha an activity is only in alignmen if i (i) is specifically listed in he axonomy and (ii) i meets he relevan national environmental performance standards. Finally, some axonomies follow a principles-based approach. This approach defines a se of core principles and is open o he ype of echnology used, such as in he ASEAN, Malaysian, Filipino, and Singaporean axonomies. Mos ax- onomies combine heir chosen approach with additional screening criteria, such as social minimum safeguards and/ or he “Do No Significan Harm” principle as well as specific exclusion criteria. 1 For example, EU, Colombia, South Korea, South Africa, Indonesia and Vietnam, as well as partially Uzbekistan. 195 DIW Weekly Repor 28/2024 Sustainable finance axonomies a leas include mandatory obligations for a defined lis of actors and products. The res of he axonomies only received two points each, as hey either only define a limited arge group or se ou a voluntary specification. Furthermore, in some cases, such as Bangladesh, China, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Vietnam, he axonomy only applies o specific financial instruments, such as green bonds.17 Taxonomies rarely linked o reporting obligations Many axonomies have no been directly linked o manda- tory disclosure and reporting obligations (Figure 7). In mos cases, companies are no required o disclose information or to repor abou heir alignmen with he axonomy. As axon- omies are often voluntary frameworks, hey are no linked o reporting obligations, even if some axonomies refer o exist- ing international standards and frameworks.18 The axono- mies of Bangladesh, China, Georgia, and he EU are some of he few ha have mandatory regulations. All marke par- ticipants who belong o he axonomies’ arge group mus disclose information and repor abou heir axonomy-re- lated activities. Thresholds help decarbonize activities in emission-intensive sectors Mos axonomies classify no only economic activities ha are already carbon neutral (such as solar and wind energy, electric vehicles, or similar) as sustainable, bu also some activities in emission-intensive sectors. In hese sectors, the exac criteria and hresholds are decisive for he ques- tion of o wha exten hey can potentially contribute o a cli- mate-neutral economy. However, he hresholds are no reg- ularly adjusted or are no dynamic in many axonomies. This can mean ha corresponding investments are no in accord- ance with he Paris Agreemen or lead o stranded assets. To illustrate he importance of dynamic hresholds, he crite- ria and hresholds for he energy and ransportation sectors used in he axonomies of he EU, Thailand, and Indonesia are compared",
      "below (Table 2). The path o carbon neutrality in he energy sector as well as in mos industrial sectors has no ye been defined in he EU taxonomy. For example, a binary hreshold was determined for he CO2 intensity of electricity generation (for example for electricity from hydropower plants, biomass, hea cogenera- tion, or gas-fired power plants). The axonomy in Thailand, in contrast, has a raffic ligh system and contains wo hresh- olds for he energy sector ha decrease over ime. The raf- fic ligh system in he Indonesian axonomy is also based on 17 While bonds continue o be an importan componen of projec financing, other financial prod- ucts such as loans, funds, insurance products, and blended financing also play an importan role. In many cases, loans remain he predominan form of projec financing, which is indicative of he diversity and complexity of he financial landscape. Cf. Frédéric Holm-Hadulla et al., “Firm deb financing structures and he ransmission of shocks in he euro area,” Economic Bulletin Articles 4 (2022) (available online). 18 The study only examined whether he axonomy refers o disclosure and reporting obliga- tions. I did no examine whether here are reporting obligations in he respective country ha in turn refer o he axonomy. international benchmarks in he strictes category bu does no require any hreshold reductions.19 In he ranspor sector, he EU axonomy defines a dynamic threshold for passenger and ligh commercial vehicles ha declines over he years. In he Thai axonomy, however, here is already a hreshold of zero emissions for passenger and ligh commercial vehicles. The examples illustrate ha differen countries and regions adjus hresholds differently, which can affec he speed of the ransition. Conclusion: Global standards for axonomies are essential Taxonomies are importan for defining sustainable activi- ties and hus for financing he ransition o a climate-neu- tral economy. With clear criteria and standards, axonomies can contribute o creating a robus marke for investments in climate-friendly activities. 19 The ASEAN Taxonomy raffic ligh system contains similar hresholds for he energy sector: For “green” (level 1), he hreshold is below 100 g CO2e/kWh. The “yellow” category is divided into “level 2” and “level 3” with he hresholds of 100 o 425 and 425 o 520 g of CO2e/kWh.

To realize he full potential of axonomies, hey should contain environ- mental and social standards ha are scientifically sound and provide a clear path o climate neutrality. Moreover, an adjust- men o international climate argets for all sectors mus be ensured. This requires a dynamic approach, meaning he taxonomy mus continually be revised and adjusted based on new scientific findings. In addition, a axonomy should be applied o all relevan financial instruments and actors in he financial sector and in he real economy and be a par of corporate reporting. Despite efforts o achieve international harmonization, here are major differences and divergen definitions of wha is “green” or “sustainable” around he world. Many firms and investors are active in multiple countries. To increase he effectiveness of he axonomies and o avoid shifting emis- sions abroad (carbon leakage), axonomies should be har- monized a he international level.

For he analysis, we use data from he Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), one of he few datasets in Germany ha contains representative data on general life satisfaction as well as on satisfaction with differen life domains (Box).7 The analy­ sis period is from 2004 o 2021, as income satisfaction has been included in he SOEP since 2004.8 Differences between women and men, eas and wes Germany, people with and withou children, people below and above 30, and people with low, middle, and high ne household incomes are ana­ lyzed descriptively in his period.9 These indicators have already shown meaningful differences in other analyses.10 The respondents rated heir satisfaction with differen life domains on a scale from 0 (no a all satisfied) o 10 (com­ pletely satisfied).

Major differences between general life satisfaction and satisfaction with differen domains Depending on he domain, he level of satisfaction and its developmen over he pas years differ greatly (Figure 1). In 2004, for example, general life satisfaction was rated he high­ es with an average of 6.7 points, while personal income sat­ isfaction was lowes with an average of 5.5 points. By 2021, both values had improved, with satisfaction with personal income (6.9) rising less steadily bu more strongly han gen­ eral life satisfaction (7.4). In comparison, he increase in real wages during a similar period, 2004 o 2019, was around en percent.11 Similarly, although no quite as steeply, work sat­ isfaction increased from 6.8 o 7.2. In contrast, health satis­ faction has remained constan",
      "over he years a around 6.5. Its only increase, o 6.9, occurred during he coronavirus pandemic in 2021. Women and eas Germans have caugh up in terms of income satisfaction There are considerable gender differences when i comes to personal income satisfaction: Compared o women, men have been consistently more satisfied with heir income over the years (Figure 2).12 In 2004, men were around 0.4 points 11 Guido Zinke, Lohnentwicklung in Deutschland und Europa (2020: Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung) (in German; available online). 12 This refers o labor income only.

Box Dataset: The Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) The Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) is a representative and multidisciplinary household survey. Households and heir members in Germany have been surveyed on heir general life situation on an annual basis since 1984.1 These surveys cover education, he labor marke situation, and health of he respondents. As of 2024, around 30,000 respondents from around 15,000 households are surveyed annually. Data on general life satisfaction and on personal income, work, and health satisfaction of he SOEP respondents were used for he analysis. Specifically, he respondents were asked: “How satis­ fied are you currently with [life domain]?” The respondents in­ dicated heir satisfaction on a scale of 0 (no a all satisfied) o 10 (completely satisfied). The question abou work satisfaction was only posed o people who are working. The question abou health satisfaction was posed o all people living in Germany. To be able o make be er comparisons over ime, refugees are no included in he analysis. 1 Jan Goebel e al., “The German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP),” Journal of Economics and Statistics 239, no. 2 (2019): 345–360. 214 DIW Weekly Repor 32+33+34/2024 SATISFACTION Figure 2 Income satisfaction Scale from 0 (no a all satisfied) o 10 (completely satisfied) Source: Authors’ calculations based on SOEP data. © DIW Berlin 2024 Over he years, men have been consistently more satisfied with heir personal income han women. 215 DIW Weekly Repor 32+33+34/2024 SATISFACTION more satisfied with heir personal income han women. In 2007, heir satisfaction increased o 0.6 points. After his, how­ ever, women’s satisfaction began o catch up and men were only 0.2 points more satisfied han women by 2021. While personal income satisfaction has increased over ime for both men and women, he increase was much greater for women. While here are many reasons for he gender gap in personal income satisfaction, he main reason is likely ha women still earn less han men. In 2005, he gender pay gap was around 16.8 percent. By 2021, i had shrunk o 13.5 percent.13 Thus, women and men have converged in erms of income satisfaction, similarly o how hey are converging in wages.",
      "he highes and middle incomes shrank (from 1.0 o 0.8) and the gap between he lowes and middle incomes remained the same (1.2). In principle, his gap indicates ha he addi­ tional satisfaction from additional income decreases along the income distribution. There are no discernible differences between people with and withou children over he entire period; both are equally satisfied with heir income. Differences in work satisfaction are comparably low Working women and men in Germany are similarly satis­ fied with heir work (Figure 3). Considering ha women, on average, repor lower satisfaction with heir personal income on average, his similarity is remarkable. While women are more dissatisfied han men in erms of heir income, other aspects of heir jobs, like colleagues, work hours, field, and the demands placed on such aspects do no appear o resul in differences in work satisfaction. Compared o wes Germany, people in eas Germany were more dissatisfied with heir work from 2004 o 2018. Despite this, he gap shrunk from 0.5 o 0.3 points in his period and there have been no more differences between he regions since 2019. One possible explanation for hese differences and he subsequen convergence could be economic differ­ ences between eas and wes Germany. For historical reasons, the economic structure in eas Germany differs greatly from tha in wes Germany. For example, people in eas Germany frequently work in differen professions han people in wes Germany.18 The headquarters and research departments of large companies are still located in he west. Above all, how­ ever, unemploymen in eas Germany was high for a long time, which likely resulted in a far more pronounced fear of unemploymen in he east.19 This could lead o average work satisfaction being lower in eas Germany compared o wes Germany. Catch-up processes may ultimately have led o a convergence of work satisfaction in eas and wes Germany. When comparing people under and over 30, i is noticeable tha he under-30 group has, on average, greater work sat­ isfaction han he over-30 group. This gap remained largely constan over he observation period. However, he differ­ ence in work satisfaction was only 0.2 points in 2021.

      "Pagenhardt, Marie Rullière, Jan-Christopher Scherer, Teresa Schildmann, Ruben Staffa, and Kristin Trautmann ABSTRACT The German economy continues o stagnate. After i appeared to finally be growing a he star of 2024, i experienced a sligh setback in he second quarter. Although incomes are rising and inflation is now near he wo-percen arget, people in Ger­ many are saving heir money. As investments and exports fal­ tered due o he sluggish industrial sector, he upturn has been delayed for he ime being. Overall economic outpu is likely o stagnate in 2024, bu i will likely pick up a he end of he year; growth of 0.9 and 1.4 percen is expected in 2025 and 2026, respectively. Private consumption, which will increase more slowly han expected bu still provide a stimulating effect, will primarily suppor his growth. As interes rates continue o fall worldwide, foreign rade and investments are also supporting growth. The global economy has returned o its recovery path, bu expanded more weakly in he second quarter compared to he first. Growth in China in particular has stalled somewhat, and here are also signs of an upcoming economic slowdown in he United States. Following growth of 3.8 percen in 2024, the global economy is expected o expand by only 3.5 percen in 2025, bu develop more dynamically again in 2026. Global economy: recovery expected o continue, while he US economy cools off The global economy weakened in he second quarter of 2024. Following a 1.0-percen increase in he firs quarter, i only grew by 0.7 percen in he second (Figure 1). Growth stalled in he emerging economies in particular; his was due o he developmen in China, where domestic demand remained weak. In contrast, a bi more momentum came from he advanced economies, especially he United States and he euro area, where inflation rates continued o decline. This resulted in a firs interes rate cu in he euro area in June. Carried by consumption and exports, he advanced econo­ mies expanded by 0.6 percen in he second quarter. The euro area economy remained on its recovery path and grew again by 0.3 percent. Foreign rade in particular made a positive contribution o growth due o rising exports. Spain (0.8 per­ cent) and he Netherlands (1.0 percent) provided particularly strong suppor for he economic recovery in he euro area. France and Italy also recorded positive quarterly growth in the second quarter, with 0.3 percen each. Germany was he only major euro area country o make a negative contribu­ tion o growth with -0.1 percent. In he United Kingdom, economic outpu continued o rise significantly by 0.6 per­ cent, supported primarily by a strong increase in inventories. The US economy also experienced strong growth of 0.7 per­ cen in he second quarter, still driven by robus consumer spending and corporate investments. In contras o its neg­ ative star o he year, Japan's GDP expanded by 0.8 percent. Tax relief and real wage growth as a resul of larger wage increases have spurred",
      "private consumption. Among he emerging economies, which expanded by 0.8 per­ cen overall, only China performed poorly: The Chinese econ­ omy grew by merely 0.7 percen in he second quarter, com­ pared o a strong 1,5 percen in he first. Negative factors, such as he still struggling real estate market, subdued domestic demand, and severe storms and flooding dampened growth, while fiscal and monetary policy measures only had a limited 225 DIW Weekly Repor 35–39/2024 DIW BERLIN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK impac on he problems in he real estate market.1 In contrast, strong foreign demand and governmen investments in he high-tech sector contributed positively o growth. The Indian economy continued o expand hanks o strong domestic economic activity. The Mexican and Brazilian economies continued o grow, although momentum is slowing some­ what. Restrictive monetary policy had an impac in hese countries and he expor sector fel he effects of he weaker global economy. Poland stands ou among he Central and Southeastern European countries with impressive quarterly growth of 1.5 percent. In he curren hird quarter, mos advanced economies are expected o contribute a bi less o he recovery han pre­ viously. In particular, he US economy is likely o contrac slightly as a resul of less dynamic consumption and a dete­ riorating situation in he labor market. By contrast, he euro area economy withou Germany is likely o continue its recov­ ery path. Steady growth in real wages will probably strengthen domestic demand. No momentum is expected from he euro area industry: While he Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Indices (PMI) of he individual euro area coun­ tries in he firs half of 2024 still showed signs of recovery, they have been declining again since June. Companies are pessimistic in erms of political uncertainty (France), declin­ ing orders and rising prices for intermediary goods and labor costs (Spain, Netherlands, Italy). The outlook is also deteriorating in mos Member States in he services sector, bu he indices remain above he expansion hreshold. The mood has improved in France due o he Olympic Games. The outlook for he hird quarter for he United Kingdom is good: Both he upward rend in he PMIs in all economic sectors and he rise in consumer confidence poin o a fur­ ther recovery. Real wage increases are likely o continue boosting consumption. In Japan, he recovery in domestic demand is providing sligh growth stimuli in he hird quar­ ter. A he same ime, here are also only very weak signals for a recovery in he Japanese manufacturing industries; he PMI has been stuck below he expansion hreshold of 50 for two months in a row. Growth is expected o be stronger in he emerging econo­ mies in he hird quarter han in he second quarter. The Indian economy should continue o grow dynamically. The Chinese economy is likely o benefi from rising exports and investments in he high-tech sector.

International rade is recovering slowly; powerful growth rates are no expected in 2024 overall. The ongoing global industrial weakness in he advanced economies will likely still weigh on international rade in 2025. Falling interes rates, however, should revive corporate investment, and hus also international rade, from mid 2025. Over he res of he forecas period, global growth rates are expected o be muted in 2025 before becoming more dynamic in 2026 (Table 1). In winter 2024/2025, inflation rates in many places will reach he arge corridor of he central banks. As interes rates fall, monetary policy in mos econ­ omies will switch from a restrictive policy o a more neu­ tral one by he end of 2025, hereby supporting economic Box 1 Assumptions and framework conditions This forecas is based on he following assumptions abou he further developmen of key interes rates, exchange rates, and commodity prices (Table). These assumptions were made based on previous development, futures markets prices, and he closing prices on he date of his forecas (Augus 19, 2024). The European Central Bank (ECB) firs decreased interes rates in June. After a year of stable interes rates, i has now initiated a urnaround. Six further interes rate cuts are assumed over he forecas hori­ zon, which are likely o ake place a every second ECB meeting. Specifically, i is assumed ha he ECB will cu interes rates for he second ime in September, again by 25 basis points. A he same time, he Central Bank will, as announced, decrease he interes rate corridor between he main refinancing rate and he deposi rate from 50 o 15 basis points. For some ime now, he ECB has been steering he economy via he deposi rate and no he main refinancing rate. The deposi rate is hus he key indicator for inter­ es rate changes. The subsequen interes rate cuts are assumed to be 25 basis points each, which results in a reduction of he de­ posi rate by 75 basis points in both 2024 and 2025. Money marke interes rates fell a he beginning of 2024 in antic­ ipation of he interes rate urnaround. I is assumed ha hese, in line with key interes rates, will continue o fall over he forecas horizon. The refinancing costs for households and companies are likely o decline as key interes rates fall over he coming years. The return on governmen bonds increased again slightly fol­ lowing a brief decline a he",
      "beginning of 2024. I is assumed ha capital marke interes rates will remain largely unchanged over the forecas horizon a 2.4 percen for Germany and 3.1 percen for he euro area. The euro has recently depreciated agains he US dollar due o he interes rate differential. For he forecas peri­ od, i is assumed ha he exchange rate of EUR o USD will remain a 1.09 USD per EUR. Uncertainties abou he gas supply in he coming year resulted in sligh increases in he wholesale price for gas (TTF) recently. However, well-filled gas storage facilities should preven a severe supply shortage. According o futures, he average gas price should be around 34.50 (2024), 41.90 (2025), and 35.70 euros (2026) per megawa hours. The price for Bren crude oil will de­ cline slightly over he forecas horizon according o raded futures.

In he advanced economies, he opposing rends between he United States and Europe are likely o con­ verge. While he United States has lef he euro area behind in erms of growth over he pas years, he situation here now seems o be deteriorating, while signs in he euro area are pointing o growth again. The gradual slowdown in economic momentum in he United States is primarily being driven by declining private consumption and he labor market. However, he labor mar­ ke seems o be more robus han he unemploymen rate, which has been higher since spring, would suggest. The unemploymen rate is likely overstated due o he immigra­ tion boom. Even if some indicators poin",
      "o an increased risk of a recession in he United States, a gradual slowdown in the pace of expansion seems more likely, especially as he US Federal Reserve has sufficien leeway o cu interes rates. In he euro area, on he other hand, he purchasing power of private households is likely o increase further hanks to lower inflation and higher nominal wages, even if real wages in he euro area are still one percentage poin below pre-pandemic levels and even further below pre-energy cri­ sis levels (Figure 2). The positive situation on he labor mar­ ke will likely continue o suppor he economy, although i has worsened slightly recently. Japanese GDP is likely o be above its potential growth in 2025 due o recovering domes­ tic demand and growing exports. The outlook for mos emerging economies over he forecas period is favorable.

Chinese GDP is likely o con­ tinue its powerful development, bu growth rates are likely to be lower han before he pandemic. The previous invest­ ment-driven growth model seems o have reached its lim­ its and has no been replaced by private consumption so far. On an annual average, he advanced economies are expected to expand by only 1.7 percen in 2024, while economic out­ pu will likely increase by 4.9 percen in he emerging econ­ omies. Overall, he global economy is expected o grow by 3.8 percen in 2024, 0.1 percentage points more han fore­ cas in summer. In 2025, global growth is likely o be some­ wha weaker a 3.5 percent, due o he US economy cooling down, before growing more dynamically again by 3.7 per­ cen in 2026. Thus, he forecas for 2025 is 0.1 percentage points less han expected in summer. This forecas is subjec o many uncertainty factors. For example, he inflation rates, especially in he United States and he euro area, could decline more slowly han expected, which would resul in a longer phase of restrictive mone­ tary policy and hus dampen economic growth. If inflation fell more quickly, in contrast, i could suppor consumption more and lead o more rapid interes rate cuts. Geopolitical risks remain quite high. The war in he Middle Eas could escalate further, which would likely lead o higher oil and natural gas prices. The war in Ukraine, he developmen of which is difficul o predict, is a further risk. Donald Trump’s possible re-election in November could lead o major uncer­ tainties regarding he direction of US economic and security policy. The rade conflic between China and he Wes could also escalate further and have a negative impac on interna­ tional rade. Generally, he risk of political polarization is high in many places; extremis parties are gaining ground worldwide. In he long erm, his populism harbors consid­ erable risks for growth and prosperity prospects, especially if i ignores or undermines fundamental economic principles. Figure 2 Real wages in",

Following a sligh 0.2 percen increase in GDP a the beginning of he year, his positive developmen did no continue: Economic outpu contracted slightly by 0.1 percen in he second quarter (Figure 33). A recovery failed o materi­ alize. On he one hand, private household consumption was significantly lower han he increase in disposable income since he energy crisis had suggested. On he other hand, investments in equipmen and in construction slumped and exports declined, probably primarily due o persisten low domestic and foreign demand for industrial goods. Private consumption contracted somewha in he second quarter: Private households seem o be unse led, both due to he political and economic conditions as well as he low bu steady rise in unemployment. This likely resulted in consumers consuming less in he second quarter han hey did a he beginning of he year, despite strong increases in real wages. In line with his, private households are saving a bi more of heir income: A 10.8 percent, he savings rate is currently slightly higher han in 2023.4 Consumer senti­ men is dampened, likely due o he high price level. While inflation has stabilized noticeably recently and consistently been under hree percen since he beginning of 2024, core inflation and he price increases in he services sector in par­ ticular have remained elevated, likely having curbed con­ sumption. As expected in early summer, he UEFA European Men’s Football Championship did no noticeably boos pri­ vate consumption in Germany. Foreign rade also did no provide any growth stimuli in the second quarter. While strong exports of intermediate goods, such as chemical and plastic products, had indicated a recovery in he global industry5 and hus German rade a he beginning of he year, exports of hese goods signifi­ cantly declined again in he second quarter. Although ravel boosted service exports, i was unable o preven he decline in exports overall. Service imports also experienced strong growth, while goods imports fell slightly. Overall, imports stagnated, resulting in a slightly negative balance of exports and imports in he second quarter. The decline in investments was even greater. Particularly pri­ vate investmen in equipmen suffered a serious slump; in the second quarter, i was a its lowes level since he produc­ tion restrictions during he coronavirus pandemic. In con­ trast, public equipmen investmen had a stimulating effect. The downward rend of recen years also continued in con­ struction investment, which declined significantly, mainly in residential and public construction. 3 Detailed figures on he forecas for he Germany economy can be found in he online appendix (in German). 4 The general revision",
      "of he VGR data results in he savings rate for Germany being revised downward significantly. Until recently, he data showed a significantly higher savings rate level than was he case before he coronavirus pandemic. 5 For more, see he section on he global economy in his Weekly Report. The evolution of gross value added (GVA) in he second quar­ ter shows ha he gap between he services and manufactur­ ing sectors is growing. Overall, GVA declined by 0.1 percent, the same rate as GDP. While production declined slightly in manufacturing, i plummeted in he construction industry. As a result, he manufacturing industry as a whole reduced GVA by 0.3 percent. Services increased slightly, supporting GVA by 0.1 percent. However, i was a mixed picture in he individual economic sectors. Value added in he consum­ er-related sectors decreased, while business-related services were able o expand heir production. This developmen in value added is also reflected in he lates labor marke figures: employmen has continued o rise overall, albei a a slightly slower rate han a he beginning of he year. Employmen expanded in he services sector bu declined in he ailing manufacturing industry as well as construction. Overall, however, he labor marke has so far remained stable, even if unemploymen is rising. Stagnation expected in he hird quarter for he German economy The recovery of he German economy is likely o remain elusive in he curren hird quarter; GDP is no projected to increase (Table 2). Private consumption is still projected to expand, although less powerfully han was implied in spring (Figure 4). Consumer confidence indicators, which rose steadily during he firs half of 2024, have recently expe­ rienced a sligh downturn. Households’ willingness o spend Figure 3 Growth of real GDP in Germany In billions of euros (lef axis) and quarter-on-quarter percentage growth (righ axis) Note: Forecas from he hird quarter of 2024; price, seasonally, and calendar adjusted.

A he same ime, he strong real wage increases since mid-2023 have extensively compensated for the losses during he energy crisis and are expected o suppor consumption in he second half of 2024. Low-income house­ holds have likely continued o experience strong income growth recently, which should benefi private consump­ tion, as hese households have a higher propensity o con­ sume. Income for higher income groups, in contrast, has increased somewha less strongly han previously. As a result, labor income inequality should remain he same his year (Figure 5). Additionally, consumer price inflation is contin­ ually declining, and—especially hanks o decreasing energy prices—fell below he wo-percen arge for he firs ime since March 2021 in August 2024, bringing he annual aver­ age closer o he inflation",
      "arge of he European Central Bank (ECB). Leading price indicators such as impor and whole­ sale prices also sugges his. Although some of hese indi­ cators are rising again, he rates remain well below wo per­ cent. Stable price developmen should strengthen consumer confidence once more and stimulate private consumption. Robus employmen expansion, which he services sector will likely continue o drive, should also suppor private con­ sumption. Cyclical unemploymen is expected o continue to rise slightly due o weak economic developmen (Table 3). Investments are expected o make a negative contribution o economic growth again in he curren quarter. Investmen in equipmen continues o suffer due o weak industrial pro­ duction and a lack of demand; he stock of existing orders is shrinking while new orders are faltering. In construction, despite he initiated interes rate shift, he persistently high interes rates and he high and continuously rising construc­ tion costs remain he key obstacles and are likely o further slow down residential construction in he second half of he year. Although he volume of new residential construction loans has increased somewha again recently, his is no ye reflected in he approval and order figures. Corporate capac­ ity utilization in building construction recently declined o its lowes value since 2010. In contrast, civil engineering is expected o continue o suppor construction investment. The demand from abroad for German intermediate and capi­ tal goods is also likely o remain weak in he curren quarter. The ifo Expor Expectations fell for he hird ime in a row in August; hus, another decline in goods exports is expected for he hird quarter. Service exports, which make up a good 20 percen of German foreign rade, should expand further due o he growing importance of he domestic and foreign service sectors. The IT sector in particular as well as our­ is raffic are carrying his development, although hey are unlikely o be able o increase otal exports. In ligh of weak exports and sluggish industrial output, imports are expected to continue o develop meekly, although goods imports are also expected o fall and services imports o increase in he curren global and domestic economic environment. Overall, a negative rade balance is projected for he hird quarter.

Although sentimen in both sectors has recently deteriorated somewha according o he Purchasing Manager Indices for Germany, sentimen remains more robus and above he expansion hreshold of 50 points in the services sector, supported by growing demand. In he industrial sector, in contrast, he index is consistently below the expansion hreshold. According o he ifo Business Climate Index survey in August, he business climate in the industrial sector has fallen for he hird ime in a row, with he respondents rating both he curren situation and future business as critical. The lack of orders is increas­ ingly becoming a problem and will likely impede produc­ tion in he curren quarter. Gradual recovery over he course of he forecast The German economy is expected o recover over he course of he forecast, although more sluggishly han he indica­ tors suggested during he summer. In erms of he domes­ tic economy,",
      "he positive real wage rend, which should be supported by low inflation rates and continue hroughou he forecas period, is likely o have he greates impac initially. While employees’ bargaining power has weakened somewha with he sligh decline in he Labor Shortage Index, he col­ lective wage negotiations planned for he end of 2024, such as in he public sector as well as he metalworking and elec­ trical industry, are expected o resul in further strong nom­ inal wage increases. Unemploymen will reach its peak a the beginning of 2025 and decline as he economy recovers and integration processes, particularly of Ukrainian refu­ gees, progress. This developmen benefits private consump­ tion, which is expected o suppor economic outpu a he turn of he year. Governmen consumption should continue to contribute positively o GDP. Expenditure on a moderate increase in employmen in he public sector is likely o sup­ por growth in 2024 and 2025, while social benefits in kind, particularly in he areas of health and care services, will prob­ ably be expanded hroughou he forecas period. German foreign rade is no expected o noticeably increase again until 2025. Supported by falling interes rates world­ wide and a gradual upturn in investmen activity abroad, demand for German industrial goods should rekindle. However, German goods exports are unlikely o expand as dynamically as in he pas due o strong competition from China. As a result, he share of services of otal exports should increase further over he forecas horizon. Goods imports will likely benefi from he recovery of he expor business and he improvemen in German industrial production and pick up. As German exports of industrial and capital goods should be somewha weaker, goods imports will probably exceed exports in relative erms. This results in a slightly negative rade balance for he German economy in both 2025 and 2026 (Table 4). Rising foreign demand should boos private equipmen investmen again from he second half of 2025.

In 2024, his is primarily due o he expiry of measures ha were initi­ ated o mitigate he energy crisis, as well as consolidation measures, such as cuts o he Climate and Transformation Fund (Klima- und Transformationsfonds). There will be hus fewer expansive stimuli from he Growth Opportunities Ac (Wachstumschancengesetz) as well as fewer adjustments to he income ax rate (Box 3).

Box 3 Fiscal policy measure assumptions Expansive fiscal policy measures ha were implemented during the energy crisis and are now expiring are being followed by less comprehensive new programs. Thus, here will be a considerable negative fiscal stimulus (Table) his year. The expiry of he electricity and gas price brakes as well as he end of aid for hospitals and care facilities as a par of he energy crisis has he greates impact. On he expenditure side, his is offse by additional expenditure from he Climate and Transformation Fund (Klima- und Transformationsfonds, KTF) (promoting energy effi­ ciency in he building sector, subsidies for constructing refueling and charging infrastructure and he end of he EEG surcharge for consumers) as well as expenditure from he special fund for the Bundeswehr and suppor for Ukraine. These are significan in themselves, bu quantitatively smaller han he spending cuts. On he income side of he government, he increase in he carbon price and he ruck oll as well as he increase in he air raffic",
      "ax will resul in more revenue for local authorities. A restrictive effec also comes from he income side of social insurance. The increase in he contribution rate for statutory long-term care insurance on July 1, 2023, still has an impac his year. Moreover, i is assumed ha he state health insurance providers will slightly increase heir supple­ mental premium on average compared o 2023. As i is assumed tha he ax-free inflation compensation premium will accoun for a smaller share of wage increases in 2024 compared o 2023, his will also have a restrictive effec on household labor income. Overall, fiscal policy is likely o have a dampening effec on economic activity this year with growth of 0.7 percen in relation o GDP. Fiscal policy measures will be restrictive overall in 2025, oo, as ax and duty increases will predominate on he income side and cuts will have a greater impac han spending increases on he expend­ iture side. Overall, he budge impac of fiscal policy measures is likely o amoun o 0.4 percen of economic outpu in 2025. The expiry of he inflation compensation premium, a further in­ crease in he carbon price, and any increases in social security contribution rates resul in higher revenue increases on he income side han adjustments o he income ax rate as par of he elimina­ tion of bracke creep and ax breaks from he Growth Opportunities Ac (Wachstumschancengesetz) will reduce governmen revenue. On he expenditure side, he introduction of he basic child security, a further increase o he child benefit, he measures included in he Long-Term Care Suppor and Relief Ac (Pflegeunterstützungs- und Entlastungsgesetz), and further additional expenditure on defense will likely provide stimulating effects. In contrast, cuts o suppor o Ukraine as well as o he KTF mean ha overall expenditure will be lower han in 2024 and hus have a restrictive fiscal effect. In 2026, fiscal policy measures will balance each other out, result­ ing in an effec of zero in relation o GDP. Primarily adjustments o the income ax rates, such as he elimination of bracke creep, will lead o a reduction in governmen revenue, which in urn increases the income of private households and hus has an expansionary effect. The collective depreciation reform as well as he extension of he degressive depreciation for assets also contribute o he expansive nature of he income side. Conversely, social security contributions are expected o be raised further and revenue from fuel emissions rading should continue o suppor he general gov­ ernmen budget. On he expenditure side, investments within he scope of he special fund for he Bundeswehr in particular will have an impact. However, he effec will be dampened by further consol­ idation measures in he KTF. 235 DIW Weekly Repor 35–39/2024 DIW BERLIN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK Table Fiscal measures: General governmen budge burdens (−) and relief (+) In billions of euros (compared o previous year) 2024 2025 2026 Local governmen revenue Annual Tax Ac 2022 0.2 1.0 −1.1 Inflation Adjustmen Ac",

      "2024 236 DIW Weekly Repor 35–39/2024 DIW BERLIN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK Overall, governmen deficits are expected o decrease slightly over he forecas period, falling from 2.6 percen in relation to GDP in 2024 o 2.3 percen in 2025 and further o 1.7 per­ cen in 2026 (Figure 6). All in all, price-adjusted GDP will likely stagnate in 2024. Economic outpu is expected o grow by 0.9 percen in 2025 and by 1.4 percen in 2026. Thus, DIW Berlin is lowering its forecas for 2024 by 0.3 percentage points and for 2025 by 0.4 percentage points compared o he summer forecast. The forecas was revised downward primarily due o a revi­ sion of he reported data and he significantly weaker indica­ tors for he German and global economy over he summer. Due o ongoing weak investmen and declining labor force potential, potential GDP is likely o continue o develop slug­ gishly until he end of 2029. The labor volume in particu­ lar will decline as a resul of he aging population. In ligh of he stagnation his year, he outpu gap is likely o grow and amoun o -1.9 percen of potential GDP on average for 2024. With he recovery over he coming years, he outpu gap should hen shrink o -0.6 percen a he end of he shor term and close in 2029. Average consumer price inflation should be 2.2 percen in 2024. In 2025 and 2026, i will likely level off a he ECB's two-percen inflation arget. Thus, he inflation expectation for 2024 is slightly lower compared o summer, while i remains unchanged for 2025. The core rate, inflation exclud­ ing energy and food, is expected o average hree percen in 2024 due o continuous strong price increases for services. I will also reach he wo-percen arge over he course of the forecast. In addition o he global risks ha are creating uncertainty for the outlook of he German economy, here are also domes­ tic risk factors. Above all, his includes political uncertainty, which is currently close o its all-time high according o he Economic Policy Uncertainty Index. Although he German Federal Governmen was recently able o agree on a draf budge for 2025, here are still concerns ha he coalition parties—which are pursuing differen objectives in many areas—are o a certain exten unable o ake action. This makes for an unclear economic policy framework, which could more negatively impac he domestic economy han assumed in his forecast. The recen results of he state elections in Thuringia and Saxony and he rise of he populis forces here also pose an additional risk. These results could increase he skilled worker shortage and reduce Germany’s a ractiveness as an economic location. In addition, right-wing and left-wing populis parties could perform well in he upcoming 2025 Bundestag elections and increase uncertainty with regard o he subsequen forma­ tion of a government.

This led o consumer price inflation in he euro area far beyond he ECB’s inflation arge of wo percent, a imes up o 10 percent. A he same ime, he euro area economy was hreatened by a recession, which resulted in he ECB facing conflicting objectives of stabilizing he economy and combating inflation. Estimates show ha while the ECB’s policy strategy of maintaining a low level of interes rates did improve he economy, i also exacerbated he rise in energy prices. The empirical analysis demonstrates ha an interes rate hike a he beginning of he energy crisis would have stabilized inflation more effectively. Tightening mone­ tary policy would have curbed energy demand and caused the euro o appreciate, which would have led o a more rapid decline in energy prices. In his counterfactual scenario, he euro area would have had o endure a brief recession, bu he overall economic situation would have stabilized by he fourth quarter of 2023. The ECB would likely have been be er able o follow its price stability mandate if a capital markets and fiscal union existed in he euro area. Few issues stir up emotions in Germany as much as infla­ tion. I affects everyone: People’s savings lose value, heir real wages decline. Moreover, he European Central Bank’s (ECB) conventional response o a rise in inflation may have a drastic impac on individual households; home loans will become more expensive and job security will become more a risk. Thus, how o bes contain inflation is a hotly con­ tested opic. In essence, he optimal response is always a rade-off between combating inflation on he one hand and he consequences of combating it, i.e., dampened economic developmen and the associated rise in unemployment, on he other. When confronted with his rade-off, policymakers end o decide to olerate rising inflation rather han he real economic con­ sequences of combating it; as German Chancellor Helmu Schmid said in 1972, “Be er five percen inflation han five percen unemployment.”1 However, policymakers frequently do no consider he dam­ aging effects of inflation on he population, such as a loss of purchasing power of savings; lower real purchasing power of salaries and pensions; he corresponding adjustments in the economy; and he implied redistribution of wealth from creditors o debtors. When he ECB was founded in 1998, grea value was placed on its primary objective of price stability—two percen infla­ tion over he medium erm of around wo years—and neces­ sary independence from politics. While supporting general economic policies is its secondary objective, he ECB’s man­ date clearly states ha he secondary objective may only be pursued if his does no compromise he primary",
      "objective.2 Thus, he ECB’s decision o no increase interes rates amid rising inflation in early 2022 stirred up controversy. ECB 1 In a July 28, 1972, interview with he Süddeutsche Zeitung, Helmu Schmid said, “I seems o be ha he German people—to pu i bluntly—can be er deal with a five percen increase in pric­ es han five percen unemployment.” The abridged quotation is from he October 14, 2006, issue of Der Spiegel (in German; available online. Accessed on October 2, 2024. This applies o all other online sources in his report). 2 Michael Ioannidis e al., “The mandate of he ECB: Legal considerations in he ECB’s monetary policy strategy review,” ECB Occasional Paper Series no. 276 (2021). 243 DIW Weekly Repor 40+41+42/2024 MONETARY POLICY Presiden Christine Lagarde defended he decision, saying tha an interes rate hike could no stop he increase in prices. This statemen was based on he fac ha he price increases in he euro area were primarily due o higher energy prices. A widely held opinion was ha an interes rate hike would miss he mark: Although i would curb overall economic demand and hus economic developmen in he euro area, i would have no impac on energy prices, which are primarily determined on he world market.3 This assumption allowed the ECB o—despite its primary mandate and excessive infla­ tion—choose a strategy ha did no endanger he economic recovery of he euro area. Using a ime series model, his Weekly Repor investigates he effects of his monetary policy strategy. Furthermore, i empirically analyses which mone­ tary policy strategy he ECB could have used o provide he optimal response o rising energy prices while stabilizing inflation a wo percent, and wha impac his strategy would have had on he economic developmen of he euro area. 3 However, studies show ha his view is based on erroneous assumptions and ha he ECB’s decisions do influence energy prices within he euro area as well as global energy prices, cf.

A brief introduction o empirical monetary policy analysis We use an empirical model o analyze he macroeconomic effects of he ECB’s monetary policy response o he mos recen surge in inflation.4 This model incorporates he dynamic relationships between he macroeconomic vari­ ables and, furthermore, makes i possible o calculate he causal effects of he ECB’s monetary policy strategy. These effects can in urn be broken down into wo parts using he empirical model. One par is he policy rule, which repre­ sents he endogenous componen of monetary policy and describes how he ECB’s interes rate policy responds his­ torically and systematically o changes in inflation and eco­ nomic output. The other par is an exogenous componen tha includes monetary policy shocks, unexpected deviations from his systematic rule, such as he ECB’s decision o raise 4 This Weekly Repor is based on",
      "Gökhan Ider, Alexander Kriwoluzky, Frederik Kurcz, and Ben Schumann, “Friend, No Foe – Energy Prices and European Monetary Policy,” DIW Discussion Papers no. 2089 (2024) (available online). The paper also contains a horough description of he methodology. Box 1 Model and data We use a structural vector autoregressive ime series model (SVAR) o investigate how he monetary policy decisions of he ECB have impacted consumer prices, energy prices, and industrial production in he euro area since January 2020. Mathematically, the model can be wri en as: BY = c + AYt−1 + … + ApYt−p + εt. where vector Y indicates he values of he endogenous variables a ime , whereby Yt−1 indicates he values of hese variables in he previous period. Thus, he developmen of all variables in he com­ mon system depends on he value of he other variables a ime and he value of he variables in he pas p periods. These mutual interdependencies are characterized by he matrices B and A. Vector ε describes he “structural shocks” ha he economy is ex­ posed o in each period and are he drivers of he dynamic system. The SVAR model in his Weekly Repor builds off an empirical model from an earlier Weekly Repor and models he common developmen of en macroeconomic variables.1 Monthly data are used for he estimation. The sampling period was from January 2002 o October 2023, including he coronavirus pandemic. To accoun for he impac of pandemic-related factors and o estimate their economic effects, we use a process particularly developed for this purpose.2 1 Gökhan Ider e al., “And Ye They Move: Energy Prices Fall When Key Interes Rates Increase, Despite Countervailing Effects,” DIW Weekly Repor no. 8 (2023): 73-80 (available online). 2 Danilo Cascaldi-Garcia, “Pandemic priors,” International Finance Discussion Paper 1352 (2022). The SVAR model makes i possible o decompose he ECB’s monetary policy and he associated interes rate path into wo components. Firs is he monetary policy rule, which represents the endogenous components of monetary policy, describes how the interes rate policy of he ECB responds historically and sys­ tematically o changes in inflation, economic output, and other endogenous variables. Second is he exogenous componen ha describes monetary policy shocks, or unexpected deviations from this systematic rule. To estimate he causal effects of unexpected conventional monetary policy shocks and shocks due o monetary policy announcements (forward guidance), he changes in financial marke expectations are measured over short-term interes rates (three months) as well as longer-term interes rates (two years) in a 30-minute ime window around he ECB’s monetary policy deci­ sions. If he expectations change in his ime window, hen here is an unexpected and hus exogenous componen in he ECB’s decision with which he financial markets, and hus companies and households, did no expect.3 Based on his identifying assumption, the historical decomposition makes i possible o calculate he role of he exogenous componen and hus he impac of deviations from he monetary policy rule.4 3 For a more detailed explanation of",

This Weekly Repor firs estimates he contribution of he exogenous componen of monetary policy on he European economy and investigates how he economy would have developed withou he exogenous component, meaning with­ ou a deviation from its historical, systematic monetary pol­ icy. This sheds ligh on o wha exten he policy strategy cho­ sen was historically unusual and wha its impac was. We then examine wha impac he optimal design of he endog­ enous componen would have had on he developmen of the economy. ECB policy contributed o economic recovery We employ a process called historical decompositions o analyze if and o wha exten he ECB deviated from its ra­ ditional monetary policy rule during he previous inflation surge and wha he macroeconomic effects of his deviation are (Box 1). This makes i possible o decompose he ime series of variables into a rend ha is independen of mone­ tary policy shocks and curren short-term economic develop­ ments as well as into deviations from his rend. These devi­ ations from he rend, in urn, can be explained by structural shocks, such as exogenous events (like he coronavirus pan­ demic), unexpected changes in he supply of and demand for goods and services, and unexpected monetary policy shocks. The ECB can change short-term interes rates unexpect­ edly, which is generally described as a conventional mone­ tary policy shock. I can also influence longer-term interes rates by applying “forward guidance,” or making a surprise announcemen on its future monetary policy intentions. The results of he historical decomposition show ha eco­ nomic activity in he euro area, measured by industrial pro­ duction, experienced a sharp decline and was well below the rend rate a he onse of he pandemic. The model cor­ rectly a ributes his decline o he effects of he coronavirus pandemic (Figure 1). The ECB responded o hese extraor­ dinary circumstances and passed surprising, expansionary monetary policy measures o stimulate aggregate demand and suppor he recovery of he European economy, such as the extensive Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP).

A he beginning of 2022, inflation was over hree percentage points higher han he wo percen ar­ ge and rose subsequently o an unprecedented level. The historical decomposition analysis shows ha pandemic-re­ lated factors and other non-monetary shocks, such as Russia’s tightened energy supply since 2021 and he Russian inva­ sion of Ukraine in February 2022, were primarily responsi­ ble for he surge in inflation. However, he ECB’s expansion­ ary monetary policy also played a major role. In particular, he ECB’s lack of response o he rise in infla­ tion actually represented a deviation from its monetary pol­ icy rule. Thus, he monetary policy followed by he ECB during he 2022 inflation surge was unusually expansion­ ary. The results show ha withou he deviation from he empirically estimated historical monetary policy rule, energy and consumer price inflation would have been much lower. In October 2022, for example, when consumer price infla­ tion was eigh percentage points above he wo percen ar­ get, nearly 1.8 percentage points of his increase were due to monetary policy shocks and hus he ECB. The situation is similar for energy prices, where, for example, up o five percentage points of he observed price increase of 30 per­ cen in January 2022 can be a ributed o expansionary mon­ etary policy measures. Economic developmen under an optimal monetary policy rule While he firs analysis provides insigh into he importance of he unexpected, exogenous componen of monetary pol­ icy during he las surge of inflation, he second par of his Weekly Repor analyzes he endogenous component, i.e., the systematic reaction of he interes rates o changes in the economy. This componen plays a particularly impor­ tan role in firms’ and households’ expectations regarding future economic development. Prices and wages are se or negotiated in view of expected inflation. A he same ime, firms and households make decisions abou long-term invest­ ments and consumption, forming heir expectations of future interes rates and economic activity depending on he per­ ceived monetary policy rule. If monetary policy now system­ atically operates in such a way ha households and firms are firmly convinced ha he ECB will resolutely counter devi­ ations in inflation from he wo percen arget, hey will no expec high inflation rates and will adjus heir expectations abou future interes rates as well as heir consumption and investmen decisions accordingly. For he following analysis, i is assumed ha he ECB is focus­ ing solely on its primary mandate of price stability and ha",
      "there are no deviations from his objective. Thus, he ECB influences shor and longer-term interes rates in such a way ha inflation is a wo percen in he medium erm and ignores everything else, such as general economic develop­ ments. The analysis uses an empirical model ha makes i possible o answer he counterfactual question of how he economy in he euro area would have developed if he ECB had focused chiefly on its primary mandate, an inflation ar­ ge of abou wo percen (Box 2). In his counterfactual scenario, he economy faces he same shocks as was he reality—the coronavirus pandemic and he energy price crisis—bu he ECB responds systematically o Box 2 Estimating economic developmen under mandate-optimal monetary policy To calculate he economic developmen ha would have oc­ curred under a mandate-optimal monetary policy, we assume tha he ECB selects its systematic interes rate policy and thus its monetary policy in a way ha i can optimally achieve its primary mandate of price stability. This means ha he ECB aims o minimize deviations from he inflation arge of wo percent. This can be expressed in a loss function: . This loss function cumulates he inflation deviation from he two percen arget, whereby he various weights (wi) are se­ lected in such a way ha inflation deviations in he “medium term” are given a particularly high weighting. This accounts for he fac ha he ECB defines its primary mandate as price stability in he “medium erm,” which, in practice, is considered to be four o six quarters. Empirical methods can be used o calculate an optimal monetary policy rule.1 Based on his, i is possible o simulate how he euro area economy would have developed from April 2021 onward if he ECB’s declared ob­ jective had been o achieve he primary mandate in he mos optimal way. This means ha he economy in his scenario continues o be exposed o he same exogenous shocks, in­ cluding he coronavirus pandemic and he energy price crisis. However, he ECB responds differently o hese events in his scenario, which is why he macroeconomic impac of hese exogenous shocks is different. A he same ime, he ECB’s alternative monetary policy changes he existing economic developmen even withou he resulting change in he effects of he new exogenous shocks. This is because a change in he monetary policy rule also influences dynamic adjustmen pro­ cesses within he economy ha were already initiated before the change. The sum of hese responses o new exogenous shocks and he already existing dynamic adjustmen process­ es results in an interes rate path for he shor and longer-term interes rates, which influences he overall economic situation and he financial markets and ultimately leads o he ECB opti­ mally achieving its primary mandate.2 1 Tomas E.

This response results in an interes rate path for the shor and longer-term interes rates ha influences he overall economic situation and he financial markets and ultimately leads o he ECB optimally achieving its primary mandate (Box 2). Earlier ECB intervention could have prevented he inflation surge The developmen of interes rates under a mandate-optimal policy rule differs greatly from heir actual development. In particular, he ECB should have implemented a strong ini­ tial interes rate hike by increasing he short-term and long- term interes rates by up o 100 basis points. According o the estimates, he ECB could have prevented he sharp rise in inflation with his strategy. One reason for his is ha he ECB’s interes rate policy, contrary o he ECB’s assumptions described above, directly influences energy prices and he higher interes rates are very quickly reflected in noticeably lower energy prices. For example, a change in he monetary policy course would have caused demand for energy in he euro area o drop drastically while simultaneously appreciating he euro. This would have further dampened energy price inflation in he euro area.5 Another reason is ha an announcemen ha he ECB would pursue a policy aimed primarily and vigorously a stabiliz­ ing inflation a wo percen would also have mean ha infla­ tion expectations would no have risen so sharply. This in turn would have reduced inflationary pressures, as produc­ ers, among others, would have forecas lower future costs. Due o he less pronounced rise in inflation, he ECB would have hen avoided higher interes rates from 2023 onward. Combating inflation would have led o only a short- term economic slump Such a change in monetary policy would have led o an ini­ tial sharper drop in production as measured by industrial production. Considering he relative volatility of GDP and industrial production, we see ha GDP would have been around hree percen below its actual level a he rough of the crisis if he ECB had stabilized inflation a around wo percen (Figure 2). However, his slump would have been brief; otal production would have returned o its actual level by he end of 2023. This shows ha he conflicting objectives faced by he ECB during he energy crisis were of a short- term nature. This surprising resul is because, contrary o its own statements and assumptions, he ECB can in fac directly influence energy prices by curbing energy demand and appreciating he euro.6 Thus, he ECB could have coun­ teracted he rise in inflation driven by he increase in energy 5 Ider e al., “And Ye They Move.” 6 Ider e al., “And Ye They Move”; Alexander Roth and Felix Schmidt, “No only a mild winter: German consumers change heir behavior o save natural gas,” Joule 7, no. 6 (2023): 1081–1086 (available online).

Conclusion: ECB caugh between price stability and limited capacity for action The results of his Weekly Repor sugges ha he ECB con­ tributed o a further increase in prices with its hesitan action, including both he exogenous components ha fueled he rise in prices and he ECB’s wait-and-see response. With a stricter and more vigorous monetary policy course, he ECB would have been able o preven inflation rising o 10 percen a he cos of a brief recession a a ime in which he economy was already weakened by he coronavirus pandemic and he Russian invasion of Ukraine. The ECB may have no wanted to exacerbate he situation. In addition, concerns abou he stability of he financial sector may also have prompted he ECB o no raise interes rates oo quickly. The ECB’s false assumption ha i canno influence energy prices may have led i o pu more weigh on stabilizing he economic and political situation in he euro area, rather han following its primary mandate of price stability. Ultimately, however, he analysis also shows ha i has become more challenging for he ECB o fulfill its primary mandate of price stability in he economic environmen a tha ime. This is because i would have needed he free­ dom o no have o consider he economic situation in he larges economies (Germany, France, and Italy) as well as their national deb and financial markets when raising inter­ es rates.

Otherwise, i will continue o face he impossible challenge of squaring he circle. 7 Former ECB Presiden Mario Draghi also recently made similar suggestions for improve­ ment, cf.

      "rad­ ing system o he European Emissions Trading System (EU ETS2) from 2027, final consumer prices for fossil motor and heating fuels are likely o rise significantly. This increase will affec low-income households more noticeably, as hey spend a larger share of heir income on energy han high-income households. Existing relief measures, such as he basic income scheme, he housing benefit, and subsidy programs, only partially reach hese groups. A climate dividend ha is auto­ matically paid ou o all residents largely mitigates excessive effects of he carbon pricing burden. However, additional aid and subsidy programs are required due o he remaining bur­ dens on vulnerable low-income households with high energy consumption. These programs could be financed if above- average and high-income earners did no receive he climate dividend. Carbon pricing does no affec hese groups as much and hey generally have more opportunities o reduce heir fossil energy consumption. Thus, he climate dividend should be paid o all households, bu reduced unbureaucratically as a par of wage and income axes for above-average and high- income earners. Carbon pricing is a key instrumen o achieving climate targets in Germany and Europe. Since 2005, he European Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS1) has captured he carbon emissions of he energy industry, industrial pro­ cesses, other large combustion plants, and aviation. In 2021, Germany introduced its national emissions rading system (national ETS) for fossil and heating fuels in he heating and transportation sectors. Currently, he carbon price is 45 euros per on; by 2026, i will increase up o 65 euros per on.1 The European Emissions Trading System for fuels (EU-ETS2) will be introduced in 2027 and integrate he existing national ETS. Due o he stric European emission caps and, in some cases, li le progress in decarbonization in Europe, i is expected ha he carbon price for motor and heating fuels will rise significantly. According o studies, prices of 200 euros per on are possible.2 The effects on he end consumer prices expected for 2026 may herefore increase many imes over.3 On average, low-income households spend a higher share of heir ne income on energy and ransportation costs han above-average and high-income earners (Figure 1). Therefore, due o he rising carbon price, hey have a greater burden relative o income han higher-income households. Carbon pricing, withou other relief for household budgets, hus 1 If fully passed on, a carbon price of 65 euros per on including VAT in 2026 results in a share of he final consumption price of 17.9 cents per liter for E10 and 20.5 cents per liter for diesel and heating oil each.

A he same ime, i either does no or only marginally reduces incentives o save energy through he “income effect.” 5 The German Federal Central Tax Office maintains a database of virtually all residents in Ger­ many who have been assigned a ax ID (Steuer-ID). This database includes, in addition o personal identifiers, curren or las known addresses. In cooperation with other governmen agencies and commercial banks, bank details or a valid IBAN are being assigned o all individuals registered he database. Cf.

Box Reducing he climate dividend for median income households as a par of wage and income axes1 As an income concep for reducing he climate dividend, we sugges he ne income per person in he household, as long as i has been included in he wage and income ax base. This makes i possible o use a standardized reduction function ha does no have o be differentiated by household or family ype. Ne income per person can be sufficiently",
      "accurately derived from income ax return or wage ax information (Figure). We sugges he following reduction function: • Based on median needs-weighted ne household income (me­ dian income): With he commonly used needs-scale (new OECD scale), his is estimated o be 30,000 euros per year per person in 2024, so 2,500 euros/month (SOEP 2020, extrapolated o 2024). • The climate dividend is reduced linearly over a surrounding income interval of 10,000 euros relative o annual income, i.e., from 25,000 euros o 35,000 euros per year.2 This way, he climate dividend will be significantly reduced for he median income groups: The bo om 30 percen of he population will receive nearly he entire dividend, while i will be almos com­ pletely reduced for he op 30 percen (Figure 3). The additional bureaucratic effor required o reduce he dividend is minimal. Taxpayers do no need o provide any additional infor­ mation as only existing information from he axation procedure is required. Implementation requires moderate one-off expenses esti­ mated a 250 million euros for he ax authorities and employers in the contex of wage ax procedures.3 1 For more, see Footnote 6 of Bach e al., “Ausgestaltung einer Klimaprämie in Deutschland.” 2 Reducing he climate dividend over a wide income interval avoids he “fall-back effect” of a fixed income limi and keeps he ransfer reduction rate of he reduction low. For example, for a climate dividend of 150 euros per year, his means a marginal burden on ne income of 1.5 percen within he ax reduction interval. The marginal burden on gross income (i.e., before deduction of social security contributions and wage/income ax) increases by 0.8 o 0.9 percentage points. 3 These costs are incurred for he echnical adjustmen of he axation procedures and he dis­ closure of he burden in ax assessments and payslips, as well as for increased communication costs following he introduction of he climate dividend. To avoid legal objections o axing or reducing he climate divi­ dend as a par of income axation as well as effects on he federal fiscal equalization, he ax authorities could carry ou he proposed procedures on behalf of he federal government. The additional revenue would hen flow in full o he federal government, if nec­ essary minus a reimbursemen of administrative costs o he im­ plementing ax authorities. This is unlike he case with income ax, where half of he additional revenue is paid o he federal states and municipalities.

Limi he dividend o low and middle-income earners A flat-rate per capita climate dividend for all residents would also relieve above-average and high-income earners. However, carbon pricing burdens hese groups relative o their income considerably less and hey generally have more opportunities for reducing heir fossil energy consumption— opportunities ha are generously supported by subsidy pro­ grams, which mostly have a strong regressive effect. 6 The study was conducted on behalf of he Federal Environmen Agency (Umweltbundesamt, UBA).

The responsibility for he conten of he study lies with he authors. Therefore, i seems reasonable o concentrate he climate dividend on low and middle-income households and indi­ viduals. The funds saved by doing so can be used in a more targeted manner o relieve groups with above-average bur­ dens or hose experiencing particular hardship. Furthermore, according o European legal requirements, revenue from he EU-ETS2 may only be used for programs aimed a decreas­ ing fossil energy consumption or leveling social disparities between low and middle-income households and higher-in­ come households beginning in 2027.

This ensures ha low-income households receive he full climate dividend, while i is reduced for high-income households. This indirec adjustmen based on income can be integrated easily into existing axation procedures with­ ou excessive bureaucracy. Carbon pricing burdens poorer households more relative o household income The revenue effects of carbon pricing as well as he relief for households are estimated based on curren forecasts on energy consumption and overall economic developmen in 2024.8 We use a microsimulation model ha is based on Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) household data from 2020 o analyze he distributional effects. The data is coordinated with the macroeconomic information systems and extrapolated o the year 2024.9 The simulations assume ha he carbon price is fully shifted o he final consumption prices of fuels and heating fuels. The effects of he European Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS1) are no observed. Economic effects of he reform scenarios investigated, especially energy consump­ tion savings, are no considered in he simulation calcula­ tions. The carbon cos allocation for heating rented build­ ings, which divides he heating costs between landlords and tenants according o a graduated model, is also no aken into account.10 The following is based on a carbon price of 65 euros per ton, which is he upper price limi in 2026 under he exist­ ing regulations. Based on he estimated energy consump­ tion for 2024, revenue from he German national ETS will total 18.3 billion euros (Table), no including an additional 1.9 billion euros in VAT revenue.11 Corporate ax revenue fell by 1.6 billion euros, as he scenarios considered here do no provide any relief for firms; hus, higher energy prices ployees earning minimum wage due o he rapid increase in he marginal ax rate for low-income earners. The dividend would be axed a a maximum of 42 percen (44.3 percen including he solidarity surcharge) for above-average and high-income earners in he op income deciles and a 45 percen (47.5 percen including",
      "he solidarity surcharge) for very high-income households (278,000 euros axable income or more per year). This means ha even op earners and he super rich may keep up o over half of he climate dividend. 8 We use data from he Energiebilanz, environmental-economic accounting (Umweltökonomi- sche Gesamtrechnungen, UGR), energy ax statistics up o 2022, he official May 2024 ax estimate on energy and electricity axes until 2028, der national accounts up o 2023, and he Spring 2024 Join Economic Forecast. 9 We use data from he 2020 SOEP survey wave (v37), in which detailed information on energy consumption was collected. For more on he methods, see Stefan Bach and Jakob Knautz, “Hohe Energiepreise: Ärmere Haushalte werden rotz Entlastungspaketen stärker belaste als reichere Haushalte,” DIW Wochenberich no. 17 (2022) (in German; available online); Isabel Schrems e al., “Wirkung des nationalen Brennstoffemissionshandels – Auswertungen und Analysen.

The simulations reveal he familiar picture of a regressive carbon pricing impac on motor and heating fuels. There is a considerably greater burden on low-income households relative o heir income han on high-income households. For heating fuels (heating oil, natural gas, and liquefied gas), the regressive effec of carbon pricing is significant, while i is much smaller for premium grade gas and nearly pro­ portional for diesel. These distributional effects will become accordingly stronger if he carbon price reaches levels of 100+ euros per on from 2027 in he EU-ETS2. The actual distributional effects may be even more severe, as poorer households frequently have fewer opportunities o reac o high energy prices. In con­ trast, rich households are increasingly performing energy-ef­ ficien refurbishmen on heir homes, installing new heat­ ing systems, or purchasing electric vehicles. Flat-rate per capita climate dividend relieves low- income earners The simulations firs accoun for he coverage of higher heat­ ing costs due o carbon pricing as a par of he basic income scheme as well as he carbon and climate components of he 2021 and 2023 housing benefi reforms as relief for house­ holds.14 To do so, we use a micro simulation model o esti­ mate a relief volume of 1.0 billion euros in 2024. The remain­ ing governmen revenue from carbon pricing ha is availa­ ble for compensation declines accordingly. As additional relief, we simulate a flat-rate per capita climate dividend ha is paid o all residents in Germany. We assume tha he amoun of he climate dividend is calculated based on carbon pricing revenue from households, excluding VAT revenue, which is estimated o be 10.4 billion euros (Table). With 84 million residents, his results in a climate dividend of 124.09 euros per person per year. To avoid double subsidies, coverage of high heating costs via the basic income scheme and he increase in he housing benefi are offse agains he climate dividend. This results in ne costs of 9.5 billion euros for he dividend, which reduces the general governmen financial balance o 7.2 billion euros.

A climate dividend of 124.09 euros per person per year as well as he coverage of heating costs and increase in he hous­ ing benefi almos completely offse he carbon pricing bur­ den, including VAT, on average, for households as a whole (Figure 1). The climate dividend counteracts and reverses the regressive burden of carbon pricing. Low-income earn­ ers benefi from his considerably on average, as he flat-rate climate dividend is much higher relative o heir income than for above-average or high-income earners. In addition, many low-income earners have heir heating costs covered by the basic income scheme and he housing benefi has been increased, which is partially offse agains he climate div­ idend here. The increase in he housing benefi will make itself more noticeable in he second and hird deciles, as he housing benefi mainly favors “top-ups” (low-income indi­ viduals also receiving he citizen’s benefit) and extends into the lower middle classes. On balance, i.e., aking into accoun he carbon pricing bur­ den and he relief provided by he climate dividend and social benefits, households in he lowes decile will be relieved by jus under 0.6 percen of heir ne income on average. The relief and burdens balance each other ou for middle-in­ come earners, while he op 30 percen of households have a marginal burden of nearly 0.2 percen of heir ne income. Overall, he combination of carbon pricing and a flat-rate dividend reduce income inequality slightly.

Behr, Till Köveker, and Merve Kücük ABSTRACT In 2023, heating energy prices increased by substantial 31 percen compared o he previous year, following a 33 per­ cen increase already seen in 2022. Calculations based on data from he energy service provider ista show average price increases were he highes in he German state of Rhine­ land-Palatinate, and he lowes in Hamburg. Owing o hese price hikes and ongoing energy-saving efforts, he empera­ ture-adjusted heating energy consumption of wo- and mul­ ti-apartmen buildings in Germany covered in his study fell by an average of four percen compared o he previous year, which was slightly less han he decline observed in 2022. The bigges energy savings were seen in households in Saxony. A he same ime, emperature-adjusted CO2 emissions per square meter also fell, although o a slightly lesser exten han in 2022. With heating energy prices stabilizing, he momentum in emissions reductions is expected o slow down. If Germany is o mee its climate argets, further efforts are needed, par­ ticularly in improving energy efficiency in he building sector and in switching o renewable heating systems. The impac of he gas price crisis continued o be fel strongly in 2023. Since Gazprom began restricting gas supply in he second half of 2021, and all he more so after Russia launched its a ack on Ukraine in February 2022, gas and other heating fuels have become significantly more expensive in Germany. After dramatic price hikes in he firs year of he war, prices continued heir steep upward rend over he course of 2023. In both 2022 and 2023, as a response o a looming gas short­ age and he ever-increasing burden on private households, the German governmen ook various measures in an a emp to reduce energy consumption while simultaneously allevi­ ating he burden on private households. In December 2022, for instance, households’ monthly heating bill for gas and distric heating was paid by he government.1 In January 2023, a gas and heating price cap was introduced o be appli­ cable for private households and small and medium-sized enterprises. For natural gas consumers, he cap was se a 12 cents per kilowa -hour (kWh). This price was applied o 80 percen of he projected annual heating energy consump­ tion in September 2022.2 Any consumption beyond ha had to be paid a he regular marke price. Similarly, for house­ holds using distric heating, heating costs were capped a 9.5 cents per kWh. The relief granted by he state had o be clearly indicated on he heating bill. The aim of his instru­ men was o maintain he incentive o",
      "reduce heating energy consumption hrough higher energy prices while simultane­ ously protecting consumers from overly high prices.3 This measure came into force on March 1, 2023 (and also ret­ roactively included January and February) and expired on December 31, 2023. 1 Bundesregierung, “Energie-Raba für Haushalte und Unternehmen,” 2023 (in German; availa- ble online, accessed October 14, 2024; his applies o all other online sources in his repor unless stated otherwise). 2 If a household reduces its heating energy consumption by more han 20 percen in compar­ ison o he previous year, he annual statemen will show hese entire savings reimbursed a he new, higher energy price, meaning ha he greater incentives created by he new higher prices apply o he entirety of saving. 3 The gas and heating price cap applied o private households, small and medium-sized enter­ prises with a gas consumption of less han 1.5 million kilowa -hours per year, as well as clubs and associations. Cf.

The goal was o further reduce Europe’s dependence on (Russian) gas imports, on he one hand, and mee he climate argets outlined in he Paris Agreement, on he other. In 2022 and 2023, emissions from he German building sector otaled 108 and 102 million onnes of CO2 equivalent, respectively,4 which is considerably higher 4 To be able o compare he impac of differen climate-active gases, hey are converted into CO2 equivalents.

Box 1 Database und methodology used for Hea Monitor 2023 In partnership with ista SE (former ista Deutsschland GmbH), one of he larges energy service providers in Germany, he DIW Berlin has developed he Hea Monitor Germany in 2014. The Monitor re­ ports regional and national rends in heating energy consumption, energy prices and heating expenditures for residential buildings on an annual basis. The calculations are based on (1) building-level heating bills from ista SE for abou 300000 residential buildings with wo or more apartments (more han wo million apartments), (2) climate adjustmen factors from he German Weather Service (Deutscher We erdienst), and (3) census survey results from he German Federal Statistical Office. The heating bills contain infor­ mation on energy consumption, billing periods, heating fuel ype, energy costs, and building location and size. The heating bills capture residential buildings with wo or multi apartments – i.e., he sample covers buildings, owned or rented, with a leas wo households. We further limi he sample of build­ ings o hose with heated living space of between 15 and 250 square meters per apartment. Note ha we do no have a random sample from he population of residential buildings in Germany. In comparison with he 2014 microcensus supplementary survey,",
      "buildings with hree o six apartments and larger buildings (13 or more apartments) are overrepresented in he sample. We offse this by weighting average heating consumption according o he relative importance of each building size category in he statistical population. To accomplish his, we use results from he 2010 mi­ crocensus supplementary survey ha indicate he shares of each building size category by spatial planning region (ROR). For each building, we calculate he emperature-adjusted heat­ ing energy consumption by adjusting otal energy consumed for heating for local changes in he climate and weather. To ensure comparability across ime and space, we use information from he German Weather Service. The available weighting factors normal­ izes heating consumption o climatic condition in Potsdam, he reference location.1 We calculate he annual quantity of heating energy consumption in relation o he heated living space of a building. This is carried ou in several steps: First, building-specific consumption values are 1 The effec of differen emperature correction methods was determined in a study from 2022. The study shows ha he results of he emperature-corrected values do no differ greatly. See Pe­ ter Mellwig e al., “Klimaschutz im Gebäudebereich: Erklärungen für stagnierende CO2-Emissionen trotz erfolgreicher Sanierungsmaßnahmen,” Shor study commissioned by Agora Energiewende 2022 (in German; available online). limited o he amounts of energy used for heating space (excluding warm water). Second, he consumption value is multiplied by he heating value corresponding o he building’s energy fuel ype, giv­ ing us he absolute heating energy consumption in kilowa -hours (kWh) for a building in a billing period. Third, he values are allocat­ ed o a specific heating year, since he closing date for measure­ men is no always December 31 of he relevan year. Fourth, we adjus he consumption values for he climatic conditions during the heating period in question and divide i by he amoun of heat­ ing space in he building. The units are kilowa -hours required per square meter of heated living space per year (kWh/sqm). Lastly, average heating demand values a he regional level are computed as he weighted arithmetic mean for he overall building stock of a region – for weights, we use he proportion of buildings in each housing size category (two, hree o six, seven o welve, 13 to 20, and over 21 apartments) a he regional level. Heating bills are created with a ime lag. The values of he 2021 heating period are calculated based on a smaller sample han he values for earlier years. For 2023, around 50 percen of he homes are available, compared o 2022. The results for 2023 should therefore be regarded as preliminary. For heating consumption, a correction was made by calculating a hypothetical value for 2023 energy consumption and by correcting he energy consumption for 2022 with he national rend. I is possible, however, ha an update may nevertheless resul in retroactive corrections. To calculate he price and consumption changes in he differen regions, he prices for one kilowa hour of heating energy",
      "and he temperature-adjusted heating energy requirements per square meter in 2023 are compared with hose from 2022. As he con­ tracts of households do no reflec he wholesale price, bu usually a price fixed for one or wo years is paid, he energy prices in 2023 differed greatly depending on when he new contrac was concluded and wha he energy cos level was a he ime. Energy prices also differ significantly from region o region. For hese reasons, only he energy prices and requirements of buildings for which data is available in both 2022 and 2023 are compared. Buildings ha appear in he data se for 2022 bu for which no data is currently available for 2023 are no included in his analysis. Therefore, he changes in prices and requirements per federal state or region shown in Figures 3 and 4 and in he ex canno be directly compared with he figures in he able, which are based on all buildings available for he respective year. 266 DIW Weekly Repor 45/2024 HEAT MONITOR 2023 than he 67 million onnes of CO2 equivalen specified in Germany’s climate action argets for 2030.5 DIW Berlin’s Hea Monitor Germany analyzes heating energy consumption, energy prices, and heating expendi­ tures as well as he resulting CO2 emissions for residential buildings on an annual basis. The calculations are based on heating energy bills for wo- and multi-apartmen build­ ings. The comprehensive dataset, which comprises around 300,000 buildings and was provided by energy service pro­ vider ista SE (formerly ista Deutschland GmbH)6, is weighted on he basis of he German microcensus, and herefore paints a representative picture for he whole of Germany. Our analysis for 2023 is based on energy bill data already available for over 170,000 buildings (Box 1). This year’s analysis focuses on he continued savings in heat­ ing energy consumption as well as he developmen of heat­ ing costs and prices in he firs year after he beginning of he energy price crisis.

In 2017, he wo companies combined held a marke share of around 50 percent. only, was extended his year o include distric heating. The increasing share of distric heating, which currently accounts for around 15 percen of homes in Germany, is hus aken into accoun as a potentially sustainable hea source in he hea supply.7 Consequently, he average prices for 2023 and the historical comparison years listed in his repor now also include distric heating. Heating energy consumption remains higher in the wes han in he eas and south of Germany Heating energy consumption8 in wo- and multi-apartmen buildings continued o fall in 2023 (Figure 1). In fact, he aver­ age",
      "emperature-adjusted heating consumption of 118 kWh per square meter of heated living space was 3.8 percen lower than in he previous year (123 kWh) and nine percen lower than in 2021 (130 kWh). The combination of higher heating energy prices, alongside appeals o save energy during he 2022/2023 heating period, and argeted measures o reduce heating energy consumption (such as hydraulic balancing, additional energy efficiency measures, heating curve adjust­ ments) had a noticeable impac on he heating energy con­ sumption in 2023. However, he increase in prices could no be offse by he savings in demand, resulting in higher expenditures for households. We observe significan regional differences in heating energy consumption, specifically between he wes and northwes of Germany, on he one hand, and he eas and south, on the other. Once again, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania consumed he leas heating energy a 99 kWh per square meter. As in he previous year, Saarland was a he other end of he scale with he highes consumption of 137 kWh per square meter (Table and Figure 2). Taken ogether, he western German states consumed 121 kWh per square meter, exceeding he heating energy consumption of heir east­ ern German counterparts, which required an average of 111 kWh (Figure 1). A possible explanation for his could be the higher retrofi rates for residential buildings in he east­ ern German states.9 A he regional level, he differences between he highes and lowes level of consumption are even more pronounced. Central Mecklenburg/Rostock had he lowes average heating energy consumption in Germany a 87 kWh per square meter, followed by Western Pomerania a 98 kWh. Eas Fresia, in contrast, consumed far more heating energy with 140 kWh per square meter. The Saar region was in second place with 137 kWh. 7 This corresponds o around six percen of residential buildings in Germany, cf. BDEW (2024): Wie heiz Deutschland 2023?

      "meter The median heating energy price for 2023, accounting for rebates granted under he energy price cap, was 11.81 cents per kWh. In 2023, Germany saw a 31.4 percen increase over the previous year, which was almos as high as he increase in he firs year after he star of he war on Ukraine, when energy prices rose by 33.3 percen (Figure 3). This corre­ sponds o a 75-percen increase in average prices compared to 2021. There are several reasons for his sharp increase in energy prices despite he price cap. First, he cap applied o gas and distric heating only;10 second; he average prices for 2022 were far lower han he price cap; and hird, he price cap applied only o 80 percen of pas consumption. If a house­ hold was only able o reduce its consumption by less han 20 percen compared o 2022 and he new contractual price would have been higher han he level of he price cap, he resulting average price for his household would exceed he price cap. Arguably he main reason why heating energy prices con­ tinued o increase in 2023, as compared o 2022, was ha 10 In 2023, here was also an electricity price cap. However, his only impacted heating energy prices for a very small number of households, as only a very small proportion of buildings in Germany have electric heating. Since he presen analysis is limited o he hree dominan heat­ ing energy sources—gas, oil, and distric heating—the electricity price cap has no effec for he sample considered. Another area where we observe stark differences between German states is in he billed heating prices (Table). Median heating prices were he lowes in Bremen with 11.08 cents per kWh, followed by Baden-Wür emberg with 11.15 cents. In contrast, Berlin and Brandenburg had he highes heat­ ing prices with median prices of 12.87 and 12.80 cents per kWh, respectively. Regional differences a he more granular level were even more pronounced.

Median heating prices in Altmark, Saxony-Anhalt, were lowes a jus 8.84 cents per kWh, followed by Bodensee- Oberschwaben a 9.03 cents. Box 2 Calculation of CO₂ emissions To calculate a building’s CO2 emissions, he heating energy consumption per square meter is multiplied by he emis­ sion factors of each energy carrier (Table). To allow for a comparison with emissions in he building sector for he whole of Germany, only direc CO2 emissions are calculated. Upstream emissions resulting from energy extraction, rans­ port, and ransformation (for example when generating elec­ tricity and distric heating) are no aken into account. To calculate representative average annual CO₂ emissions per square meter, he annual CO2 emissions per square meter are weighted for each property according o he share of he building category in he statistical population. The weighting is similar o he calculation for emperature-adjusted heating energy consumption (Box 1). In other words, he",
      "differen build­ ing size categories are weighted according o heir share in the microcensus.

Thanks o he one o wo-year energy price plans signed up for in advance, hey were no subjec o price increases in 2022. The differen contrac structures therefore resulted in a significan increase in price variation. Accordingly, here are households ha came hrough he crisis almos unscathed, while others ended up paying very high prices. A he federal state level, Rhineland-Palatinate saw he bigges price increase with 45.2 percent, while he state of Hamburg recorded he smalles increase with jus 8.8 percen in comparison o he previous year. The bigges energy savings in 2023 were recorded in Saxony, which reduced heir heating energy consumption by 5.8 per­ cent. Saarland and Brandenburg, in contrast, saw he small­ es reductions in consumption (2.6 and 2.8 percent, respec­ tively). One of he reasons households did no save more, despite he steep price increases, was likely he energy effi­ ciency of he buildings, something over which particularly tenan households generally have no influence. Hence, he relation between price increases and reduced heating energy consumption is no clear (Figure 4). The fac ha reduced consumption canno fully offse hese sharp price increases is also reflected in he steep rise in overall heating expendi­ tures, with 2023 seeing an increase in heating energy expend­ iture of around 24 percen over he previous year (compared to 2021, he las year before he energy crisis, he increase was as high as 54 percent). Price and demand structure for distric heating differs noticeably from gas and oil Distric heating and hea networks have he potential o make a significan contribution o he decarbonization of hea supply: They can be operated with sustainable energy sources and are more efficien han building-internal gas and oil-based heating systems. In order o map he poten­ tial switch o sustainable sources in hea generation, his year for he firs ime he Hea Monitor’s analysis of heat­ ing energy prices covers no jus oil and gas bu also distric heating. The analysis clearly shows ha he price range for distric heating is considerably wider han for gas and oil (Figure 5). Similarly, he median price of distric heating per kilowa -hour",
      "is, on average, substantially higher han those for gas and oil. Tha said, a 97 kWh per square meter, heating consumption for distric heating is 24 percen lower han for oil (127 kWh) and 19 percen lower han for gas (120 kWh) (Figure 6). Differences in price and demand for distric heating arise, among other reasons, from he fac ha hea is supplied directly with distric heating, whereas with gas and heat­ ing oil, here are conversion losses due o hea generation in he house. Another reason for he lower average heating energy consumption for distric heating is ha buildings sup­ plied with distric heating have, on average, more residential units han buildings, which are heated with gas or oil. These larger buildings have less outer walls per square meter of liv­ ing space, resulting in lower heating energy requirements.

To calculate he changes, only buildings ha could be observed in both 2022 and 2023 are aken into accoun and weighted using he microcensus. For his reason, his figure is no comparable with he able. Source: ista SE; authors’ own calculations. © DIW Berlin 2024 Savings in consumption were no necessarily related o price increases: Households in Saxony saved he mos on heating energy, even hough prices did no rise ha much here in 2023. 272 DIW Weekly Repor 45/2024 HEAT MONITOR 2023 Emissions reductions losing momentum Las year, building sector emissions in Germany amounted to 102 million onnes of CO2 equivalent.11 This is 51 percen less han in 1990. Nevertheless, for Germany o mee its 2030 climate argets, he building sector has o reduce its emis­ sions by 69 percen compared o 1990 levels. A building’s CO2 emissions depend on multiple factors (Box 2), in particular its energy efficiency and he heating system used. The emissions per square meter for he wo- and multi-apartmen buildings examined here continue o be on a downward rend (Figure 7). With 19.1 kilos per square meter of heated living space, he CO2 emissions a ributed o heating were eigh percen lower in 2023 han in he previ­ ous year. Temperature-adjusted, however, his corresponds to a 4.3 percen reduction only, as 2023 was a relatively mild year. Thus, although he downward rend has continued, he reduction in emissions was lower in 2023 han he 5.6 per­ cen observed in he previous year (16 percen withou em­ perature adjustment). Given he smaller decrease in heating energy consumption, i is no surprising ha emissions lev­ els are no longer falling as dramatically, bu he momentum in he building sector is still no enough o mee Germany’s climate argets. Conclusion: Greater investmen in building energy efficiency needed In 2023, once again, households faced strong increases in heating costs compared o he previous year—amounting o 31 percent, on average. Tha being said,",
      "here were strong regional variations. These resulted, on he one hand, from the differen ypes of fuel used, as well as from he differ­ en ypes of contracts used by electricity and gas suppliers. Other importan factors migh be he differen points in time a which contracts were concluded or oil anks filled. The analysis shows hat, in 2023, he (now expired) energy price cap o protec households from potentially extreme heating cos hikes was indeed effective. For he majority of households, he uni prices billed were no substantially higher han he price cap of 12 cents. When i came o dis­ tric heating, on he other hand, he average price of heat­ ing energy was 13 cents per kWh—well above he price cap of 9.5 cents per kWh. With he price cap only applying o 80 percen of forecasted consumption and anything above this being charged a given marke energy prices, 2023 saw a very high average price for distric heating in many places. Despite similar price increases as in 2022, heating energy savings in 2023 were lower han in he previous year. Temperature-adjusted, private households consumed 3.8 per­ cen less heating energy han in 2022. In he previous year, the saving was 5.3 percent. One reason for his migh be ha 11 Umweltbundesamt, “Treibhausgasminderungsziele Deutschlands,” 2024 (in German; available online).

Another reason migh be ha he poten­ tial o save energy hrough changes in consumer behavior had already been exhausted in some households. In some regions, however, savings were more han wice as high as the national average. This indicates ha savings in heating energy and herefore also emissions are still possible in he shor erm – whether hrough behavioral adjustments or energy-efficien renovations. The months following he energy price crisis of 2022/2023 saw he price pressure on he supply side decrease as whole­ sale energy prices dropped and started o stabilize. In he years ahead, however, he cos of CO2 emissions from fos­ sil fuels is likely o increase heating costs for private house­ holds. Tha said, he energy price crisis has demonstrated tha higher heating costs have a limited impac on people’s heating behavior and herefore also CO2 emissions. When i comes o reducing",
      "emissions, he momentum is thus unlikely o continue unless i is supported by other means. Yet, emissions have o be reduced for he climate ar­ gets in he building sector o be met. The Exper Commission on Gas and Hea has proposed a number of specific meas­ ures o achieve hese reductions. The advice and in-kind contributions intended o help households reduce heir heating energy and electricity consumption should here­ fore be strengthened. Even more importantly, however, he energy-efficien retrofits of inefficien buildings as well as he switch o sustainable heating systems such as hea pumps mus be accelerated. If his is no vigorously pursued, we can expec ha heating energy consumption and hus also emissions in he building sector will rise again in he com­ ing years.

In 2023, around 72 billion euros were spen on the energy-efficien renovation of residential, public, and com­ mercial buildings, abou 12 billion more han in 2021. Never­ theless, investments declined by over six percen in price-ad­ justed erms, as construction prices rose sharply during his time as well. To reach climate argets, however, significantly more real investments in energy-efficien building renova­ tion are needed, as are framework conditions in Germany and Europe. Investmen aid for energy-efficien renovation measures also plays an importan role. The German Federal Governmen increased funding for hese measures for 2024 o 16.7 billion euros. However, policymakers will need o provide even more funding in he future due o rising financing and construction costs if hey actually wan o increase he rate of energy-efficien building renovation. In its mos recen report, he Council of Experts on Climate Change warned ha much more progress needs o happen in he building sector han has occurred o date o reach he greenhouse gas reduction argets in Germany.1 Reducing heating energy consumption in he building stock is one way o significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. For over a decade, here have been calls o improve he energy condition of he building stock by increasing building enve­ lope insulation (walls, windows, roof) and installing more efficien heating systems.2 Energy-efficien renovation is difficul o measure, bu here are suitable indicators I is difficul o evaluate he exten o which energy-efficien renovation measures have actually improved he energy con­ dition of he building stock over he pas years. Detailed stud­ ies on his opic are extremely complex and only available for specific years.3 Studies based on smaller samples can only determine rough rends in he developmen of energy-effi­ cien building renovation over a few years. Moreover, hey are limited o he existing residential building stock. According to he available data, he annual energy-efficien renovation rate, which is he share of a building’s surface area ha has undergone energy-efficien renovation in a certain year, has hardly changed since 2000 and is estimated o be less han one percen for 2017.4 An alternative approach for measuring energy-efficien ren­ ovation is based on he amoun of money invested in his type of renovation instead of focusing on physical indicators. 1 Exper Council on Climate Change, Review of Projection Data: Compliance with climate arge for 2021 o 2030 no confirmed.

However, i is no possible o determine he specific additional amoun spen on improving energy efficiency ha results, for exam­ ple, from installing a riple-glazed window compared o a double-glazed one. Nevertheless, i is possible o determine Box Determining investments in energy-efficien building renovation Investments in energy-efficien building renovation are estimat­ ed by combining aggregate statistical official evaluations from the DIW Construction Volume ha have been broken down with extrapolated survey results from he construction service pro­ vider Heinze GmbH’s Modernization Volume (Figure). The DIW Construction Volume contains he otal of all services ha are involved in he construction or maintenance of buildings and structures. In his respect, he Construction Volume goes beyond the construction investmen figures of he Federal Statistical Office because heir figures do no ake into accoun consumable con­ struction services, which are primarily repairs ha do no increase in value (i.e., maintenance services provided by he main construc­ tion and finishing rades). Unlike in he official statistics, he DIW Construction Volume differentiates between construction services on he existing building stock and on new buildings. Existing measures, or rather he volume of existing construction measures, are estimated from a macro perspective by looking a the differences between otal construction outpu according o construction statistics and new construction outpu derived from construction activity statistics.1 This has he advantage of allowing consisten comparisons over ime. However, he model calcula­ tions using he difference approach lack structural information. To identify such structural information, he results from he model calculations based on official statistics are considered. These are then compared with extrapolations of modernization volumes based on surveys. The extrapolation results are based on spe­ cial analyses on he years 2014, 2018, 2020, and 2022 by Heinze GmbH.2 In Heinze GmbH’s studies, he modernization volume is calculated by linking secondary statistical marke data with survey results from arge groups relevan o he modernization market. The main source of housing marke data is a survey of representatively selected enan and owner households. In addition, commercial housing developers are surveyed. The results for non-residen­ tial construction are based on evaluations of questionnaires on modernization measures run by architects. In addition, surveys of tradespeople are used. Using hese sources, he existing meas­ ures can be differentiated by sector.

Structural information on he importance of he above sectors from a micro approach is consistently integrated into DIW construction volume calculation. A prerequisite for his is ha he results of the wo methods correspond with each other. This applies o he quantitative otal resul as well as he specific definition of con­ struction services. Thus, investmen construction services are he focus of he Heinze GmbH survey results. Due o its connection o the architec survey, his applies o non-residential construction especially. In he case of residential construction, on he other hand, work performed by he occupant, including neighborhood assistance and undeclared work, is no valued, unlike in he Construction Volume. The structural information gleaned from he Heinze GmbH surveys is herefore no directly related o he Construction Volume as a whole, bu only o he investmen part. A model calculation o sep­ arate construction services into investmen and non-investmen measures is required o integrate he values from he structural information from Heinze. For his purpose, DIW Berlin specifically evaluated he structural information on repair measures from he Heinze surveys and made corresponding extrapolations for he average maintenance measures. The measures were differentiated over ime by linking hem o he developmen of gross fixed assets in structural engineering, for which DIW Berlin developed special model calculations.3 3 Susanne Hotze et al., “Struktur der Bestandsinvestitionen 2014.

The Federal Institute for Research on Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial Developmen (Bundesinstitu für Bau-, Stadt- und Raumforschung, BBSR6) and he Federal Environmen Agency (Umweltbundesamt, UBA7) regularly publish hese results, which are based on he DIW Construction Volume and he Heinze Modernization Volume, on he investmen",
      "volume in he energy-efficien renovation of residential and non-residential buildings. Furthermore, his Weekly Repor presents a differentiated eval­ uation of hree energy-efficien renovation sectors: roof/wall insulation, window/door replacements, and heating/air con­ ditioning system renewal.8 In addition, he real developmen of investments in energy-efficien renovation are presented here o accoun for he strong price increases of recen years. A mix of price indicators are used o measure deflation, as the official price statistics do no directly reflec he individual energy-efficien renovation sectors. Roof/wall insulation, win­ dows/doors, and heating/air conditioning are hus assigned o price indices for suitable produc areas and economic classes. Roof/wall insulation stagnating following growth A significan share of expenditure on energy-efficien ren­ ovation is spen on improving he insulation of he build­ ing envelope. A curren prices, over 16 billion euros were invested in insulating roofs, basemen ceilings, and facades of residential buildings in 2023. Once again, roughly six bil­ lion euros were spen on insulating commercial and public non-residential buildings (Figure 1). The nominal amoun invested in insulation, especially of residential buildings, increased significantly over he pas years. For example, he amoun invested in he insulation of residential facades and roofs in 2023 was nearly wice as high as in 2018. However, when considering he enormous price increases since 2021, he real value of investments in the insulation of residential buildings did no increase in 2022 or 2023. 5 Institu der deutschen Wirtschaft, Energetische Modernisierung des Gebäudebestandes: Her­ ausforderungen für private Eigentümer.

Spending on building insula­ tion in he commercial and public sectors rose again from 2019. However, only in 2020 were he nominal increases sufficien enough o reach he real investmen level of 2013. Investments in he insulation of non-residential buildings, in contrast, were only around 80 percen of he initial level in 2024. Window and exterior door replacements rending downward The amoun spen on window and exterior door replacements in residential buildings has barely changed over many years (Figure 2). For example, around 13.5 billion euros were spen on window and exterior door replacements from 2017 o 2020. Only recently has spending increased noticeably. However, the nominal increases were considerably lower han he high price increases due o he extremely high costs of glass production. Accordingly, real investments in window/exte­ rior door replacements in he pas hree years have declined sharply: In 2023, he real investmen level was nearly 25 per­ cen lower han i was in 2013. In price-adjusted erms, investments in he replacemen of windows and exterior doors of commercial and public non-residential buildings declined even more markedly dur­ ing he observation period. In 2023, real investments were 30 percen lower han in 2013. In nominal erms, abou five billion euros have been spen on window and exterior door replacements by commercial and public building owners in 2024. Renewed growth in heating system renewal since 2020 Compared o energy-efficien retrofi ing of building enve­ lopes via insulation or he replacemen of windows and exte­ rior doors, spending on heating system renewal has expe­ rienced stronger growth (Figure 3). Spending on heating system renewal in he residential housing stock has nearly doubled in nominal erms over he las 10 years. Although heating construction prices rose even more sharply han prices for energy-saving measures on he building enve­ lope, he increases in spending were enough o maintain a high level of real investments in he renewal of heating sys­ tems in residential buildings. I is assumed ha households are also investing in new gas heating systems before hey become subjec o stric regulations. However, investments narrowly missed reaching he peak value of real investments from 2017 in 2023. Investments in heating and air conditioning (AC) echnol­ ogy for non-residential buildings have been on an upward trend for many years. From 2011 o 2017, spending on heat­ ing and AC echnology increased from roughly six o nearly nine billion euros. Moreover, because he increase in spend­ ing outpaced price increases in his sector, real investments rose as well.

Due o he climb in energy prices since 2021, saving energy has increased in importance as a reason for modernizing owner-occupied or rented residential buildings (Figure 5).10 While only nine percen of investors cited energy savings as a reason for modernizing buildings in 2020, he figure had risen o 16 percen in 2022. The parallel sharp rise in financing costs and construction prices is likely why he change in reasons for modernizing has no been reflected in a real increase in investments in energy-efficien renovation of residential buildings. In addi­ tion, he survey on modernization reasons shows ha even in 2022, increasing comfor and maintaining value were still seen as more importan investmen reasons, with response rates of 23 percen and 20 percent, respectively. Energy-related renovation in commercial and public structural engineering continuing its downward slide Combining he results for investments in he individual sectors of energy-efficien public and commercial building renovation results in a concerning picture. In 2023, nearly 20 billion euros were spen on he energy-efficien renova­ tion of non-residential buildings, around 25 percen more than in 2013. However, as prices for construction work rose by over 50 percen during he same period, one quarter less is being invested in he energy-efficien renovation of pub­ lic and commercial buildings in real erms compared o 10 years ago (Figure 6). Investmen activity in energy-efficien renovation developed markedly worse han in other sectors of public and commer­ cial structural engineering. In particular, he construction of new buildings increased",
      "considerably. In 2023, investments in new construction were abou 25 percen higher han in 2013 in price-adjusted erms despite he curren weak phase. Measures other han energy-efficiency measures on existing buildings also suffered real losses. In price-adjusted erms, spending was 17 percen lower in 2023 compared o 2013. The decline was hus noticeably lower han in energy-efficien renovation. For many years, public and commercial investors were hesi­ tan o renovate buildings o improve energy efficiency, likely due o comparatively low oil and gas prices. In addition, he structural change in he non-residential housing stock is occurring more strongly in new construction han in residen­ tial construction. Currently, i should also be noted ha pub­ lic authorities in particular are ied o nominal investmen 9 Martin Gornig und Katrin Klarhöfer, “Investments in energy-efficien building renovation are on a downward slide,” DIW Weekly Repor no. 32/33 (2023): 225-232 (available online). 10 Katrin Klarhöfer, Christopher Kramp, and Christian Tiller, “Bestandsinvestitionen 2022.

Energy-efficien renovation of residential buildings losing momentum overall Overall, a bleak picture emerges when looking a investments in he energy-efficien renovation of residential buildings: Over he pas 10 years, annual spending on his ype of reno­ vation increased by more han 65 percen o nearly 53 billion euros. However, when considering price increases, real invest­ ments in 2023 were barely higher han in 2013 (Figure 4). The firs low poin of real investments in energy-efficien reno­ vation of residential buildings was in 2015 and was followed by a significan recovery in real investmen activity. I had reached its previous peak value in 2021, when he annual otal investmen amoun was abou eigh percen greater han he base year value. However, he considerable price increases in 2022 and 2023 almos canceled ou he real growth in invest­ ments entirely. Investments in he energy-efficien renovation of buildings thus developed markedly worse han in other areas of resi­ dential construction. Construction of new housing in particu­ lar experienced strong growth until 2020. Despite he curren weak phase, investments in new construction were around 11 percen higher in price-adjusted erms in 2023 han in 2013. Other measures on existing buildings, such as he moderniza­ tion of sanitary facilities or general maintenance, also resulted in real growth over he entire period. In price-adjusted erms, such spending was 15 percen higher in 2023 han in 2013.

Conclusion: Trend reversal in energy-efficien building renovation urgently needed There is no doub ha he energy efficiency of he building stock needs urgen improvement. In ligh of he weak real investmen activity in recen years, energy-efficien reno­ vation of he existing building stock mus be quadrupled. Binding minimum standards and renovation argets mus be se o reverse he rend in renovation activities.11 The long- term expected developmen of energy prices is a decisive fac­ tor for he willingness o inves in energy-efficien renovation. Political decisions on carbon pricing play a key role here irre­ spective of fluctuating raw materials prices. A reliably fore­ seeable path of further energy cos increases is essential for creating investmen incentives o reach he climate argets. Furthermore, here mus be appropriate funding conditions to achieve a noticeable increase in investments in he ener­ gy-efficien renovation of existing buildings. A he end of 2023, he German Federal Governmen reorganized he fund­ ing measures in he building sector as par of he Climate Action Program. The Federal Funding for Efficien Buildings program is he main approach o energy-efficien improve­ ments in he building stock.12 Since he beginning of 2024, the Kreditanstal für Wiederaufbau and he Federal Office of Economics and Expor Control (Bundesam für Wirtschaf und Ausfuhrkontrolle) have made newly structured funding pro­ grams available for he energy-efficien renovation of resi­ dential and non-residential buildings. The new focus of he funding programs has been accompa­ nied by a sharp increase in funding for energy-efficien ren­ ovation. Funds in he amoun of 16.7 billion euros for 2024 have been earmarked in he Klima- und Transformationsfonds for Federal Funding of Efficien Buildings.13 This represents an increase of almos 50 percen compared o he funding for 2023.14 Compared o he long-term average, he subsidies are 11 Sophie M.

The increase in nominal funding is offse by higher construction and financing costs in particu­ lar. Interes charges are likely o be almos hree imes higher compared o he end of he 2010s, even after he European Central Bank’s further interes rate cuts. Construction costs have risen by an average of more han 40 percen in he same period. If policymakers really wan o provide a strong impe­ tus for energy-efficien renovation activities in existing resi­ dential buildings, hey mus be prepared o inves significantly higher amounts",
      "of funding in he coming years. When designing he subsidy programs, care should be aken to ensure ha he approved measures can be implemented in a flexible manner.

Preliminary results from an ongoing research projec show ha he flee of ba ery-electric trucks as well as he number of models on offer have recently grown significantly, albei from a very low level. This is no he case for hydrogen rucks. Considerable amounts of invest­ men from he private sector are flowing into he charging infrastructure. Compared o hydrogen rucks, ba ery-electric vehicles have major advantages when i comes o energy efficiency, foreseeable energy costs, and heir expected and realistic contribution o climate change mitigation. Policymak­ ers should herefore se a clear focus on ramping up ba ery-­ electric rucks while expanding he charging infrastructure, he fas charging network more vigorously in particular. To face possible challenges, especially when i comes o grid connec­ tions, ba ery swapping systems, or overhead line systems— which have a large echnological overlap with ba ery-electric trucks—could be ested further. Furthermore, he energy efficiency advantages of ba ery-electric rucks should be con­ sidered in he greenhouse gas reduction quota system. Germany has se a goal o become climate neutral by 2045. This requires climate change mitigation measures in all eco­ nomic sectors, including road freigh ransport. One impor­ tan strategy for his sector is switching from diesel rucks to ba ery-electric or hydrogen rucks. This Weekly Repor provides an overview of he curren flee and marke developmen rends of ba ery-electric and hydro­ gen rucks as well as of he expansion of he charging and refueling infrastructure. Next, i discusses he advantages and drawbacks of alternative echnologies as well as heir possible contributions o climate change mitigation. The data used in his Weekly Repor are drawn from prelimi­ nary results of an ongoing research projec of he Institute for Energy and Environmental Research (Institu für Energie- und Umweltforschung Heidelberg, ifeu), TU Dresden, and DIW Berlin.1 Necessity of and options for climate change mitigation in road freigh ransport Road freigh ranges from urban distribution and delivery transpor via ligh commercial vehicles o rans-national heavy goods ransport. A variety of vehicles are used for such ransport, differing in aspects such as configuration and permi ed gross weight. Vehicles heavier han 3.5 tons are known as heavy-duty vehicles. The Federal Motor Transpor Authority (Kraftfahr Bundesamt, KBA) differen­ tiates between straigh rucks (Lastkraftwagen) and ractor units (Zugmaschinen). Especially relevan for heavy goods transpor is he subgroup of semi-trailer rucks.2 Semi-trailer trucks cover daily distances",
      "of 400 o 500 kilometers on aver­ age, much greater han other rucks (around 300 kilometers). 1 This Weekly Repor is based on wo recently published projec reports: Julia Pelzeter et al., Bewertung von Technologiekonfigurationen für den Straßengüterverkehr (ifeu, TU Dresden, DIW Berlin: 20224) (in German; available online. Accessed on October 28, 2024. This applies o all ­other online sources in his repor unless stated otherwise) as well as Julius Jöhrens et al., Komplementär­technologien zu BEV-Lkw – ein echno-ökonomischer Vergleich (ifeu, TU Dresden, DIW Berlin: 2024) (in German; available online). 2 Colloquially and also in his report, he erm “truck” is used in such a way ha i includes both trucks and ractor units as defined by official statistics. 289 DIW Weekly Repor 47+48/2024 ELECTRIC TRUCKS Road freigh causes significan greenhouse gas emissions in Germany, and he emissions keep rising. Commercial vehi­ cles weighing over 3.5 tons were responsible for 28 percen of emissions from he ranspor sector and for around six percen of otal German greenhouse gas emissions in 2022.3 Around wo hirds of hese commercial vehicles weighed over 26 tons; hey are mainly used for long-distance routes. Various alternative drive options Possible strategies for climate change mitigation in road freigh are avoiding ransport, switching o rail freight, and using alternative drives. There appears o be limited poten­ tial for avoiding ranspor and switching o rail freight.4 Thus, the focus is on switching from diesel rucks o ba ery-electric vehicles, which requires an expansion of he fast-charging infrastructure. There are also wo hydrogen-based options: Vehicles with hydrogen combustion engines and vehicles with fuel cells and an electric motor. Both ypes require hydrogen refueling stations. There has also been some discussion of retaining diesel engines while using biofuels or synthetic fuels based on green hydrogen (e-fuels). However, we do no investigate 3 Authors’ calculations based on he Transpor Emission Model (TREMOD), version 6.61 as well as data from he Federal Environmen Agency (Umweltbundesamt, UBA) (in German; available online). 4 Cf. The second section of he Spring Repor 2024: Sachverständigenra für Wirtschafts fragen, Güterverkehr zwischen Infrastrukturanforderungen und Dekarbonisierung (2024) (in German; available online). these options further in his Weekly Repor as hey do no appear o be affordably scalable.5 No echnology-specific goals o date The German Federal Government's Climate Action Programme 2030 stipulates ha around one hird of heavy road freigh ranspor mileage mus be electric or powered by electric fuels by 2030.6 Using alternative drives for road freigh hus poses an especially large opportunity for decar­ bonization.7 However, here are no concrete argets for newly registered rucks or he flee of electric rucks, unlike for elec­ tric passenger vehicles. In 2024, stricter flee argets for carbon emissions of newly registered heavy commercial vehicles were se a he European level.8 By 2030, newly registered rucks over 7.5 tons mus have 45 percen lower CO2 emissions compared o 2019. By 2035 and 2040, hey mus have 65 and 90 percen lower emissions, respectively, han in 2019.9 These argets 5 Wolf-Peter Schill, “E-Fuels:",

In addition, there are 236,000 semi-trailer rucks (Figure 1).11 Diesel engines dominate overwhelmingly in both sectors: 92 per­ cen of rucks and 97 percen of semi-trailer rucks have diesel engines. Only around 2.3 percen of rucks are pure ba ery- electric rucks; mos are ligh commercial vehicles weighing less han 3.5 tons. Only 0.3 percen of semi-trailer trucks are ba ery electric. However, he shares of new registrations of ba ery-electric vehicles are markedly higher (Figure 2). This has resulted in a considerable recen increase in he flee of ba ery-elec­ tric vehicles, albei from a low level.

Currently, here are around 400 pure ba ery-electric rucks for every hydrogen ruck in he fleet, while here are more than one hundred imes as many ba ery-electric semi-trailer trucks as hydrogen semi-trailer rucks. Further, here is no positive rend in new registrations of hydrogen vehicles. Considerable increase in number of electric vehicle models A wide variety of available models is importan for he marke potential of electric rucks due o factors such as route pro­ files, differing requirements in he logistics sector depending on he ype of good being ransported, and he often strong brand loyalty of ruck operators. 12 Among other hings, changes o he flee argets for newly registered rucks as well as o sub­ sidy programs accoun for outliers in individual months. A he federal level, for example, here was a subsidy financed by he Climate and Transformation Fund (Klima- und Transformations- fonds, KTF)) for he purchase of ba ery-electric or hydrogen commercial vehicles until 2023. This subsidy was ended withou a replacemen following he ruling of he Federal Constitutional Cour on November 15, 2023, and he subsequen budge consolidation. However, here are still individu­ al subsidy programs a he state level, cf. ifeu overview (in German; available online). In otal, 164 differen models in he sector of heavy rucks and semi-trailer rucks weighing over 3.5 tons could be iden­ tified on he German marke in October 2024 (Figure 3).13 One hundred and forty-one of hese models (86 percent) are already available and 23 have been announced (14 percent). Thus, compared o an earlier evaluation in October 2022 when 65 models were available, he number of models on offer has more han doubled. Around 80 percen of hese models are ba ery electric, while the remaining 20 percen have a fuel cell drive. Hydrogen vehicles are rather well represented in he model range com­ pared o heir curren niche role in existing and new vehicle registrations.14 However, a small number of specialis compa­ nies produce a large share of hydrogen rucks, and mos of them concentrate on converting vehicles from other manu­ facturers. Of he major manufacturers in Europe, in contrast, only six offer or have announced fuel cell vehicles (Figure 4). 13 A vehicle model is determined by eigh parameters: manufacturer, drive system, drive power, ba ery capacity, hydrogen ank capacity, fuel cell",
      "capacity, and number of axels. As here can be many differen configurations per model (for example, ba ery capacity or number of axels), only the greates ba ery capacity and he smalles number of axels are evaluated as separate models. 14 This also applies when compared o he significantly larger passenger vehicle market, in which only wo fuel cell models are currently available in Germany.

Mos fuel cell rucks are offered by retrofi ers. 292 DIW Weekly Repor 47+48/2024 ELECTRIC TRUCKS strategy,17 Daimler is pursuing a dual strategy with bat­ tery-electric drives and fuel cells o power heavy long-haul transport.18 Other manufacturers use a “three-pillar model” including renewable fuels (Volvo)19 or a “technology-neu­ tral multi-drive approach” (Iveco).20 Only Renaul Trucks will explicitly exclude fossil combustion engines from 2040 onward.21 Volvo, MAN, DAF, and Iveco also include he hydro­ gen combustion engine as an option o varying degrees. Information provided by manufacturers a “cleanroom dis­ cussions”,22 which have been initiated by he Federal Ministry for Digital and Transpor (Bundesministerium für Digitales und Verkehr, BMDV) o be er assess he future roll-ou of low-carbon rucks, shows ha he marke share of pure bat­ tery-electric drives in heavy commercial vehicles is expected to increase significantly in he coming years. By 2030, hey will make up around half of all sales in he over 12 tons weigh class. Various other echnologies will play more of a supplementary role. Ramp-up of charging and refueling infrastructure Ba ery-electric and hydrogen drives face differen challenges when i comes o heir public energy supply infrastructure. In many cases, ba ery-electric rucks can recharge he majority of heir ba ery a a depot, provided ha he grid connections and vehicle profiles allow it. However, a certain amoun of fas charging is required, especially in long-distance rans­ port.23 Hydrogen rucks, on he other hand, canno be refu­ eled in depots, bu are generally dependen on public hydro­ gen refueling stations, as he construction and operation of refueling stations is expensive compared o electric depo charging stations. Expansion of he fast-charging infrastructure The established Combined Charging System (CCS) stand­ ard is available for charging infrastructure up o a capac­ ity of 400 kilowa s. Currently, 31,000 CCS charging sta­ tions are publicly available in Germany.24 In general, hey are designed for passenger cars, bu some can also serve rucks. 17 MAN, Strategie – MAN auf einen Blick (2024) (in German; available online); Scania, Das Be­ kenntnis von Scania zu ba eriebetriebenen Elektrofahrzeugen (2021) (in German; available online). 18 Daimler Truck, Diskussion Ba erie vs. Wasserstoff: Daimler Truck setz mi beiden Technologien konsequen auf Doppelstrategie (2022) (in German; available online). 19 Volvo Trucks, Gemeinsam in Richtung",

The MCS should make charging capacities of up o 3.75 megawa s (3,750 kilowa s) possible.25 Recently, various private sector actors have announced plans to build specific ruck charging stations in over 200 locations, and construction has already begun on some of hem (Table). On he governmen side, he BMDV and he Federal Ministry for Digital and Transpor (Bundesministerium für Digitales und Verkehr, BMDV) have launched an initiative for a fast-charg­ ing network for rucks26 ha includes around 350 locations on federal highways. An initial ender for ruck charging sta­ tions a around 130 unmanaged res areas has already been launched,27 with another o follow. For all planned station locations, he electrical connection capacities required and corresponding grid connections have already been planned and applied for. The public fas charging infrastructure is primarily needed to make i possible for ba ery-electric rucks o cover he yp­ ical long-distance ranspor profiles.

However, rucks require a lower pressure of 350 bar, which only around half of he existing refueling stations can cur­ rently provide. As of September 2024, here are 42 refue­ ling stations with a pressure level of 350 bar.29 Some man­ ufacturers are also considering using liquid hydrogen in future vehicle models, which entails uncertainty regarding the construction of new refueling stations.30 The previous funding for hydrogen refueling stations from he Climate and Transformation Fund (Klima- und Transformationfonds, KTF) was discontinued due o funding problems. While here are concrete private sector activities and gov­ ernmen enders being undertaken for he ba ery-electric truck charging infrastructure, here is much more planning uncertainty when i comes o he construction of hydrogen refueling stations.

However, a sys­ tematic comparison of differen criteria shows ha his ech­ nology is also facing various challenges,33 including integra­ tion into he power grid and he effects on he stability of he energy system, he space required for he charging infrastruc­ ture, he raw materials required for ba eries, he operational changes required for logistics firms, and he cos of vehicles. Hydrogen has some advantages, bu many drawbacks Hydrogen drives have advantages when i comes o some of he observed criteria. For example, hey do no require fas charging infrastructure o be connected o he power grid, and hus neither any reinforcemen measures in he 33 This section is based on an analysis by Jöhrens e al., Komplementärtechnologien zu BEV-Lkw. higher voltage network. The space requiremen and he need for operational adjustments a logistics firms are also rated as slightly more favorable han for ba ery-electric rucks.34 However, hydrogen rucks have some of heir own chal­ lenges when i comes o infrastructure expansion and energy costs, which ultimately comes down o heir poor energy effi­ ciency (Box). In addition, uncertainty around future energy cos appears o be significantly higher for hydrogen rucks than for ba ery-electric rucks. This is due o he fac ha the hydrogen marke hardly exists o date, bu",

In ligh of he foreseeable high hydrogen demand from other sectors, especially industry, i seems questionable whether significan quantities of green hydrogen can be made avail­ able for road freigh in he medium erm. Barely any pro­ jects have been realized so far, both in domestic production as well as planned hydrogen imports.35 34 Pelzeter e al., Bewertung von Technologiekonfigurationen für den Straßengüterverkehr. 35 Cf. he Ampel-Monitor Energiewende for he state of elctrolysis and its argets as well as Martin Ki el e al., “National Hydrogen Strategy: Clear focus and consisten implementation necessary,” DIW Weekly Repor no. 40+41+42 (2023) (available online). Box Electricity sector analysis: Advantages of hydrogen storage do no outweigh energy-efficiency drawbacks An analysis using DIW Berlin’s open-source electricity sector model DIETER shows ha ba ery-electric vehicles with fas charg­ ing capabilities resul in he lowes electricity sector costs of all options under observation. Even if he ba ery-electric vehicles are no optimally charged, hey still have clear advantages compared to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles or synthetic hydrogen-based e-fuels. The advantages are even greater if he ba eries are flexibly charged based on he electricity marke price in combination with vehicle-to-grid charging, where electricity is fed back o he grid a times. Ba ery-electric vehicles have such an advantage due o he poor energy efficiency of hydrogen and e-fuels, which are assumed to be domestically produced in he model. Domestic production results in considerable costs for he renewable energy used. However, i is often argued ha his drawback could be offse by the advantageous storage capacity of hydrogen and e-fuels, which will become more importan in a future energy system with a high share of variable wind and solar energy. However, he model anal­ yses show ha he energy efficiency drawbacks of hydrogen and e-fuels clearly outweigh heir storage advantages (Figure).1 1 Carlos Gaete-Morales e al., “Power sector effects of alternative options for de-fossilizing heavy-duty vehicles—Go electric, and charge smartly,” Cell Reports Sustainability 1, no. 6 (2024): 100123 (available online).

      "ELECTRIC TRUCKS This also raises he question if hydrogen rucks can even contribute o quickly reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Germany. Their emissions balance over he life cycle, when including vehicle production, seems o offer li le advantage in he medium erm (Figure 6),36 especially if gray hydro­ gen (hydrogen produced from natural gas) is used. I seems plausible ha gray hydrogen will be used because he pro­ duction costs of green hydrogen are likely o remain higher than he costs of gray hydrogen for some ime. The emis­ sions balance is even worse if hydrogen is produced via elec­ trolysis powered by average grid electricity. Even if electrol­ ysis were powered entirely by renewable electricity (green hydrogen), here would no be any emissions advantage over grid-powered ba ery-electric rucks, as he share of renew­ able energy in he power grid is se o rise o a leas 80 per­ cen by 2030. When considering life cycles, ba ery-electric trucks hus have considerable emissions advantages com­ pared o hydrogen rucks, a leas until 2030. Furthermore, the analysis shows ha he production of vehicles (including ba eries) only makes up a small share of he climate impac compared o power supply during he use phase. Other electric echnologies advantageous in subsectors Other electric echnologies ha are no currently widely avail­ able on he marke bu have been ested could partially com­ pensate for some weak spots of ba ery-electric rucks. Such technologies include electric road systems such as overhead line systems or hird-rail systems, which dynamically power electric rucks as hey drive, making i possible o reduce he size of vehicle ba eries. Overhead line systems for rucks have already been comprehensively ested in Germany.37 In addition, ba ery swapping systems for rucks are under discussion. While such systems are already widespread in China, hey have no ye been ested much in Germany. Semi- trailers with electric axels and heir own ba ery (e-trailer), which could initially be used in combination with diesel rac­ tors, are another possibility. Some of hese echnologies have been evaluated as advan­ tageous with respec o a few challenging aspects for he marke ramp-up of ba ery-electric rucks with fas charg­ ing (Figure 7).38 Such challenges include network integra­ tion, he contribution o he stability of he energy system, and he space requirement. However, here is still no sin­ gle echnology ha equally addresses all of he drawbacks of ba ery-electric rucks. In addition, each ype of echnology has its own challenges: An overhead line system, for exam­ ple, requires high initial investmen costs for he core net­ work, and ba ery swapping systems mus be standardized. 36 Julius Jöhrens e al., “Perspektivische Kosten und Klimabilanz von Lkw mi alternativen Antrie­ ben 2030,” enERSyn Schwerpunktpapier no. 2 (forthcoming). 37 Julius Jöhrens e al., “Curren echnical findings on he eHighway system from field ests and accompanying research in Germany,” Working paper compiled by he German cross-projec Work­ ing Group on eHighway Technology (AG Technikbewertung) (2022) (available online).",

Greenhouse gas reduction quota could create strong incentives for hydrogen use The greenhouse gas reduction quota (GHG quota) is a market-based climate change mitigation instrumen ha aims o reduce he use of fossil fuels in he ranspor sec­ tor. Companies ha create fossil fuel emissions in rans­ por are required o reduce heir emissions (including fuel production), with he reduction quota increasing each year. Currently, he quota is 9.35 percen compared o he fossil fuel reference value; in 2030, i will rise o 25.1 percent.39 There are various options for reducing emissions, such as using electric drives or using more electric fuels such as hydrogen. Companies do no have o mee he quotas hem­ selves, bu can rather rade emissions via certificates. However, he GHG quota does no adequately accoun for he be er energy efficiency of ba ery-electric rucks compared o hydrogen rucks. As a result, higher certificate revenues can be achieved by using hydrogen compared o a correspond­ ingly lower amoun of electricity ha can cover he same mileage with a ba ery-electric ruck. If his revenue is used to subsidize he sale of green hydrogen a refueling stations, the price of hydrogen would decline by around wo euros pro kilogram a he curren GHG quota price of around 70 euros per on of CO2. If he certificate prices once again rise o he 2022 level of around 400 euros per on due o rising reduc­ tion quotas, green hydrogen could be subsidized o be sold 39 More information is available on he German customs website (in German; available online).

On the one hand, his focus corresponds with he reality of he marke and hus supports curren private sector activities. On he other hand, hese echnologies correspond with wha is currently he mos plausible path for medium and long- term effective climate change mitigation in heavy road freigh transport.

Governmen funding of oo many alternative echnology options could, in contrast, lead o planning uncertainty for vehicle manufacturers, infrastructure providers, and logis­ tics specialists and hus ultimately delay he ransition of truck drives.

This is in he range of cur­ ren refueling station prices for hydrogen and would drasti­ cally decrease he energy costs of fuel cell rucks, which are presently high.

Conclusion: Focus should be on ba ery-electric drives and fas charging In he debate on he use of alternative drives in heavy road freigh ransport, actors from vehicle manufacturing, logis­ tics, and he hydrogen business often argue ha a broad ech­ nology portfolio is required o quickly and effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

These results correlate with he strategic and investmen motives described in he literature, which are often accompanied by altruistic motives. The decline of remi ances sen by migrants withou a ­refugee background between 2013 and 2016 coincides with the increase in asylum seekers in Europe in 2015 and 2016, when around 1.3 million refugees, mainly from Syria, came to Germany.18 The German population’s increased altruistic commitmen o refugees during his period could explain why fewer migrants sen remi ances abroad.19 The share of refugees who send remi ances abroad is lower than he share of migrants withou a refugee background who remi abroad. From 2013 o 2016, here was a steady decrease from 15 o seven percen (Figure 4). The share of refugees sending remi ances abroad declined in 2015 and 2016 in par­ ticular, similar as o other migrants. Between 2017 and 2020 the share stabilized a around en percen before falling down to seven percen in 2021. Presumably, his upward rend can be explained by economic and job-related difficulties, which many people faced during he coronavirus pandemic.20 The trend suggests ha while refugees wan o maintain strong social bonds and cultural ies o heir home countries and suppor heir families, heir economic situation limits heir ability o remi regularly. Men, small households, and divorcees send remi ances abroad more frequently To understand why people send remi ances abroad, he following section utilizes wo statistical models o investi­ gate he personal and familial factors ha can influence he likelihood of remi ing. In he firs model, variables such as gender, level of education, household size, number of children, marital status, and life satisfaction are considered (Figure 5). The models differentiate between non-migrants (Germans withou a migration background) and migrants (migrants withou a refugee background and refugees). The results show ha migrants are 2.1 percentage points more likely o send remi ances abroad han non-migrants, while refugees are 2.7 percentage points less likely o send remit­ tances han non-migrants. This is in line with studies ha show ha refugees are often subjec o greater economic restrictions, which limits heir ability o send remi ances.21 18 Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung, Demografie von Asylsuchenden in Deutschland (2024) (in German; available online). 19 Chang Woon Nam and Peter Steinhoff, “The Role of Volunteers in German Refugee Crisis and Their Contribution o he Local Governmen Expenditure,” CESifo Working Paper No. 73",

      "Economic Outlook: German economy stuck in limbo while rade conflicts hreaten he global economy By Geraldine Dany-Knedlik, Guido Baldi, Nina Maria Brehl, Hella Engerer, Angelina Hackmann, Pia Hü l, Konstantin Kholodilin, Frederik Kurcz, Laura Pagenhardt, Jan-Christopher Scherer, Teresa Schildmann, Hannah Magdalena Seidl, Ruben Staffa, and Kristin Trautmann EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The German economy is stuck in a difficul position as i faces both slow growth as well as structural change. The continuing lack of orders in manufacturing, increasing international competition, and sluggish developmen in industry-related services are now affecting he labor mar­ ke and leading no only o short-time work bu o layoffs too, despite he continuing skilled worker shortage. While GDP increased slightly by 0.1 percen in he hird quarter of 2023, his growth was preceded by a stronger han initially recorded decline in economic outpu of 0.3 percen in he second quarter. Thus, he German economy canno be said o be on a stable growth path. In contrast, leading indicators sugges ha economic outpu will decline again in he fourth quarter, with overall growth for 2024 likely o be 0.2 percent. This means ha he German economy will contrac for he second year in a row. German industry in particular is experiencing a serious crisis. Foreign rade may emporarily benefit, as many com­ panies despite a lack of demand are expected o increase their exports o he United States in order o ge ahead of the possible ariffs ha US President-elec Donald Trump announced. However, impending protectionis measures are already having an impac and unse ling local compa­ nies, which are herefore postponing investments further. In addition, he economic framework conditions in Ger­ many are unclear and will remain unpredictable until a leas he spring when here is a new federal government. All of hese factors in conjunction with increasing concerns abou heir own jobs are unse ling households in Ger­ many, resulting in private consumption failing o pick up speed despite rising real wages. A gradual easing is no expected until mid-2025, when domestic and foreign economic uncertainties will succes­ sively lessen. Nevertheless, he German economy should expand by 0.2 percen in 2025. Thus, DIW Berlin is revis­ ing its fall forecas downward by 0.7 percentage points. Economic outpu is expected o increase by 1.2 percen in 2026, although his is partially due o non-recurring effects such as a relatively high number of work days. In regard o he global economy, he boom in he United States will remain a key driver for now, compensating for the sluggish recovery in many other advanced econo­ mies as well as China. While he Chinese economy falters, a gradual upswing is continuing in he euro area due o rising purchasing power and falling inflation. In 2024, he global economy is expected o grow by 3.7 percent, while i should grow by 3.6 percen and 3.7 percen in 2025 and 2026, respectively. 313 DIW Weekly Repor 50–52/2024 GLOBAL ECONOMY The sustained boom in he United States is once again determining he expansion",
      "empo of he global economy in 2024, compensating for he sluggish recovery in many other advanced economies and China. Thus, he gap in economic outpu between he United States and other importan econ­ omies such as he euro area is growing. Purchasing power has recovered in he euro area and he United Kingdom and is supporting a gradual upturn here. The Chinese economy is faltering, meaning i will no reach its growth arge of five percen for 2024. Lastly, he economic and rade policies of US President-elec Donald Trump are pu ing he global eco­ nomic order o he est. Global economic growth has picked up speed recently: The global economy expanded by 0.8 percen in he hird quar­ ter of 2024 after growth of 0.7 percen in he second quarter (Figure 1). In he fall, global growth in he advanced econ­ omies was primarily driven by a strong increase of 0.7 per­ cen in he United States. Mos other advanced economies are continuing o recover a a moderate pace; for example, the British and Japanese economies grew by only 0.1 and 0.2 percent, respectively. The euro area, in contrast, contin­ ued its recovery, recording an increase of 0.4 percent. Spain and he Netherlands grew he mos by 0.8 percen each, followed by France by 0.4 percent. In contrast, Italy and Germany stagnated. The economies of he Central and Southeastern EU coun­ tries suffered from weak demand from Germany. In hese countries, economic outpu declined by 0.2 percen in he third quarter of 2024. The only exception was Czechia, where GDP increased by 0.3 percent. Following a weak second quarter, he situation was some­ wha be er for emerging economies. The Chinese economy picked up speed and recorded growth of 0.9 percent. The pace of expansion of he Indian economy has also been stronger recently, and Mexico’s GDP increased by 1.1 percen in he third quarter. In contrast, growth of 0.9 percen in Brazil was weaker han in he previous quarter. Despite he expected geopolitical and rade policy cutbacks, the global economy should expand slightly in he fourth quar­ ter of 2024, in par hanks o China’s increasingly strong eco­ nomic growth. Mos advanced economies are losing momen­ tum slightly, and he leading indicators deteriorated in he fall months. The slump in global industrial production con­ tinues as well: The Purchasing Managers Indices for he United States and he euro area were ilted o he downside from May o September and recently moved sideways. The picture in he services sector appears o be mixed: While he United States experienced strong growth in November, he indices for he euro area fell below he expansion hreshold. In October, he Purchasing Manager’s Index for manufac­ turing in he United Kingdom dropped below 50, a rend tha continued into November. The index for Japanese man­ ufacturing is continuing its sideways movemen slightly below he expansion hreshold. In surveys, he newes polit­ ical developments, such as Trump’s re-election and he col­ lapse of he German",
      "governmen coalition, were only par­ tially reflected. However, hese events are likely o have led to increased uncertainty among firms and private house­ holds alike abou future economic policy frameworks. The bigges uncertainties concern he future rade policy of he United States. To hedge agains his, companies will likely pull orders forward, meaning ha exports o he United States should initially be somewha stronger han expected. However, his will presumably no be reflected in he aggre­ gated global economic output. We expec growth in he United States in he fourth quarter of 2024 will continue o be strong, albei somewha weaker than in he hird quarter, and supported by private consump­ tion in particular. The recovery in he euro area will lose some momentum for he ime being: For example, France is experiencing a weak fourth quarter following he one- off effects related o he Olympic Games. The Japanese and The rising shadow of protectionism is negatively affecting he global economy Figure 1 Growth of real GDP Quarter-on-quarter percentage growth (lef axis); Index 2015 Q1 = 100 (righ axis) Sources: National Statistical Offices; DIW Berlin Economic Outlook Winter 2024. © DIW Berlin 2024 Tightened rade barriers are likely o slow he global economy down somewhat. 314 DIW Weekly Repor 50–52/2024 GLOBAL ECONOMY South Korean economies, in contrast, are projected o gain some momentum again. In China, he outlook has improved due o he recently announced monetary and fiscal policy measures, which has brightened economic sentiment. We assume ha a less restrictive monetary policy will sup­ por economic growth in he coming years. The central banks of many advanced economies will likely cu interes rates further in 2025. The inflation rate continues o be lower in many places, which is mainly due o falling energy prices. Inflation in he services sector remains high in many places. Emerging economies have initiated an interes rate urna­ round earlier and may have reached he end of he inter­ es rate cuts. For example, inflation in Mexico is proving to be more persisten han expected, and he Central Bank of Brazil recently raised interes rates again in response to higher core inflation. In contrast, he People's Bank of China is following a loose monetary policy due o deflation­ ary endencies. Fiscal policy is slightly expansionary in mos economies. In the United Kingdom, he Labour governmen passed its fall budget, ushering in an expansionary fiscal policy. Fiscal pol­ icy in he United States is also likely o be expansionary over the forecas horizon due o many of President-elec Trump’s proposals. A he end of September, he Chinese governmen announced its larges stimulus package since he pandemic. Equaling around 1,300 billion euros, he package focuses on solving he deb problems of local governments. An excep­ tion o he expansionary fiscal policy is he euro area, where fiscal policy will likely remain slightly restrictive over he forecas period.

      "rade in he hird quarter. Assuming tha global rade barriers are ightened from 2025 onwards, international rade is likely o be stronger in he fourth quar­ ter of 2024, due o anticipated purchases . Therefore, overall growth of 1.2 percen is expected for 2024. Only a moderate upswing is expected for 2025 and 2026 due o likely ighter trade barriers. Furthermore, industry’s ongoing weak growth should continue o weigh on international rade before fall­ ing interes rates boos corporate investmen somewha a the end of 2025 and suppor international rade. In he coming years, he expected increase in rade barri­ ers is likely o slow global economic growth. This forecas assumes ha he US governmen will increase ariff rates on Chinese goods imports by 10 percentage points, resulting in an average rate on Chinese exports of around 30 percent. A the same ime, he forecas also assumes ha he aluminum and steel ariffs on he European Union, which had been sus­ pended by he Biden administration, will be reintroduced. In reaction o he increase in US ariffs, i is assumed ha the economies affected will ake argeted countermeasures, bu avoid an escalation. Due o ariff asymmetries, regions may be affected differently. Box 1 Assumptions and framework conditions Assumptions abou interes rates, exchange rates, and energy prices This forecas is based on he following assumptions abou he further developmen of key interes rates, exchange rates, and commodity prices (Table). These assumptions were made based on previous developments, futures markets prices, and he clos­ ing prices on he date of his forecas (November 12, 2024). The European Central Bank (ECB) decreased interes rates once again in October, hus continuing he path of normalization. For he win­ ter forecast, four further interes rate cuts of 25 basis points each are assumed for he deposi rate until spring 2025. The money marke interes rates also fell in line with key interes rates. We expec ha key interes rates will continue o fall until mid-2025 and hen remain a ha level. The ransmission of interes rate cuts into he real economy is also beginning o show. For example, he refinancing costs for households and firms began o decline in he second quarter of 2024, and his decline is likely o continue in line with key interes rates. The yield on governmen bonds increased again slightly in he fourth quarter of 2024. We assume ha cap­ ital marke interes rates will remain largely unchanged over he forecas horizon a 2.3 percen for Germany and 2.9 percen for he euro area. The euro has recently appreciated slightly agains he US dollar. For he forecas period, i is assumed ha he exchange rate of EUR o USD will remain a 1.07 USD per EUR, he level reached a he end of he data period. According o futures, he price for Bren oil should increase slightly in he coming months before declining again a he star of 2025 until he end of he forecas period. In 2024, he average",
      "price should be 81 USD per barrel before declining o an average of 73 USD per barrel in 2025 and finally o 71 USD per barrel in 2026. The wholesale price for gas (TTF) rose over he course of 2024 and should be 34 euros per megawa hour on average. Over he forecas horizon, we assume tha he prices will increase o 40 euros in 2025 before falling o 34 euros per megawa hour in 2026. Geopolitical and rade policy assumptions Additionally, he forecas assumes ha here will be no further es­ calation in he war in Ukraine. In he Middle East, an easing of en­ sions is becoming increasingly less likely. The fall of former Syrian Presiden Bashar al-Assad is causing uncertainty and could lead o higher oil and gas prices. In addition, his forecas assumes ha US President-elec Trump will implemen some of he rade ariffs he has announced. I is assumed ha he American governmen will increase ariff rates by 10 percentage points for all goods imported from China in he firs quarter of 2025. As a result, he average tariff rate on Chinese goods, which is currently around 20 percent, would increase again by half o around 30 percen (including automotive ariffs and 100-percen ariffs on e-cars). The ariffs on European Union aluminum and steel, which had been suspended, will be implemented again (10 percen for aluminum and 25 per­ cen for steel). Furthermore, rade partners will presumably forego broad countermeasures and only reac with retaliatory ariffs on specific groups of goods.

President-elec Donald Trump has made contradictory and sometimes extreme announcements abou ariff increases. I is likely ha Trump will continue he rade policy of his firs erm and ha he hrea of additional impor ariffs will primarily serve as a",
      "means of exerting pressure in bilateral negotiations, with ariffs likely o be implemented only partially. Concretely, his forecas assumes ha following Trump’s inaugu­ ration, ariffs on Chinese goods will increase by 10 percent1 and the ariffs on European Union aluminum and steel, which were suspended by he Biden administration (10 percen for aluminum and 25 percen for steel), will be reimplemented. Furthermore, he United States’ rade partners will presumably avoid broad counter­ measures and only reac with retaliatory ariffs on specific groups of goods. Although Trump announced further drastic measures such as universal impor ariffs of 10 or 20 percen during his election campaign, hese would have considerable economic and polit­ ical implications if implemented. On he one hand, ariffs of his magnitude would considerably increase he prices of imported goods and hus create strong inflation, potentially accompanied by supply chain disruptions and a supply shortage in he United States.2 This is likely o be me with considerable resistance from the public as well as from industry. For example, a study has shown tha high inflation rates considerably decrease approval of he reigning government.3 In addition, a sharp increase in impor ariffs could destabilize he stock markets, as indicated by he recen drop in shares of he car manufacturers General Motors and Ford following Trump’s announcements of ariffs on Mexican imports. Finally, here are legal hurdles which, despite he US President’s far-reaching powers, are likely o make an escalation in rade spol­ icy more difficult. If all ariffs actually are implemented, hey will cause significan real economic distortions Nevertheless, here is grea uncertainty regarding hese assump­ tions and i seems possible ha considerably comprehensive pro­ tectionis measures will be implemented. Drastic impor ariffs are no only justified as a means of obtaining concessions from rade partners, bu also as a means of generating public revenue as well 1 Cf. Vivek Mishra and Kevin Yao, “Trump o Unleash Nearly 40 Tariffs on China in Early 2025, Hi ing Growth: Reuters Poll,” Reuters, November 20, 2024 (available online). 2 Cf. Warwick J. McKibbin, Megan Hogan, and Marcus Noland, “International Economic Implica­ tions of a Second Trump Presidency,” Working Papers 24-20 (2024: Peterson Institute for Interna­ tional Economics) (available online). 3 Cf. David Steinberg, Daniel McDowell, and Erdem Aytac, “The Impac of Inflation on Suppor for Kamala Harris in he 2024 Presidential Election,” (2024) (available online). as maintaining domestic industry and related jobs. Although hese justifications are no empirically sound, hey could poin o he actual implementation of more far-reaching ariffs. For example, Trump has repeatedly announced universal impor tariffs of 10 percen and ariffs on Chinese imports of 60 percent. This would be a drastic break from previous American rade pol­ icy; for example, he average effective ariff rate in 2023 was only 3.8 percent. Such a massive ightening of rade policy would also have very negative economic consequences for he United States. For example, model calculations4 show ha implementing univer­ sal impor ariffs of 10 percen withou rade policy reactions would",
      "reduce US production by 0.4 percentage points by he end of he forecas horizon. In he year of he ariff increase, inflation would be 0.6 percentage points higher. The Federal Reserve would likely respond o his strong price pressure with a restrictive course, which would dampen domestic economic activity. In he long erm, comprehensive ariffs are also likely o weaken he competitiveness of he US economy due o higher production costs and he shifting of resources o less pro­ ductive sectors.5 The United States’ rade partners could respond with broad retaliatory ariffs, which could rigger a rade war and further destabilize international rade relations. Positive effects of the impor ariffs on he US economy will likely be limited. For ex­ ample, a study6 shows ha he ariffs during Trump’s firs erm did no create any jobs in ariffed sectors. On he contrary, he result­ ing counter ariffs imposed by China were economically costly for the United States7 and negatively affected employmen levels.8 A he same ime, he ariffs would no reduce he rade deficit,9 partly due o an expected appreciation of he US dollar, which makes exports more expensive and imports cheaper. The global economy would also be hi hard by such a comprehen­ sive increase in US ariffs. For example, exports will decline and production will fall in he res of he world, while a he same ime goods imported from he United States will become more expen­ sive due o a likely appreciation of he US dollar. The negative con­ sequences for individual countries will likely depend on he ariff amoun and he country’s dependency on he United States as a trade partner.

I is clear ha he share of all exports o he United States of otal exports is rather low for large EU Member States. The economic consequences of he ariffs may hus be rather limited overall, bu there are significan regional differences. A study10 investigated possible consequences of a universal",
      "impor ariff of 10 percent, 60 percen on Chinese imports, and 100 percen on all imported cars. According o he model calculations in he study, he EU’s GDP is expected o decline by around 0.11 percent.11 Germany’s economy, in contrast, would be hi even harder; impos­ ing impor ariffs on cars would severely affec German industry.12 In addition, he United States is he mos importan individual sales marke for German pharmaceutical companies. If US gas exports o he EU are used as a means of political pressure, there is also he risk ha energy prices will rise again. This would likely further burden he beleaguered manufacturing industry in Germany in particular. However, Germany could benefi from ariff asymmetries and rade diversification, which may somewha com­ pensate for he negative effects; an escalation of he rade conflic between he United States and China ha entails significantly higher ariffs on both rade partners would make German products relatively more affordable. A he same ime, he ariff policy may lead o more diversification of rade relationships with other coun­ tries,13 which could further increase demand for German products. With a share of around 15 percen of otal expor volume in 2023, the United States is China’s mos importan rade partner. An in­ crease in ariffs on all imported Chinese goods o 60 percen would hi he Chinese economy hard and lead o distortions in interna­ tional rade. A he same ime, China may, as in 2018, ake counter­ measures, which would likely strengthen he effect. During he firs Trump administration, he counter ariffs were around he amoun of he American ariffs, which avoided an escalation. Tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods could resul in significan economic losses for both countries. In Canada, he crude oil sec­ tor14 would be affected, while in Mexcio, he automobile industry, the country's mos importan industrial sector, would be affected in particular. 10 Cf.

For emerging economies, he expected appreciation of he US dol­ lar due o he sharp increase in impor ariffs would be associated with considerable disadvantages, as heir debts are denominated in dollars.

While a pro­ tectionis rade policy and restrictive immigration policy will lead o price pressure, falling energy prices will likely dampen this pressure in he forecas period. Continued strong con­ sumption should contribute o growth, supported by house­ holds’ good financial situation, a solid labor market, and planned ax relief for private households under he new gov­ ernment. Corporate investments will likely suppor growth as well, driven by be er financing conditions, he recovery of he real estate sector, and an expected decrease in he cor­ porate income ax. The euro area economy should expand further in 2025 and 2026 due o strong domestic demand as a resul of rising real wages (Figure 2). The effects of US ariffs as assumed in his forecas should only marginally hamper growth. While he United States is an importan rade partner for European economies, its marke share for exports from he large EU Member States is in he single digits on average and here­ fore relatively small compared o ha of he Member States’ trade partners within he EU (Box 2). The outlook for he emerging economies remains favora­ ble, bu he new US governmen is likely o increase rade policy uncertainty. In addition o China, Mexico may be he country mos affected by impor ariffs. In China, he mos recen stimulus package is generating growth, although he American impor ariffs on Chinese products will weigh heavily on goods exports. In 2024, advanced economies are projected o expand by 1.8 percen and emerging economies by 4.7 percent. A growth rate of 3.7 percen is expected for he global economy in 2024, while growth of 3.6 and 3.7 percen is expected for 2025 and 2026, respectively. The forecas for 2025 has been adjusted downward by 0.1 percentage points. This moderate down­ ward correction results from he fac ha he assumed rade barriers are offse by more dynamic growth in he United States (Table 1). Downward risks for he global economy have increased con­ siderably since he fall. Geopolitical risks remain quite high. Further escalation in he Middle Eas could increase oil and gas prices even more. The war in Ukraine remains incalcu­ lable, especially following Trump’s re-election, which has increased economic and security policy risks overall.",
      "This forecas makes assumptions abou future US rade and fiscal policy after Trump’s inauguration in January 2025 (Box 1). However, if here are considerably higher rade bar­ riers han assumed in his forecast, here are likely o be greater global economic fallouts (Box 2). A further risk fac­ tor is public deb sustainability. In France, governmen bond yields have risen, as he resignation of French Prime Minister Michel Barnier has increased doubts abou a reduction in the deb burden. 319 DIW Weekly Repor 50–52/2024 GERMAN ECONOMY The German economy continues o experience weak growth. In addition o he ongoing global industrial slump, he eco­ nomic structural change in Germany is having a noticeable impact: Structural adaptation in he manufacturing indus­ try, for example o stronger international competition, has now reached industry-related sectors such as business-re­ lated services and are affecting he labor market. Companies in industry as well as hose in industry-related sectors are responding o he lack of orders no only by expanding short- time work, bu also by laying off some of heir staff despite the ongoing skilled worker shortage. Accordingly, unem­ ploymen has increased again recently. While economic out­ pu increased slightly (by 0.1 percent) in he hird quarter of 2024, his growth was preceded by a strong decline (by 0.3 percent) in he second quarter (Figure 2). Exports and investments in particular have declined again, likely also due o structural reasons. Persistently weak for­ eign demand for local manufacturing products was also evi­ den in he hird quarter: Exports dropped significantly, goods exports experienced a considerable slump. This in combina­ tion with slightly positive imports resulted in a negative rade balance. Thus, foreign rade depressed economic growth in Germany. Investments in equipmen and construction were also on he decline again. Nonetheless, GDP increased slightly in he hird quarter, which can be a ributed o a moderate expansion of private consumption on he one hand. However, as his growth fol­ lowed a steep decline in he previous quarter, his canno be considered a recovery. Taking into accoun stable inflation rates and sustained wage increases, which were once again strong in he hird quarter, he expansion of private con­ sumption seems rather restrained. In ligh of he impending layoffs a major industrial companies, many private house­ holds are likely o be more concerned abou heir own jobs. I seems ha hey are saving more money again ou of cau­ tion: The savings rate increased for he fourth quarter in a row. On he other hand, inventories were expanded signif­ icantly and supported economic development: Companies produced more han was consumed, resulting in GDP being higher han he sum of its components. Examining individual economic sectors makes i clear ha the crisis in German industry is worsening and noticeably impacting other sectors. The gross value added of manu­ facturing as well as he construction sector have recently declined. I declined by 1.4 percen for manufacturing, con­ siderably more han expected in he fall. The gross value added of some",
      "services, such as professional services firms, financial services and insurance providers, and information and communication services, declined. Strong growth in public services and other service providers are keeping over­ all gross value added from dipping into he red. The re-election of Donald Trump and he collapse of he German governmen coalition a he beginning of November created further uncertainty abou he economic policy frame­ work of he coming years, especially among companies. The outlook for foreign rade has worsened, as he Trump admin­ istration will likely increase rade barriers significantly start­ ing in 2025. This forecas assumes ha after Trump akes office, he will reimpose 10-percen ariffs on steel and 25-per­ cen ariffs on aluminum ha had previously been repealed by curren US Presiden Joe Biden. Moreover, i assumes ha the ariff rate for Chinese exports o he United States will increase by 10 percentage points. The average ariff rate on goods imports from China o he United States will likely be 30 percen instead of around 20 percen (Box 1). Domestically, here is still no federal budge for 2025 due o the collapse of he governmen coalition and he snap elec­ tion. Provisional budge managemen applies following he collapse, under which expenditure may only be incurred Figure 2 Growth of real GDP in Germany In billions of euros (lef axis) and quarter-on-quarter in percen (righ axis) Note: Forecas from he fourth quarter of 2024; adjusted for price, seasonal, and calendar effects.

German economy still struggling o make headway 320 DIW Weekly Repor 50–52/2024 GERMAN ECONOMY The increased uncertainty is hi ing he German economy in an already extremely difficul situation between cyclical weakness and structural change. Thus, another decline in economic outpu is expected in he curren fourth quarter (Table 2). Leading indicators from he beginning of he cur­ ren quarter, i.e., before he US presidential election and he collapse of he German governmen coalition caused addi­ tional uncertainty, sugges ha he industrial slump would have continued regardless of he additional negative factors and ha a recovery would have been delayed again. The Global Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index remained below he expansion hreshold of 50 index points in October. In November, he index declined again. While he index for industry stagnated below he expansion hreshold of 50, he index for services fell below his hreshold for he firs ime since February. I should be noted ha only some of he sur­ veys ook place following Trump’s re-election and he col­ lapse of he German governmen coalition. The exten o which hese political developments have further depressed sentimen will probably only become fully apparen in he December survey. Meanwhile, he order situation remains weak for both services as well as manufacturing. For exam­ ple, gross value added in he curren fourth quarter is likely to decline slightly overall, ye sligh increases in he ser­ vice",
      "sectors will compensate for further declines in indus­ trial production. The uncertainties due o foreign and domestic political devel­ opments should resul in companies acting more reserved in to “maintain existing institutions, legal obligations of he federal government,”1 and for measures ha have already been adopted. In addition, some fiscal policy suppor ha had already passed he Federal Cabine bu had no ye been approved by he Bundestag will no longer find a major­ ity under he curren minority government. This suppor includes measures aimed a stimulating investment, such as he extension of degressive depreciation rules, which were introduced as par of he growth initiative announced in late summer. Planned adjustments o he income ax rate o eliminate bracke creep and he increase in he child allow­ ance and child benefi are also unlikely o happen for he time being. This forecas assumes ha a governmen will be formed and a budge resolution agreed upon in early sum­ mer 2025, which will suppor he financial situation of he federal ministries and agencies and hus governmen con­ sumption. However, as new governmen plans and fiscal pol­ icy measures canno ye be known, fiscal policy will remain restrictive for he ime being. Due o uncertainties abou a new government’s economic policy orientation, companies located in Germany in particular are likely o ac carefully. Thus, investmen decisions are likely o be delayed o 2025. 1 The legal basis for provisional budge managemen is Article 111 of he Basic Law. The erm “institutions” includes constitutional bodies, federal agencies, institutions, and construction facil­ ities, for example. Maintaining existing institutions includes ongoing personnel costs, costs relat­ ed o filling new positions, and replacemen equipmen costs. “Legal obligations” include, among other hings, benefi claims from Social Code II (SGB II) such as he citizen’s benefi (Bürgergeld), housing allowance (Wohngeld), parental allowance (Elterngeld), and expenditure obligations from international agreements.

The deteriorating external eco­ nomic environmen is also having an dampening impac on foreign rade as well as he willingness o invest. On he flip side, exports o he United States are expected o be pulled forward o he curren and upcoming quarters, as he risk of steep ariff increases goes well beyond he reintroduction of aluminum and steel ariffs assumed in his forecast. The temporary rise in exports should in urn boos imports of intermediary goods. Overall, foreign rade is expected o once again make a negative contribution o GDP in his quarter. Private consumption should continue o develop weakly, barely supporting economic developmen in he fourth quar­ ter. Job worries in particular are dampening private house­ holds’ willingness o spend. This is reflected in he savings rate, which has been rising for four quarters. In addition, the price level, which has become permanently higher, is slowing consumption despite rising real disposable income. Construction investments in which residential construction largely driven by private households plays a key role are likely to decline again. We expec ha he economic situation will relax very gradu­ ally over he further course of he forecast. From mid-2025, with a new federal governmen and clearer external economic conditions, more and more uncertainties will dissipate and make households and companies more confiden again. The stabilization of employmen over he course of 2025, which should even grow somewha in 2026 should also contribute to his. Accordingly, unemploymen will gradually decline. As a result, we expec ha more of he higher disposable incomes and a leas some of he household savings will",
      "be spen again. Construction and equipmen investments should hen stabilize, with he la er likely also being sup­ ported by governmen expenditure in 2025 in particular as a par of he Bundeswehr’s special fund. Companies will likely increasingly inves in heir production capacities beginning in 2026. As European industry increasingly recovers, foreign demand will rise and he European Central Bank (ECB), as assumed, will cu interes rates further and German exports will likely pick up speed again. While monetary policy will become increasingly less restric­ tive due o further interes rate cuts over he course of he forecas period, fiscal policy will likely remain restrictive. On the one hand, his is due o he expiry of expansionary meas­ ures in response o he energy crisis, he end of ax breaks, and ax increases. On he other hand, we assume ha he col­ lapse of he coalition will mean ha revenue-reducing legis­ lation will no longer be implemented, hus decreasing expan­ sionary stimuli. Due o he snap elections for he German Bundestag, he overall direction of fiscal policy during he forecas period is subjec o a high degree of uncertainty. All in all, price-adjusted GDP will likely contrac by 0.2 per­ cen in 2024 for he second year in a row (Table 3). In 2025, global economic outpu should expand by 0.2 percent, con­ siderably less han was expected in he fall. Growth will be stronger in 2026 a 1.2 percent. However, his will be in par due o non-recurring effects such as a comparatively high number of work days. Thus, DIW Berlin is lowering its fore­ cas for 2024 by 0.5 percentage points and for 2025 and 2026 by 0.7 and 0.2 percentage points, respectively. The signifi­ can downward revision in some cases is primarily due o he enormous additional burdens on he German economy due to he many uncertainties, both for companies as well as pri­ vate households. With his forecast, DIW Berlin is revising potential GDP downward again. In 2029, potential growth of he German economy should still be 0.3 percent. Overall, the outpu gap for 2024 and 2025 is likely o be a bi larger than expected in fall. The gap will be −1.0 percen for 2024 and −0.9 percen for 2025. Over he course of he recovery, the gap is expected o nearly close a −0.2 percen in 2026. Following he strong growth of previous years, average con­ sumer price inflation should be 2.2 percent, primarily due to falling energy prices. This is close o he ECB’s wo-per­ cen arge In he coming years, he inflation rate is expected to level off a wo percent. Thus, DIW Berlin’s inflation fore­ cas remains unchanged compared o he fall. The core rate (inflation excluding energy and food) should also decline fur­ ther and come closer o he inflation arget, bu more slowly than he overall rate of inflation. The downside risks for he German economy grew signifi­ cantly larger in he fall. In particular, domestic and foreign economic",
      "policy uncertainties pose a risk of real economic distortions ha could be significantly greater han assumed in his forecast.

Thus, growth has slightly picked up again. In some of he groups of companies analyzed, he figure was even higher. Around 23 percen of executive board members a he DAX 40 companies, for example, are women. The larges banks and insurance companies, which in he pas years have lagged considerably behind other private sector companies and companies with government-owned shares, managed o catch up a bit. In many places, his growth is due o he fac ha companies have appointed a woman o heir executive board for he firs time. Beyond hat, here is currently no much progress. In addition, he number of women holding he position of CEO has decreased in many groups of companies. More commit­ men is needed from companies, both internally (e.g., from the supervisory board) and externally (e.g., from investors) o achieve gender parity in senior leadership positions. Since 2006, DIW Berlin’s Women Executives Barometer has been documenting he share of women1 on managemen boards and among managing directors (hereafter referred to as “executive boards”) as well as on supervisory, admin­ istrative, and advisory boards as well as boards of rustees (hereafter “supervisory boards”) of he larges companies in Germany.2 I is also documented o wha exten women hold executive board chair and executive board spokesper­ son positions (hereafter “CEO”) as well as supervisory board chair positions. These shares of women are reported here for he 200 larges companies in Germany (measured by revenue),3 all DAX companies,4 all companies with govern­ ment-owned shares,5 he 100 larges banks6 (measured by balance shee otal), and he 60 larges insurance companies7 (measured by revenue from contributions).

On average, women have made up almos one third of supervisory board members for several years now. The number of women leading a supervisory board among the 200 larges companies grew from 11 in 2022 o 13, a good eigh percent, in late fall 2023.11 In he fourth quarter of 2023, the 100 larges companies had seven women (eigh percent) supervisory board chairs. 11 Top 200: Anna Borg (Va enfall Deutschland), Anja Ritschel (Enercity AG), Be ina Würth (Würth-Gruppe), Cathrina Claas-Mühlhäuser (Claas KGaA mbH), Catherine Vandenborre (50Hertz Transmission GmbH), Clara C.

Publicly listed companies DAX 40 companies have he larges share of women on executive boards, bu MDAX and TecDAX companies are catching up In late fall 2023, he average share of women on he executive boards of he 160 publicly listed companies analyzed here (DAX 40, MDAX, SDAX, and TecDAX) was a good 18 per­ cent, hus nearly hree percentage points higher han in 2022. This share is very similar o he shares of women on the executive boards of he 200 and 100 larges companies. However, his average conceals major differences between the individual DAX groups. The larges publicly listed compa­ nies, he DAX 40, have had a larger share of women on heir executive boards han he SDAX, MDAX, and TecDAX com­ panies for more han en years (Table 2 and Table 3). There was a particularly strong increase in he share of women a the executive level in he DAX 40 group between 2020 and 2022 from almos 15 percen o nearly 22 percent.

The TecDAX companies have developed similarly (Table 3): The share of women on executive boards experienced a comparatively strong increase of nearly five percentage points o around 21 percent. The share of women on he executive boards of SDAX companies grew much less: A a good 14 percent, he SDAX companies have he lowes share of women executive board members of all DAX groups. Moreover, he increase was no especially large, a only around wo percentage points. In contas o he growth of women on executive boards, he growth of women CEOs was either negative or stagnated, as is he case a he 200 and 100 larges companies. While wo DAX 40 companies had women CEOs in 2022, as of late fall 2023, here was only one: Belén Garijo, he CEO of Merck. One TecDAX company had a woman CEO in 2022, bu as of late fall 2023, ha is no longer he case. There was no change in he MDAX and SDAX companies, where here were wo and five women CEOs, respectively, as of he fourth quarter of 2023, as was he case in 2022. Comparing he DAX groups, the SDAX companies were ahead a jus over seven percen women CEOs, which contrasts with heir comparatively low share of women among executive board members overall.12 Sligh increase in he share of women on supervisory boards of all DAX groups In late fall 2023, he average share of women on super visory boards a all 160 DAX companies was nearly 36 percent, around wo percentage points higher han in 2022.

This law states, among other hings, ha publicly listed companies with full co-determination whose executive board has a leas four members mus have a leas one executive board position filled by a member of he under­ represented gender. 20 As of late fall 2023, 63 companies are required o comply with his regulation. These companies had, on average, a share of a good 21 percen women on heir executive boards (Table 6). Thus, his group of companies is behind companies with government-owned shares (34 per­ cent) and jus behind he DAX 40 companies (23 percent), bu is ahead of he res of he groups examined here. The compa­ nies subjec o he gender quota for supervisory boards had an average share of women supervisory board members of nearly 38 percent, hus pu ing his group slightly behind he companies with government-owned shares (a solid 39 per­ cent) and he DAX 40 companies (jus over 38 percent), bu ahead of all other groups of companies. The positive effects of he legal requirements for women on these boards are becoming visible over ime as he shares of women grow: Within he 200 larges companies, a com­ parison of he companies ha are subjec o he supervisory board quota with he companies no subjec o i shows ha there has been a signifcantly stronger increase in he share of women in he “quota companies,” especially from 2014 o 2019 as well as since 2021 (Figure 3). Since 2014, he share of women on he supervisory boards of he companies sub­ jec o he quota (quota companies) among he 200 larges companies has increased",
      "by over 17 percentage points (from around 20 o nearly 37 percent). Among he companies in he top 200 group no subjec o he quota, he share of women on supervisory boards only increased by around 12 perent­ age points (from almos 16 o around 28 percent) in he same period of ime and was, as of late fall 2023, nearly en per­ centage points lower han he share of women in he quota companies. There has been barely any growth in he non- quota companies over he pas years, while he quota com­ panies have clearly continued o strive for gender parity even after reaching he legal minimum of 30 percent. The inclusion requiremen for executive boards introduced in 2021 is also clearly having an impact: From 2017 o 2020, the share of women on executive boards of he companies in the op 200 group ha would later be subjec o he require­ men as well as hose ha would no be subjec o he require­ men developed a he same pace (Figure 4).

Around 40 percen had exactly one woman on he executive board, while only 16 percen had wo or more women. Conclusion: Companies need more commi men to gender parity internally and externally From 2022 o 2023, he share of women on he executive boards of he larges companies in Germany increased in all groups of companies analyzed. In particular, companies in fall 2021.21 Of he companies in he op 200 group ha are subjec o he inclusion requirement, he share of women on executive boards was recently 22 percent, which is an over eight-percentage-poin increase since 2020. The res of he 200 larges companies no subjec o he requiremen had a considerably lower share of women on executive boards a a good 17 percen in fall 2023. Since 2020, i has increased by around six percentage points, making he gap between the wo groups a li le over five percentage points (instead of under hree percentage points in 2020). Overall, 58 of he 63 companies subjec o he inclusion requiremen for he executive board had a leas one woman on he executive board in late fall 2023 (Table 6).

However, in his group of compa­ nies, as in mos of he others, he number of women remains a one. Among he 200 larges companies, for example, here is still a significan share of executive boards withou a single woman, around 44 percent. Moreover, he position of CEO remains heavily dominated by men: Only nine women were the CEO of a op 200 company as of late fall 2023; among the DAX 40 companies, only one woman had his position. No only is he share of women CEOs still negligible, here is no even an upward rend discernable—rather he opposite.

The arge of zero women on he executive board se by many companies a few years ago22 has appar­ ently been replaced by a arge of one woman on he execu­ tive board.

Companies may have li le motivation o appoin more women once hey have reached a minimum level of gender diversity, and hereby keep women underrepresented on executive boards. To achieve equal participation of women and men on execu­ tive boards, more commitmen is required, both within com­ panies and without.

      "men. This difference, known as he gender care gap, varies considerably between European countries, with Germany somewhere in he middle of he distribution. This Weekly Repor analyzes he institutional, societal, and labor marke factors ha are related o he gender care gap across European countries. The results show ha he gap is smaller in countries ha spend more on he formal care system. In addition, hey show ha he gender care gap ends to be larger in countries ha exhibi high gender inequality and high inequality in labor marke participation between men and women. Thus, he results emphasize ha he gender pay gap correlates with governmen investments in health care, he care system, and he labor marke structure. To reduce he gender care gap, expenditure on formal care should be increased o relieve informal caregivers and improve he quality of care in professional facilities. A he same ime, policymakers should use ax and family policy incentives o increase women’s workforce participation so ha paid work and care work are more evenly distributed. One of he key future social and health policy challenges is the increasing amoun of people requiring care as society ages. Currently, around five million people receive benefits from long-term care insurance in Germany and according to curren estimates, his figure will increase over he com­ ing decades.1 The majority of people requiring care receive care a home (83 percent). Nearly 14 percen of his majority belong o Pflegegrad I (long-term care level I, “minor restric­ tion of independence”) and only receive minimal additional benefits from long-term care insurance. Around 60 percen of people receiving care a home only receive a care allow­ ance (Pflegegeld), meaning hey organize informal care with­ ou professional assistance.2 The other 25 percen of people requiring care in heir own home organize heir care with he help of outpatien nursing and care services, which usually also includes informal care provided by relatives. Informal care, especially withou professional help, is ime consuming and frequently results in he caretaking rela­ tives reducing or giving up paid employmen or ending heir search for paid employment. Like childcare, i is mainly women who provide informal care, interrupting heir careers to do so.3 The difference between he amoun of informal care work performed by men and women is known as he gender care gap in long-term care.4 In his Weekly Report, the shortened erm gender care gap is used.5 1 In a curren estimate, he Federal Statistical Office reports ha he number of people receiving benefits will increase o 6.8 million by 2055 if prevalence rates remain he same. If he prevalence rates continue o rend upward, he number will be much higher.

For more, see he DIW Berlin Glossary (in Ger­ man; available online). 5 The large share of women performing care work is reflected in he formal care sector as well. According o OECD evaluations, he average share of women working in professional long-term care in OECD countries is around 90 percent. This frequently includes jobs with poor working con­ ditions and comparatively low wages (OECD, “Women are well-represented in health and long- term care professions, bu often in jobs with poor working conditions,” (2019) (available online)). 57 DIW Weekly Repor 7/2024 GENDER CARE GAP The gender care gap is a significan factor contributing o employmen and income inequality between men and wom­ en.6 This does no only apply o curren income possibilities, bu also o he amoun of future pension entitlements, as hey directly depend on how much remuneration subjec o pen­ sion insurance a person has earned.7 The differences in pen­ sion entitlements between women and men are often linked to gender differences in employmen histories.8 The above-average number of women caring for relatives is often explained by labor marke differences between he gen­ ders: Women frequently earn less and work fewer hours han their partner, so reducing heir hours or qui ing heir job to perform caretaking duties reduces he household income less han if heir partner were o work fewer hours or quit. Social norms ha regard care work as women’s work also contribute o he gap. Moreover, he underlying care system may be reinforcing he differences in informal care provided by women and men. For example, a strong welfare state ha spends a significan amoun on formal care offers, such as outpatien care services, adul daycare, or in-patien nursing homes, can mitigate gender differences in informal care, as generally less informal care is needed. This Weekly Repor investigates how he gender care gap in Germany differs from he gap in other European countries.9 I also shows how he gender care gap correlates with govern­ men spending on care as well as with he societal and labor marke inequality between men and women. The analysis uses data from he Survey of Health, Ageing and Retiremen in Europe (SHARE), which includes people aged 50 or older in 17 European countries. In addition o key socio-demo­ graphic indicators, he data contains detailed information on informal care provided (Box on data and sample).10 Women perform more care work han men in all countries analyzed This Weekly Repor only considers informal care work per­ formed for someone outside of one’s own household—such as help with ge ing dressed, bathing or showering, eating meals, ge ing in or ou of bed, or using he oilet—when cal­ culating he gender care gap. Caretaking duties performed for one’s partner in one’s",
      "own household are no considered here. The absolute difference between he shares of men and women acting as informal caregivers is adjusted for age 6 Clara Schäper, Annekatrin Schrenker, and Katharina Wrohlich, “Gender Care Gap and Gender Pay Gap Increase Substantially until Middle Age,” DIW Weekly Report, no. 9 (2023): 83–88 ( available online; accessed on January 30, 2024). 7 Informal care provided by caregivers who have no ye fully retired is now credited with pension entitlements and hese periods also coun as compulsory insurance periods.

Although he gender care gap differs between countries, a clear rend emerges: In all countries, women perform more informal care work han men (Figure 1). The gap is small­ es in Portugal, Switzerland, and Sweden, where i is around 60 o 90 percent. This means ha women are 60 o 90 per­ cen more likely han men o provide care, i.e., slightly less than wice as often. The adjusted relative gender care gap is 200 percen or higher in he countries with he highes gaps, Luxembourg, Greece, and Croatia. Here, he share of women caregivers is hree imes as high as he share of men caregivers. The gender care gap is 133 percen in Germany, meaning women are wice as likely o care for relatives as men. Thus, Germany is in he middle of he distribution of the countries observed here. Mos countries also have distinc gender differences in regard o he regularity and frequency with which men and 11 This refers o he age and level of education of he caregiver.

In many countries, women are significantly more likely o provide daily care than men. In Portugal, Greece, and Denmark, women are around hree imes as likely as men o provide care on a daily basis. The considerable gender differences in hese countries are often also eviden in erms of weekly care. The share of women and men who provide care on a daily basis is abou the same in only a few countries, such as Sweden, France, or Poland. However, gender differences in weekly care are often significantly higher in hese countries, resulting in a positive gender care gap (see Figure 1). In Germany, women are around wice as likely as men o provide care on a daily basis and around hree imes as likely o provide care on a weekly basis. The care system influences he gender care gap Taking a closer look, systematic regional differences are noticeable: While informal care is performed less fre­ quently overall in Northern and Eastern European coun­ tries (Figure 2, left), i is performed more frequently overall in Southern and Western European countries (Figure 2, center and right), where he gender care gap is often larger. In he countries where a lo of informal care is provided, women are frequently performing he care work. This suggests ha women perform a large share of private, informal care work. Germany is in he middle of he distribution here as well. To capture country-specific differences in he care systems, this Weekly Repor considers he respective expenditure on long-term care, both overall as well as on in-patien care in professional facilities (Table in Box). Higher proportional expenditure on care is interpreted as an indicator of a bet­ ter care system. In particular, expenditure on inpatien care indicates a pronounced formal care sector ha can relieve caregiving relatives. Countries with higher care expenditure have lower gender care gaps The results of he analysis (Figure 3) show ha he gen­ der care gap is smaller in countries ha spend more over­ all on formal long-term care, such as Sweden, Belgium, or Switzerland. In contrast, countries with comparatively larger gender care gaps, such as Croatia or Greece, spend less on long-term care. Germany is again in he middle in both dimensions. This correlation becomes even more clear when only viewing expenditure on long-term in-patien care instead of otal expenditure on long-term care. While nearly two percen of GDP is spen on in-patien care in Sweden and Switzerland, Greece and Croatia spend only 0.07 and 0.15 per­ cen each. Germany spends around one percen of its GDP on long-term in-patien care, again landing i in",
      "he middle of he distribution compared o other European countries. When comparing he differences in in-patien care expend­ iture o he gender care gaps in he respective countries, a clear, statistically significan negative correlation emerges: On average, smaller gender differences in privately provided informal care can be observed in countries with more expend­ iture on long-term in-patien care (Figure 4). A he coun­ try level, his resul reflects he fac ha a stronger formal care system relieves caregiving relatives, especially women. However, i is questionable if his contributes o general gender equality, as here is a large share of women working in he professional care sector, where careers are frequently comparatively low paid.12 Gender care cap is lower when gender inequality is low The Gender Inequality Index (GEI) is used o investigate he correlation between he gender care cap and general gender inequality in he countries analyzed (Table in Box). The GEI includes differen domains of inequality ha are summarized into a single index between 1 (total inequality) and 100 (total equality). The results show ha he gender care gap is smaller in countries with higher gender equality across he differen domains (Figure 5).13 This correlation is clear in countries 12 OECD, “Women are well-represented in health and long-term care professions.” 13 This negative difference is no statistically significant, which could also be related o he small number of countries. The Gender Equality Index is available for all countries in Figure 1 excep for Switzerland, bringing he otal number of countries o 16.

This fac correlates positively with care work: The larger he relative difference in he employmen rate between men and women, he larger he gender care gap. This cor­ relation is especially clear when looking a Greece, Sweden, Portugal, and Switzerland. In Greece, he gender employ­ men rate gap is 30 percent. A he same ime, women in Greece are hree imes as likely as men o perform informal care work, which is a gender care gap of nearly 200 percent. In contrast, women are less han wice as likely o perform care work as men—a gender care gap of less han 100 per­ cent—in Sweden, Portugal, and Switzerland, where he dif­",
      "ference in he employmen rate is a maximum of 11 percent. Again, Germany is in he middle of he distribution here: The relative gender difference in he employmen rate is around en percen with a gender care gap of around 133 per­ cent. These results confirm, as expected, ha gender dif­ ferences in he labor marke are reflected in gender differ­ ences in informal care work and ha hese wo factors can be mutually dependent. such as Croatia, Greece, and Estonia: Each country’s GEI is around 50, which indicates high gender inequality com­ pared o he other countries. In hese hree countries, he gender care gap is over 170 percent. The counterexample is Sweden: I has he highes GEI (83) ogether with he hird smalles gender care gap (88 percent). Germany, again, is in the middle of he distribution with a GEI of 66 and a gen­ der care gap of around 133 percent. However, here are also exceptions o his correlation. For example, Portugal has a smaller gender pay gap bu a lower Gender Equality Index. Such exceptions show ha inequality in informal caretak­ ing duties between men and women can also be driven by other factors ha are no included in he GEI (Table in Box). One other importan gender difference is employmen rate inequality. The correlation between he gender care gap and differences in employmen pa erns between men and women are hus illustrated separately (Figure 6). Women’s labor marke participation depends on informal care work The lower he number of women employed in a country, the larger he gender care gap. A positive difference in he employmen rate means ha he labor marke participation Figure 4 Adjusted gender care gap and relative long-term in-patien care expenditure Gender Care Gap in percent, expenditure in percen of GDP Note: The line shown indicates he correlation between he adjusted gender care gap and relative expenditure on long-term care (measured as a percentage of GDP) based on a regression analysis.

However, here are importan differences between he countries ha are related o both expenditure on he formal care system and gender inequal­ ity: The more spen on formal care, he smaller he gender care gap, and countries with low gender inequality have a small gender care gap. Germany can learn from its neighbors with lower gender care gaps: In an international comparison, i is in he mid­ dle of he distribution when i comes o expenditure on for­ mal care, gender inequality, and he gender care gap. Germany should inves more in formal care o increase the number and quality of care offers as well as o reduce the amoun of informal care ha relatives mus provide. Currently, baby boomers are providing mos informal care. This will change in he future and in he medium erm when baby boomers stop acting as caregivers and begin requir­ ing care hemselves. Irrespective of he specific care work Box Data and sampling This Weekly Repor is based on Wave 6 (survey year 2015) of he Survey of Health, Ageing and Retiremen in Europe (SHARE).1 The sample is limited o respondents of a leas 50 years of age.2 This is done in order o investigate long-term care for adults and to distinguish i from childcare. Definition of care work In his study, only personal care (e.g., help with ge ing dressed, bathing or showering, eating meals, ge ing in or ou of bed, using the oilet) provided outside a person’s household and within he las welve months prior o he survey is considered care work. Care work provided within one’s own household is no considered as care work here, as both forms are captured differently in he data and are hus no comparable.3 Care provided by partners liv­ ing in he household is herefore no included. Other ypes of help provided for relatives or acquaintances, such as assistance with gardening or administrative ma ers, are no captured. On he one hand, his delineation clearly defines care as personal care suppor for another person and, on he other, ensures comparability with formal care services, such as care provided by an outpatien care service. The gender care gap is often calculated in he literature based on he number of hours spen caring for relatives daily.4 The underlying database does no contain any information on he daily use of ime (hours) spen on providing personal care. This Weekly Repor herefore measures whether he responden states ha they provide personal care for relatives (outside heir household). The SHARE data also records whether personal care is provided daily, weekly, or less frequently.",

Methodology The gender care gap describes he relative difference in he shares of women and of men providing informal care. In he firs step, country-specific, cross-sectionally weighted regressions are used to calculate he absolute differences in he shares of men and women providing informal care, controlling for age and he level of education. These are hen divided by he country-specific, weight­ ed share of all men providing care in order o calculate he relative gender care gap. The larger his gender care gap, he greater he gender inequality in he provision of informal care. In he second step, his relative gender care gap is regressed in­ dividually on he various country characteristics o investigate the respective statistical correlations between he gender care gap and various indicators of he national labor marke and care sys­ tem (Table in Box). As with he SHARE data, information from 2015 is used for he indicators.

This gap increases consistently when starting a family. A he beginning of he coronavirus pandemic in 2020, many feared ha he gender care gap may grow even larger. In fact, empirical analyses show ha gender differences in care work did increase in young families a he beginning of he pandemic, as primarily women ook on he extra childcare work brough on by closures of daycare facilities and schools. However, using data from he family panel pairfam, his Weekly Repor shows ha he gender care gap has since returned o its—albei still high—pre-pandemic level. If policymakers wan to effectively comba gender inequalities on he labor market, they should focus more on he unequal division of care work and dismantle existing barriers preventing a more equal divi­ sion.

Care work includes childcare, housework (cooking, cleaning, washing), repairs, and informal care of relatives.3 Countless studies over he years have investigated the gender care gap. 4 Recently, he Federal Statistical Office published data on he gender care gap in Germany mount­ ing o abou 44 percent.5 Considerable increase in gender care gap after becoming a parent Like he gender pay gap, he gender care gap is no he same across all age groups and increases from age 30 in particu­ lar.

While he share of couples dividing child­ care and housework equally remained nearly he same, he share of couples who indicated ha he mother performed (almost) all of hese asks increased. The share of couples in which hese asks were “primarily” performed by he mother decreased accordingly.11 Studies on other countries came o similar results (Box 2). Unequal division of care work declined o pre-pandemic level within one year Empirical studies based on data from winter 2020/2021, nearly a year into he pandemic, concluded ha couples were spli ing unpaid care work essentially he same as hey did before he pandemic (in 2019) (Figure 2).12 The larger share of couples in which he mother “(almost) entirely” ook over childcare and housework in he firs lockdown in 2020 was no longer observed in winter 2020/2021.

In 2019, before he coronavirus pandemic, he majority (59 percent) of respondents indicated ha childcare was provided primarily by he mother. In around 30 percen of cases, childcare was divided evenly. Less han nine percen of respondents indicated ha he mother was (almost) entirely responsible for childcare. In fewer han hree percen of all households in 2019 he father was (almost) entirely or pri­ marily providing childcare.",
      "Very similar pa erns were found for housework. In comparison, he division of childcare and housework in early summer 2020, i.e., during he firs survey after he beginning of he coronavirus pandemic, was more unequal. Particularly noticeable is he decline in he share of couples in which he mother was “primarily” responsible for child­ care and housework. In contrast, he share of couples in which he mother ook on childcare and housework “(almost) entirely” increased by almos he same exten (Figure 2). A detailed analysis of he changes in how couples divide care work shows ha some couples in which he mother was primarily responsible for hese duties before he pan­ demic also had a more equal division during he firs lock­ down (Figure 3). However, some couples who initially had a more equal division switched o a more unequal division in spring/summer 2020 in which primarily he mother ook on childcare and housework. Nine months later, in winter 2020/2021, he share of cou­ ples in which he mother ook care of childcare and house­ work “(almost) entirely” again declined markedly. Couples in which he mothers ook on almos all of he childcare a the beginning of he pandemic now divide childcare more equally. In addition, he share of couples dividing house­ work and childcare roughly equally increased again and was above he 2019 pre-pandemic level. The division of childcare duties remained nearly he same in winter 2021/2022 as well. Thus, he new data from winter 2021/2022 confirm he obser­ vation ha he division of childcare between mothers and fathers—following a brief more unequal division during he firs lockdown in 2020—has no changed significantly fol­ lowing he coronavirus pandemic. A similar picture emerges for housework: Although he share of couples in which he mother was (almost) entirely responsible for housework increased by hree percentage points, hese changes were no statistically significant. Overall, i canno be said with statistical certainty ha here have been any changes com­ pared o before he pandemic for any constellations of house­ work division. Conclusion: Large gender care gap in Germany, bu no lasting increase during he coronavirus pandemic Germany has a relatively large gender care gap compared o, for example, he Nordic countries, Sweden, Norway, Finland, and Denmark. This means ha women perform significantly more unpaid care work, such as childcare and housework, compared o men.

Each year, over 12,000 randomly selected people born between 1971 o 1973, 1981 o 1983, 1991 o 1993, and 2001 o 2003 (since 2019) cohorts participated in he pairfam survey. In the survey, respondents are asked o provide information abou themselves and heir family members, while he family members answer a less extensive survey. An additional survey was conducted in summer 2020 with he purpose of investigating societal changes following he corona- virus pandemic.2 The focus of he survey was on coronavirus-re­ lated changes o family life. All respondents who participated in he previous survey wave, or were only emporarily absent, participated in he additional survey. The regular pairfam survey was continued in he winters of 2020/2021 and 2021/2022. The analyses in his Weekly Repor are mainly based on he las regular survey before he pandemic (2018/2019), he additional corona­ virus pandemic survey, and he wo following survey waves. As gender differences are investigated, he analysis was limited o opposite-gender couples. The data include extensive information on socio-demographic characteristics of he respondents, heir employmen situation, and a itudes oward and details abou relationships. Furthermore, there are questions abou he division of labor in he partnership, the main opic of his Weekly Report. The survey question is: “How are you and your partner currently dividing he ime spen performing work in he following areas?” • Housework (washing, cooking, cleaning) • Shopping • House, apartment, or car repairs • Financial ma ers, dealing with authorities • Childcare [only households with children] Answer options are: • (Almost) entirely my partner • Primarily my partner • Abou 50/50 split • Primarily me • (Almost) entirely me The answers are recoded by gender in order o more directly inter- pre he responses of women and men, each of which make up 1 Cf.

      "responses from 2018/2019 are used as a reference period and deviations during and after he coronavirus pandemic are subse­ quently studied. The analyses on he effects of having children on he division of unpaid care work3 are based on all survey waves from 2008 o 2022. The dependen variable, i.e., differen constellations of care work division, is regressed on indicators for he years before and after he birth of he firs child. In addition, age and cohor effects are partialled out. The coefficients displayed hus show how he division of care work has changed relative o he reference period (two years before he birth of he firs child). As no childcare is per­ fomed before he birth of he firs child, he coefficients are natu­ rally se o zero before he birth of he firs child. In contrast, he division of household labor before he birth of he firs child is in­ dicated in he figures. The estimates are based on a otal of 19,665 observations of 5,840 respondents. The sample in he estimation is limited o couples who will either have a child in he following survey years or had a child in he previous waves. In he analysis of he division of care work before, during, and after the coronavirus pandemic,4 opposite-gender couples living o­ gether are observed in he corresponding four survey waves. The sample includes 7,352 observations based on 3,186 respondents. In both samples, 56 o 60 percen of he respondents are women. To depic he division of care work over he four survey waves around he pandemic and how his division changed from survey to survey, he sample is limited o households ha were observed in all four survey waves.5 This way, i can be ensured ha he periods between he surveys can be investigated.

However, his inequality declined back o its pre-pandemic level within he firs year of he pandemic. Recen data from he second year after he beginning of he pandemic confirm his finding. Thus, a major reversal of gender roles did no occur as a resul of he coronavirus pandemic as some had feared. The un equal division of unpaid care work between women and men in Germany did no become more unequal in he medium erm, bu instead remained a a high level. The gender care gap is associated with many gender gaps on he labor market. Gender inequalities increase in unpaid care work as well as on he labor marke when couples have children. If policymakers wan o reduce labor market-re­ lated gender inequalities such as he gender pay gap, hey need o also focus on closing he gender care gap.",
      "Numerous courses of action o create incentives for a more equal divi­ sion of paid and unpaid care work between women and men have been on he able for some ime. Expanding he num­ ber of partner months during parental allowance (Elterngeld), for example, could reduce he considerable inequality in care work following he birth of a child. Furthermore, reforming Ehega enspli ing (join axation of married couples with full income spli ing) and he ax reatmen of mini-job income could reduce he financial “part-time rap” for married women and hus lead o a more equal division of paid work and care work between women and men in he long erm.

In some OECD countries, such as South Korea, Japan, Mexico, and Turkey, he gender care gap is similar o he gap in Germany. However, he average gender care gap is smaller in many other European countries.1 Moreover, an especially large in­ crease in he gender care gap can be observed following he birth of a couple’s firs child in Germany compared o other countries.2 The effects of he coronavirus pandemic on he division of unpaid care work have been investigated in many countries. For example, studies from he U.S. show ha couples were dividing care work more equally in 2020 compared o before he pandemic. However, here oo here is an increased burden on mothers compared o fathers in erms of educating heir children and contempora­ neously managing both paid work and childcare. This burden occurred primarily due o daycare and school closures and could be observed in particular for parents with a low level of education and low income.3 This also resulted in differences in well-being between mothers and women withou children: Mothers with young children (up o and including primary school age) reported a greater psychological burden during he pandemic.4 1 OECD, Dare o Share – Deutschlands Weg zur Partnerschaftlichkei in Familie und Beruf ( Paris: 2017) (in German); Jacques Charmes, The Unpaid Care Work and he Labour Market.

Katharina Spieß, Katharina Wrohlich, and Elena Ziege ABSTRACT On average, mothers and fathers in Germany divide paid work and care work very unequally. Mothers often only work par time, which results in further gender inequalities in he labor market. A curren analysis of data from he German Family Demography Panel Study (FReDA) shows ha he popula­ tion’s a itudes oward he ideal division of work between couples with children under 12 are considerably more egalitar­ ian han he actual behavior of couples with young children of differen ages. This discrepancy is due in par o he financial incentives of he German ax and ransfer system for married couples, which arise from he interplay between income split­ ting (Ehega enspli ing) and he ax reatmen of mini-jobs. In addition, childcare infrastructure is insufficien and a very high gender pay gap persists in Germany. If policymakers wan o dismantle inequalities in he labor market, he ax and ransfer system mus be modernized and childcare options expanded to make a more equal division of paid work and care work between parents more appealing. In recen years, labor marke gender inequalities have increas­ ingly become he focus of public a ention and hus also of policy discussions. A he same ime, here are few meas­ urable advances in ackling hese inequalities in Germany. For example, he gender pay gap has remained a 18 per­ cent1 for many years and is very high in a European compari­ son.2 Empirical labor marke research shows ha parenthood exacerbates labor marke gender inequalities considerably. Countless studies on wha is known as he “child penalty” have shown ha he gender differences in gross hourly wages and hours worked— and hus gross yearly wages— increase considerably following he birth of a couple’s firs child and remain relatively constan a an older age.3 A major reason for he increase in labor marke gender ine­ qualities is due o paid work and care work: Following he birth of a couple’s firs child, he couple divides paid and care work less equally. For example, here are major differences between mothers and fathers when i comes o parental leave. Although he share of fathers aking parental leave has risen considerably over he pas 15 years, no leas in hanks o he introduction of parental benefits (Elterngeld) in 2007, he major­ ity still do",

More han 60 percen of all western German couples whose younges child is of preschool (three o five years old) or primary-school age (six o en years old) divide paid work according o his model (Figure 1), as do nearly fifty per­ cen of couples whose younges child is younger han hree. However, among couples with children in his age group, over 20 percen follow he male breadwinner model, in which he father is employed full ime and he mother does no work a all. In contrast, couples with older chil­ dren are significantly less likely o op for he male bread­ winner model a around only en percent. These figures are based on data from he German Family Demography Panel Study (FReDA), which is representative of he pop­ ulation in Germany aged 18 o 50 (Box 1). Around 12 o 16 percen of all western German couples with children are, depending on he age of he younges child, both employed full ime.

For example, he German Federal Government’s 2023 Repor on Fathers cites survey results according o which around half of all fathers state ha fathers and mothers should ideally each ake on half of childcare duties. However, his is only actually he case in 21 percen of families.

As par of FReDA, data on partnerships and family life is collected wice a year. An “anchor person” in he household as well as heir partner are surveyed. Overall, more han 30,000 interviews were conducted in fall 2023. FReDA includes questions on numerous demographic, psycholog­ ical, economic, and sociological aspects of life. Special a ention is paid o family planning and forms of cohabitation. Depending on he respondents’ family situation, parent-child relationships or intergenerational relationships are also addressed. The FReDA survey makes i possible o make international comparisons with numerous other countries in Europe and worldwide, as every hree years he questionnaire corresponds o ha of he Generations and Gender Survey (GGS).2 In 2022, he German Family Panel (pairfam) study was integrated into FReDA and continues on in his form. So far, data from he firs wo waves, conducted from 2021 o 2023, are available. The analyses are based on statements of he anchor person on their own employment, he employmen of heir partner, and heir own a itudes oward he employmen of parents from he firs wave in 2021. The question abou heir own employmen was “To wha exten are you employed? Are you...?” Answer options are: • Employed full ime • Employed par ime 1 FReDA stands for Family Research and Demographic Analysis. 2 Cf. he information on he Genations and Gender Survey (GGS) on he website of he Federal Institute for Population Research (Bundesinstituts für Bevölkerungsforschung) (in German; availa- ble online). • Marginally employed, in a mini-job, or a one-euro job The question abou he partner’s employmen is: “Has your partner performed paid work in he pas weeks?” with he following answer options: • Yes, paid work • Yes, paid work, bu hey are on vacation, parental leave, or similar • No, no paid work, bu looking for work • No, no paid work and no looking for work • I don’ know The question “How many hours does your partner normally work per week in his job or in his company, including overtime?” is used for people in paid employmen o differentiate between full- time and part-time employment. Full-time employmen is defined as working 35 hours or more per week. To find ou a itudes oward parental employment, he following question was asked: “Consider a family with a mother, father, and two children where he younges child is wo years old. Should he mother work full ime, par ime, or no work a all?” The question is repeated for he father and in wo other scenarios in which he younges child is four or eigh years old.

However, i is viewed as ideal by a significan share of respondents: Around 30 per­ cen of respondents in eastern and western Germany hink tha his is he ideal division of paid work for couples whose younges child is wo years old. If he younges child is four years old, more han 20 percen still consider i best. In he case of an eight-year-old child, 18 percen of respondents in western Germany and 15 percen of respondents in eastern Germany consider he dual earner/dual carer model as ideal. Overall, he analysis shows ha he share of respondents who find an egalitarian division of paid work (either in he adul worker model or he dual earner/dual carer model) o be ideal is considerably higher in eastern Germany, regardless of he age of he younges child, compared o he share of respond­ ents who prefer an unequal division. I is somewha differ­ en in western Germany, where respondents hink he male breadwinner model or one-and-a-half-earner model are he ideal arrangemen for couples whose younges child is either two or four years olds. However, if he younges child is eigh years old or older, he majority of western German respondents also hink ha an egalitarian division of paid work is ideal.8 Tax and ransfer system make he one-and-a-half earner model in particular financially a ractive There are countless individual reasons why he actual divi­ sion of paid and care work within couples deviates so much from he ideal. There may be working conditions ha make i impossible o work he desired number of hours or here may be structural restrictions, such as a lack of childcare spots. In addition, he financial incentives from he ax and rans­ fer system in Germany and he differen average wages of men and women influence couples’ employmen decisions. To illustrate hese financial incentives, we simulate he ne household income of five differen employmen combina­ tions for married couples. We assumed average gross hourly wages for men (25.30 euros) and women (20.80 euros) 9 for the simulations (Box 2). The simulated models are he male breadwinner model (father working full ime, mother unemployed), wo versions of he one-and-a-half-earner model (father working full ime, mother working either 20 hours or only marginally with six hours), he adul worker model (both parents working full time), and he dual earner/dual carer model (both parents working 30 hours a week). 8 Interestingly, men and women’s a itudes oward paid and care work are very similar, regard­ less of he age of he younges child. However, a larger share of women prefer he dual earner/ dual carer model compared o men, who end o prefer he adul worker model. 9 These values represen he average gross hourly wages of men and women in 2023. Cf. Statis­ tisches Bundesamt, “Gender Pay Gap 2023: Frauen verdienten pro Stunde 18 Prozen weniger als Männer.” Monthly ne household income",
      "is highes when both parents work full ime As expected, he ne household income is highes (4,861 euros per month) in he case of he adul worker model in which both parents work full ime (Figure 3). The one-and-a-half- earner model yields he second-highes monthly income (3,953 euros per month), slightly higher han he income from he dual earner/dual carer model (3,832 euros per month), despite he fac ha he parents work he same total number of weekly hours in both. However, because he assumed gross hourly wage of men is 18 percen higher han tha of women (the curren gender pay gap), he one-and-a- half-earner model yields a higher ne income. If he mother is in employmen only marginally for six hours a week, here is a significantly lower ne income of 3,440 per month. As expected, he ne household income is lowes with he male breadwinner model: only 2,941 euros per month.

Conclusion: Tax and ransfer system reforms could increase appeal of a more equal division of paid and care work General a itudes oward he division of paid and care work between couples with children deviate considerably from reality.

However, his model is empirically very rare.

If we divide he ne household income by he total number of hours worked by both parents, he income from he one-and-a-half-earner model in which he mother is marginally employed (six hours a week) is he highes a 17.30 euros ne per hour. This is closely followed by he male breadwinner model a 17 euros per hour. In he one- and-a-half-earner model in which he mother is employed par ime (20 hours per week) or in he dual earner/dual carer model, in which both parents work 30 hours per week, the ne income per hour worked is significantly lower a 15.20 euros and 14.70 euros per hour, respectively. I is he lowest, 14 euros per hour, when both parents are employed full ime (Figure 4). When using he adul worker model as a reference model and comparing he otal work hours of both parents and he ne household income with he other models, i becomes evident: The one-and-a-half-earner model with he mother employed in a mini-job (six hours a week) results in he household earning 71 percen of he ne income of he reference household, while only having o work 57 percen of he otal hours worked by he reference household.

      "Income, work, and health satisfaction differ primarily by household income, age, and parental status By Laura Buchinger, Theresa Entringer, and Daniel Graeber ABSTRACT Subjective well-being is essential for both quality of life and a healthy society. Studies have shown ha satisfied people have be er relationships, are more productive, and have a longer life expectancy. General life satisfaction is being discussed as an alternative measure of prosperity beyond GDP. Thus, find­ ings on his opic are relevan for both he scientific commu­ nity as well as policymakers. This Weekly Repor investigates the income, work, and health satisfaction of he German popu­ lation from 2004 o 2021. Using data from he Socio-Economic Panel, we investigate if here are differences in satisfaction between genders, regions (east/west), age groups, parental status, and income groups. The analysis shows ha general life satisfaction as well as income, work, and health satisfac­ tion have either increased or remained constan since 2004. However, differences between groups, some quite significant, still remain, especially in erms of health satisfaction. Com­ paratively, low-income earners and parents are dissatisfied. To counter his, policy measures o unburden parents and improve he childcare system are needed. Subjective well-being has a significan impac on he quality of life in a society. Psychological and medical studies have shown ha people who are more satisfied have be er rela­ tionships,1 are more productive a work,2 and even have a longer life expectancy.3 Subjective well-being is also a opic of research in economics.4 The discussion around subjective well-being as a measure of human progress is being revived as he suitability of GDP as a measure of human progress is being questioned due o climate change and increasingly scare resources.5 Findings on he subjective well-being of he German population are hus extremely relevan for both sci­ ence and policymakers. The literature differentiates between affective well-being— the frequency with which people experience positive and neg­ ative feelings—and cognitive well-being, how people eval­ uate heir life overall compared o heir ideal vision of it.6 Studies capture cognitive well-being by estimating general life satisfaction as well as satisfaction in individual domains. While he majority of he literature focuses on general life satisfaction, here are relatively few studies on satisfaction with differen life domains. This Weekly Repor contributes to he literature by analyzing inequalities in satisfaction in three differen domains: personal income, work, and health. Work is a key par of life for mos adults, and work satisfac­ tion hus plays an importan role in he well-being of mos adults in Germany. The same applies o satisfaction with personal income; income enables social participation and 1 Shannon More and Ed Diener, “Types of subjective well-being and heir associations with rela­ tionship outcomes,” Journal of Positive Psychology and Wellbeing 3, no. 2 (2019): 112–118. 2 Jesús F. Salgado and Silvia Moscoso, “Cross-cultural evidence of he relationship between subjective well-being and job performance: A meta-analysis,” Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology 38, no. 1 (2022): 27–42 (available online; accessed on August 1, 2024.

      "There are also differences between eas and wes Germany. For example, people in eas Germany are considerably more dissatisfied with heir personal income compared o peo­ ple in wes Germany. The average value in eas Germany was 4.9 points in 2004 compared o an average 5.7 points in wes Germany. By 2021, he personal income satisfaction gap between eas and wes Germany had shrunk consider­ ably. In 2021, eas Germans (6.7) were nearly as satisfied as wes Germans (6.9). The pay gap between eas and west, which has become smaller over he years, may be relevan here. While he gross hourly wage in eas Germany was only around 75 percen of he gross hourly wage in wes Germany in 2004, i had increased o around 87 percen in 2021.14 In regards o age, people below 30 were considerably less sat­ isfied with heir personal income (4.9) han people above 30 (5.7), although he gap has decreased over he years. In 2021, for example, younger adults’ personal income satisfaction was 6.5, while i was 6.9 for older adults over 30. People who are finishing raining or an apprenticeship or who recently began heir professional career were increasingly more sat­ isfied with heir personal income. One possible reason for this could be how he labor marke has changed over he las 20 years. The early 2000s were characterized by unem­ ploymen and limited labor marke prospects, especially for young people.15 By 2022, half of all companies were affected by a shortage of skilled professionals.16 This is likely o have had a positive impac on starting salaries and he general labor marke for young people. This was hen possibly also reflected in young people’s income satisfaction. In erms of household income, he respondents are divided into hree groups of equal size and compared: he lowes income earners (firs ercile), he middle-income earners (second ercile), and he highes income earners (third er­ cile). Unsurprisingly, personal income satisfaction differs 13 OECD, “Gender Wage Gap,” (2024) (available online; accessed on June 20, 2024.) Relative dif­ ferences in he mean values (median) are reported. 14 Jannik André Nauerth and Johan Pflanz, “Lohnlücke Ost-Wes – Ewige Disparitä oder schiefer Vergleich?” Ifo Dresden berichte 30, no. 5 (2023): 8–13. 15 Sandra Buchholz und Karin Kurz, “Increasing employmen instability among young people?

While hese differences are considerable, he gaps did narrow o some exten in 2021: The gap between",

A he same ime, younger peo­ ple often do no ye have any additional family responsibili­ ties and may herefore no require as much flexibility from their employers. The greates differences in work satisfaction are between the groups with differen household incomes. Low-income earners (firs ercile) were he mos dissatisfied with work, followed by middle-income earners and high-income earn­ ers (second and hird erciles). The differences were great­ es between he lowes and middle income erciles. The dif­ ference was around 0.5 points in 2004 bu had sunk o 0.3 points by 2021, and he gap between he middle and high­ es incomes sank from 0.4 o 0.2. One possible explanation for his is ha people from he bo om hird of earners more frequently have jobs with poor working conditions, such as shif work, li le schedule flexibility, and significan physi­ cal and mental burdens. These are factors ha have been proven o negatively affec work satisfaction.20 Similar o gender, no significan differences can be found between people with and withou children over he obser­ vation period. Men have higher health satisfaction han women On average, men were more satisfied with heir health han women (Figure 4): While men reported health satisfaction of 6.6 points in 2004, women reported only 6.3. The ime series of he wo ran almos parallel until 2020. In 2021, both values increased by around 0.3 points, likely an effec of he corona­ virus pandemic. Thus, men report, on average, ha hey are in be er health han women. Moreover, studies show ha men go o he doctor less frequently and are also less likely to be absen from work due o illness.21 However, men die earlier and are more affected by some common diseases han women. A he same ime, women suffer more frequently from some hormone-related physical and mental illnesses, especially in relation o he menstrual cycle, pregnancy, birth, and menopause. Thus, when observing differen indicators of health, i is often unclear whether women or men are health­ ier. Differing gender norms could also explain he continu­ ing gap in health satisfaction between men and women. For example, studies have shown ha mos people find i socially inacceptable for men o alk abou heir health problems.22 There are also ongoing differences between people with and withou children: On average, parents were more dissatisfied with heir health (6.2 in 2004) han people withou children 20 Sarah A.

      "people withou children increasing in particu­ lar (7.3 compared o 6.7 for parents). As parenthood is associ­ ated with stress factors, such as less and worse sleep,23 rela­ tionship problems,24 less ime for relaxation,25 and finan­ cial issues,26 his is no surprising. Numerous studies have already shown ha many people are less satisfied with heir physical or mental health after becoming parents.27 Differences between eas and wes Germany have lessened over ime: People in eas Germany were more dissatisfied with heir health han people in wes Germany. In 2004, he difference was 0.4 points and by 2021, i had shrunk o only 0.1 points. Many eas Germans have fragmented employ­ men histories due o heir experiences post-reunification. A he same ime, significan health differences between people of high and low socioeconomic status, for example approximated by employmen status, are well documented in he scientific literature.28 Compared o people over 30, people under 30 were 1.4 points more satisfied with heir health on average in 2004. Surprisingly, his difference had been steadily decreasing until 2021; ha year, he difference was only 1.1 points. One explanation for his convergence could be ha he state of health in old age is steadily improving across birth cohorts.29 When looking a he differen household income groups, peo­ ple from he bo om hird were he leas satisfied with heir health, followed by people from he middle hird, while he highes income earners were he mos satisfied with heir health. The gaps between he groups were around 0.4 points each and have remained relatively constan over he years. This may reflec he well-documented socio-economic dif­ ferences in health in Germany.30 23 David Richter e al., “Long-term effects of pregnancy and childbirth on sleep satisfaction and duration of first-time and experienced mothers and fathers,” Sleep 42, no. 4 (2019): zsz015. 24 Manon A. van Scheppingen e al., “Self-Esteem and Relationship Satisfaction During he Tran­ sition o Motherhood,” Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 114, no. 6 (2018): 973–991. 25 Amy Claxton and Maureen Perry-Jenkins, “No Fun Anymore: Leisure and Marital Quality Across he Transition o Parenthood,” Journal of Marriage and Family 70, no. 1 (2008): 28–43. 26 Ma hias Pollmann-Schult, “Parenthood and Life Satisfaction: Why Don’ Children Make People Happy?” Journal of Marriage and Family 76, no. 2 (2014): 319–336. 27 Michael D.

In essence, there are hree main motives for sending remi ances: altru­ ism, strategic or investmen reasons, and social and cul­ tural bonds.12 These motivations can overlap and reflec dif­ feren needs and circumstances, which can vary depend­ ing on he migrants’ individual situation and he nature of their migration. Altruistic motives A key motive for sending remi ances is altruism, he desire to suppor relatives in need. This motive drives more remit­ tances during crisis periods in migrants’ home countries in particular, when families are faced with economic challenges, political instability, or natural disasters. In such cases, remit­ tances are vital aid o secure basic needs such as food, medi­ cal care, and education.13 This form of assistance is common among both migrants withou a refugee background as well as refugees, although he la er may be under particular pres­ sure o provide financial suppor due o heir refugee situ­ ation and he often precarious situation of heir families.14 Strategic or investmen motives Remi ances are strategic investments for some migrants, especially hose who are economically stable. Remi ances are used o acquire or maintain assets in heir home coun­ try, such as real estate or family businesses. Generally, he goal is o secure long-term sources of income or o ensure a possible return.15 This is generally a",

On he one hand, his find­ ing exposes he contradictory nature of he political debate, which focuses on remi ances sen by refugees and resulted in he introduction of he paymen card system in various fed­ eral states, among other hings, withou empirical evidence of its benefits. Secondly, his finding emphasizes he need for a more in-depth analysis o shed ligh on he connections between remi ances and he specific, diverse living condi­ tions of migrants (such as heir differen employmen situ­ ations). For such an analysis, data collection on remi ances mus also be improved, as central banks in particular often fail o adequately record informal financial flows. Advanced techniques, such integrating differen data sources and mul­ tiple imputation, could provide more accurate figures and thus create a reliable basis for economic policy decisions. Furthermore, i is crucial o recognize he value of remit­ tances as an informal bu importan form of economic sup­ port.29 Remi ances abroad, which are often sen for personal reasons, contribute significantly o he economic stability of families in low and middle-income countries according to studies. Remi ances are often more effective han finan­ cial resources from developmen cooperation, as hey reach those in need directly withou losing money due o bureau­ cracy or corruption. In his way, remi ances make an impor­ tan contribution o reducing poverty and economic resil­ ience.30 Migrants’ remi ances abroad can be considered a driving force in promoting he United Nations Sustainable Developmen Goals (SDGs), as hey improve he living con­ ditions of families and communities. Remi ances make i possible for migrants o suppor heir families back home, an action in line with he SDG framework,31 which empha­ sizes he righ of every person o freely spend heir income, regardless of where heir relatives live.

In February 2024, he maximum length of his exclusion period was increased from 18 o 36 months. This increase may",
      "double he actual waiting ime, which is currently already more han one year, as data from he Socio-Economic Panel show. This particularly affects refugees with a low level of education and li le knowledge of German. A longer waiting time no only negatively impacts he health of affected individ­ uals bu is also disadvantageous for he state; late reatmen often requires more expensive reatment. Thus, shortening he period would have been more sensible han increasing it. The electronic health insurance card (EHIC) for refugees makes access o health services during his waiting period easier, as i reduces administrative barriers. However, jus under 20 per­ cen of all refugees have an EHIC, as he system has no been introduced in all federal states. The electronic health insur­ ance card should be introduced nationwide in order o cushion the negative effects of extended restrictions on health care. A he end of February 2024, he maximum period ha a refugee is excluded from health care services under he Asylbewerberleistungsgesetz (Asylum Seekers’ Benefits Act, AsylbLG) was increased from 18 o 36 months. The AsylbLG regulates he amoun and ype of social benefits asylum seek­ ers receive before hey are entitled o he citizen’s benefi (Bürgergeld) and other social benefits. According o calcu­ lations on draf legislation by he CDU/CSU Parliamentary Group,1 such an extension should resul in savings “in he three-digi million range annually.” This draf legislation was preceded by an agreemen between he federal and state gov­ ernments on a series of measures o reduce incentives for refugees o migrate o Germany as well as he costs incurred by state and local authorities, including increasing he exclu­ sion period of he AsylbLG. However, he actual effects of such a change o he AsylbLG have no been discussed in detail. In his Weekly Report, health care will be used as an example o show how increasing he AsylbLG’s exclusion period affects he health and integration of refugees as well as he financing of health care.2 The effec of introducing he electronic health insurance card (EHIC) for refugees in his legal contex is also explored. Asylum seekers, refugees with exceptional leave o remain (Geduldete), and refugees required o leave he country (Ausreisepflichtige) have limited healthcare entitlements com­ pared o social welfare recipients. By he end of February 2024, this exclusion period lasted 18 months; until September 2019, i was only 15 months. According o Section 4 of he AsylbLG, refugees are entitled o reatmen for “acute illnesses and pain,” vaccinations and medically required check-ups as well as pregnancy and birth. Further services can be pro­ vided on an individual basis according o Section 6 as long as 1 Deutscher Bundestag, “Gesetzentwurf der Fraktion CDU/CSU. Entwurf eines Gesetzes zur Weiterentwicklung des Asylbewerberleistungsgesetzes (Asylbewerberleistungsweiterentwick­ lungsgesetz – AsylbLWG),” Bundestags-Drucksache 20/9309 (2023) (in German; available online. Accessed on February 28, 2024. This applies o all other online sources in his repor unless stated otherwise). 2 This Weekly Repor uses he word refugees. This refers o all people who have",
      "submi ed an asylum claim in Germany regardless of he result. Thus, his includes people in he middle of heir asylum claim as well as people with a positive or negative (such as exceptional leave o remain or a requiremen o leave he country) asylum decision. Ukrainian refugees are no affected by he Asylbewerberleistungsgesetz and are hus no included in he analysis. 99 DIW Weekly Repor 12/2024 ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE they are “vital o ensuring [...] health.” With regard o health care, he AsylbLG offers considerable scope for discretion, as neither “acute pain conditions” according o Section 4 nor the “indispensability” of care according o Section 6 are pre­ cisely defined. I is herefore up o he responsible doctors o assess he situation and he social security offices o decide whether hey will approve reimbursement.3 This results in considerable inequality in refugees’ realized access o health care.4 I is clear, however, ha refugees mus initially expec considerable health care restrictions after heir arrival in Germany. Refugees have he same entitlements o health care services as social welfare recipients only after he end of he AsylbLG exclusion period5 or once heir asylum claim has been approved (SGB XII, Figure 1). The introduction of he AsylbLG in 1993 was accompanied by a change in health care financing from he health insur­ ance companies o he municipalities and hus required a new billing structure. Health care vouchers were introduced for his purpose: Before a doctor’s appointment, a refugee mus apply for a health care voucher from he responsi­ ble social security office. The social security office reviews adherence o he AsylbLG as well as he medical necessity of he doctor’s appointment. This process leads o unnec­ essary delays in reatmen and is viewed as a barrier o care 3 Amand Führer, “Determinanten der Gesundhei und medizinischen Versorgung von Asyl­ suchenden in Deutschland,” Bundesgesundheitsbla no. 10 (2023): 1083–91 (available online). 4 Oliver Razum, Judith Wenner, and Kayvan Bozorgmehr, “Wenn Zufall über den Zugang zur Ge­ sundheitsversorgung bestimmt: Geflüchtete in Deutschland,” Das Gesundheitswesen, no. 11 (2016): 711–714 (in German; available online). 5 The exclusion period of he AsylbLG has also been he subjec of reform discussions in he pas and has been changed several imes. Until September 2019, he period was 15 months. Be­ tween 2007 and 2015 i was 48 months, between 1997 and 2007 i was 36 months, and between 1993 and 1997 i was 12 months. by patients and doctors.6 In addition o he considerable amoun of administrative work required, medical laypeo­ ple are acting as gatekeepers o he health care system.7 An alternative system using an electronic health insurance card (EHIC) was introduced in Bremen for he firs ime in 2005 (Box 1). Currently, he EHIC has been introduced comprehen­ sively in six states: Berlin, Brandenburg, Bremen, Hamburg, Thuringia, and Schleswig-Holstein. The EHIC has also been introduced in individual districts and municipalities in hree other states (Figure 2). The 2019 change o he AsylbLG’s exclusion period and he gradual introduction",
      "of he EHIC since 2005 have resulted in differing health care entitlements for refugees depending on he place of residence and year. In addition, he entitle­ ments depend on he processing ime of he asylum claim, which has varied over he pas years and by he applicant’s country of origin. The number of refugees with exceptional leave o remain also plays a role, as hey are subjec o he AsylbLG regulations even after heir asylum process has been completed.8 Due o hese circumstances, i is currently unclear how long refugees actually had o wai for full health care entitlements. To assess he consequences of extending he exclusion period to 36 months, we mus look a how many refugees are actually affected by such an extension. Tha is, how many individuals 6 Anke Spura e al., “Wie erleben Asylsuchende den Zugang zu medizinischer Versorgung?” Bundesgesundheitsbla 60 (2017): 462–470 (in German; available online). 7 Führer, “Determinanten der Gesundhei und medizinischen Versorgung von Asylsuchenden in Deutschland.” 8 Many refugees whose asylum claim is rejected are granted an exceptional leave o remain, as returning o heir home country is no possible for various reasons. In recen years, he share of people whose asylum claim has been rejected who have been given exceptional leave o remain has consistently been around 80 percent.

Furthermore, i is unclear who is affected by long waiting imes: The length of he asylum process var­ ies depending on he applicant’s country of origin, meaning tha he actual waiting ime for regular health care entitle­ ments can vary greatly for certain groups of refugees. The burden of disease, especially for chronic illnesses, is higher among older refugees, women, or refugees with a low level of education and hese groups hus have a higher need for health services.9 If hese groups experience very long wait­ ing imes, hey experience a double hardship: No only are they ill more often and more acutely, bu hey also experi­ ence additional barriers in accessing he health care system. Some states have introduced he EHIC for refugees o sim­ plify administrative access o health care during he AsylbLG exclusion period. However, i is currently unclear who he EHIC benefits.

Box 1 Electronic health insurance card for refugees The electronic health insurance card for refugees makes i possible for refugees o use health care services legally with­ ou a health care voucher. Refugees receive a chip card ha they can use o receive health care services directly in he same way as he statutorily insured via a framework agree­ men between state authorities and a health insurance pro­ vider. To his end, a range of services is defined in advance a state level ha complies with he AsylbLG.1 The costs of med­ ical care are covered by he municipality, bu he services are cheaper, as he municipalities now are subjec o he health insurance providers’ cos catalog.2 The health care companies receive an administrative fee per chip card for heir efforts; this is en euros per month per person in Hamburg, for exam­ ple.3 The EHIC makes access o health care easier by remov­ ing bureaucratic obstacles for both patients and doctors, by creating clarity abou he scope of health care services, and by minimizing waiting imes associated with he health care voucher system. In addition o he benefits for he municipalities, he introduc­ tion of he EHIC has significan benefits for he general health status and mental health of refugees.4 These benefits are espe­ cially eviden for refugees with language barriers.5 In addition, the introduction of he EHIC results in higher utilization of pri­ mary care6 while lowering utilization of emergency care.7 1 In practice, negotiating a benefits catalog with he health insurance providers often means ha he restrictions of he AsylbLG are less severe in regions with he EHIC and, with a few exceptions, correspond o he benefits catalog of he statutory health insurance com­ panies, see Marcel Wächter­Raquet, Einführung der Gesundheitskarte für Asylsuchende und Flüchtlinge.

Refugees’ have an average waiting ime of over one year before receiving full health care entitlements Overall, refugees who were living in Germany in 2021 waited over one year (376 days) until hey received full health care entitlements. Sixty-four percen of he refugees had o wai for the end of he AsylbLG exclusion period,10 whereas 36 percen were granted regular entitlements earlier due o heir asylum claim being accepted. Thus, he majority of refugees experi­ ence a long exclusion period under he AsylbLG (Figure 3). There are sligh bu statistically significan differences between men and women in he waiting period until full health care entitlements. On average, women had o wai 17 days longer han men (Figure 4). Refugees with a low 10 A his ime: 15 or 18 months. level of education also had o wai longer: On average, hey waited 24 days longer han refugees with a medium level of education. 36-month exclusion period likely o increase disadvantages for refugees with a low level of education and li le knowledge of German If refugees who were living in Germany in 2021 had had a waiting ime of 36 months instead of 18 (or 15), hey would have waited an additional 352 days on average before receiv­ ing regular health care entitlements. Fifty-two percen of he refugees would have had o wai for he end of he AsylbLG’s exclusion period—so 36 months—whereas 48 percen would have received earlier access due o heir asylum claim being accepted. A hypothetical validity period of 36 months greatly exacerbates the differences in waiting imes: Refugees with a low level of education would have o wai around hree months longer than refugees with an intermediate or high level of educa­ tion (Figure 5). Refugees with li le or intermediate knowl­ edge of German would have also had o wai around wo months longer han refugees who understand German well.

      "insurance card. The gradual introduc­ tion of he EHIC since 2005 has resulted in easier access o health care services for a otal of 17 percen of all refugees. Seven percen of refugees had full access o he health care system a he poin of introduction and could hus no ben­ efi from he EHIC although hey lived in a region where i was in use (Figure 6). Thus, so far only very few refugees or municipalities have been able o benefi from he intro­ duction of he EHIC (Box 1). The majority of refugees mus face he uncertainty, extra effort, and reatmen delays asso­ ciated with he health care voucher system. In addition, regional coverage of he EHIC is associated with inequality in regard o he refugees’ level of education: Thirty-four percen of refugees with a high level of educa­ tion live in a region with he EHIC. However, only 22 and 23 percen of refugees with an intermediate or low level of education, respectively (Figure 6), live in a region with he EHIC. Like he maximum exclusion period of he AsylbLG, the administrative regulations in he states resul in a sys­ tematic health disadvantage for refugees with a low level of education, although his group generally has a higher bur­ den of disease and already faces greater obstacles in access­ ing health care services. Longer exclusion period from healthcare entitlements: Hope for cos savings is shor sighted The actual waiting ime until regular health care entitle­ ments is already significan and will more han double by expanding he AsylbLG exclusion period o 36 months. I is short-sighted o assume ha limiting health care services will save money. In contrast, studies show ha limiting ref­ ugees’ health care is more cost-intensive in he long run.11 This is because limiting health care access increased he chance ha emergency or intensive reatmen is required. Early intervention in primary care, on he other hand, can preven expensive hospital stays, complex diagnostic proce­ dures, and serious disease progression.12 The argumen of cos savings is also short-sighted, as i ignores he consequences of poor health on refugees’ social and economic participation. I is well documented ha seri­ ous illness restricts a person’s ability o participate in educa­ tional opportunities, find and keep a job, ake care of heir family, and participate in social activities.13 No addressing 11 Kayvan Bozorgmehr and Oliver Razum, “Effec of Restricting Access o Health Care on Health Expenditures among Asylum­Seekers and Refugees: A Quasi­Experimental Study in Germany, 1994–2013,” PLoS ONE 10 (2015): (available online). 12 Aldo Rosano e al., “The relationship between avoidable hospitalization and accessibility o primary care: a systematic review,” European Journal of Public Health (2013): 356–360 (available online). 13 Maria K.

For his analysis, however, days are used as he measure by using he midpoin of each month (the 15th day). I is assumed ha he arrival of refugees is evenly distributed over he month, so a correc average number of days is calculated with a sufficiently large sample size. An advantage o using days instead of months is ha distortions can be avoided if this information is linked with legislative changes, as hese often happen a he beginning of a month. In order o evaluate he waiting ime under a hypothetical ex­ pansion of he exclusion period of he AsylbLG o 36 months, data on he date of arrival in Germany and he date he asylum claim was approved are similarly linked. However, in his case, a waiting ime of 36 months is determined if he asylum claim was no approved within he firs 36 months. Otherwise, he ime until approval is considered as he waiting ime.

These are linked with he date of introduction in he respective federal states, counties, or munic­ ipalities.3 A survey responden could benefi from he electronic health insurance card if hey lived in a region with he EHIC and its introduction happened before hey received regular access o the health care system (before he expiry of he AsylbLG exclusion period or he asylum claim). To investigate inequalities in regard o people with a special need for health care, he calculated waiting ime and EHIC coverage are considered separately according o four characteristics: gender (male/female), age group (17–29/30–49/50+), level of education in home country based on he ISCED-11 classification (low/medi­ um/high), and German language skills, with speaking, writing and reading skills each recorded on a scale of 1-5, summed, and hen tertiles of he otal score formed (low/medium/high).

This is a clear violation of he righ o health, o which Germany has com­ mi ed itself by ratifying he UN International Covenan on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.17 The restrictions are often justified by heir emporary nature, bu he long pro­ cessing ime of asylum claims in Germany, he high asylum claim acceptance rate, and he high share of refugees with exceptional leave o remain mean ha he restrictions affec the people who remain in Germany for long periods of ime. Moreover, he health care restrictions resul in negative health outcomes for refugees in he short-term, as well as incurring long-term costs for he state if delayed reatmen results in high costs for emergency or intensive care. Instead of creating additional legal barriers for refugees, access o the health care system should be made easier, for example through low-threshold health care provision in refugee shel­ ters,18 he nationwide introduction of he EHIC o remove administrative barriers,19 and appropriate interpretation and translation services.20 The introduction of he EHIC for refugees offers significan health and economic benefits, bu is insufficiently imple­ mented.

This is likely o be the case for “top-ups” (employed low-income individuals also receiving he citizen’s benefit) in par­ ticular, who have a low entitlemen o benefits due o heir income). In these groups, he number of hardship cases with larger burdens increases only slightly (Figure 1). The Gini coeffi­ cien for income inequality declines minimally more han withou he reduction (Table). Conclusion: Climate dividend urgently needed, especially for low-income households Carbon pricing for fossil and heating fuels is a key instru­ men for achieving German and European climate argets. Withou a broad redistribution of revenue from carbon pric­ ing o households, i has a regressive effec on he income distribution because i burdens low-income households rel­ ative o heir income more han above-average and high- income earners. If here is a considerable increase in carbon pricing, which is expected during he ransition o he EU-ETS2, he intro­ duction of a climate dividend will be all he more urgent, a leas for low-income households. After all, many low-in­ come households do no have heir heating costs covered by he basic income scheme or do no receive he housing benefi despite being eligible due o a lack of information and bureaucratic application procedures. The same applies to subsidy programs for decarbonization. Paying a climate dividend o he entire population entails a high fiscal burden for which here is no ye leeway in he Climate and Transformation Fund (KTF). This would require funding programs o be cu funds o be made available from the federal budget. A flat-rate per capita climate dividend paid o all residents would also relieve above-average and high-income earners. These groups are less strongly affected by carbon pricing and generally have more opportunities o reduce heir fos­ sil fuel energy consumption. These opportunities are sup­ ported generously by subsidy programs, which also mostly have a strongly regressive effect. Therefore, i makes sense to concentrate he climate dividend on low and middle-in­ come households in he long erm, so long as i is echni­ cally and politically feasible. Since determining each resident’s income and adjusting he climate dividend individually per person would be oo ime consuming, axing he climate dividend is a good option, as i can be done so unbureaucratically. The application of a specific ax rate function makes i possible for lower and middle-income households o receive he full climate div­ idend while i is reduced significantly for higher-income households. The funds freed up his way can be used for additional aid and suppor programs for decarbonization, especially for “vulnerable” households with low incomes and higher energy consumption. This could contribute o increasing societal acceptance for noticeable carbon cos increases as well as societal suppor for an ambitious climate policy. 259 DIW Weekly Repor 43+44/2024 CLIMATE DIVIDEND JEL: Q41, D31, H23 Keywords: carbon pricing, climate dividend, redistribution Stefan Bach is a Research Associate in he Public Economics",

      "Refugees send remi ances abroad less often han other migrants By Adriana Cardozo Silva and Sabine Zinn ABSTRACT Remi ances sen by refugees o heir home countries has been a hotly debated policy opic in Germany over he pas years and has led o he introduction of a paymen card for asylum applicants. This Weekly Repor investigates how he share of people living in Germany who send remi ances abroad has changed over ime according o heir migration background (with or withou a refugee background) and which factors influence he likelihood of remi ing. Based on Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) data as well as he IAB-SOEP Migration Samples and he IAB-BAMF-SOEP Refugee Survey from 2013 o 2022, he analysis shows ha migrants withou a refugee background send remi ances more often, while refugees are often rarely able o send remi ances due o structural barriers. Thus, he political debate does no reflec reality. A person’s family situation and heir intention o stay in Germany long erm are particularly importan factors influenc­ ing he likelihood ha hey will send remi ances abroad. In this respect, hese results should contribute o a reevaluation of remi ances, as hey are an importan instrumen in achiev­ ing sustainable developmen goals, in stabilizing he economy in he migrants’ home countries, and reducing poverty. In recen decades, he volume of he global flow of remit­ tances sen by migrants has grown significantly and reached historic peaks. According o World Bank data based on cal­ culations by central banks around he world, hese remit­ tance flows have developed into a significan income source for many low and middle-income countries. These personal transfers, referred o hereafter interchangeably as “personal transfers” or “remi ances,” help millions of families mee their basic needs and make an importan contribution o local economic development.1 Germany is also par of his global trend: Since he 2000s, he country has recorded a continu­ ing increase of remi ances sen abroad (Figure 1). By 2023, Germany was one of he op European nations in remit­ tances sent, reaching over 24 billion dollars (22 billion euros). This developmen reflects he change in migration ­dynamics tha Germany has experienced over he pas wo decades. Since 2000, he share of he population with a migration background2 has risen steadily. As of 2022, i was around 25 percen of he population, or around 21 million people. This increase is due both o he arrival of skilled migrants as well as of asylum seekers from crisis regions such as Syria, Afghanistan, and Ukraine. As of 2023, a new record of around 3.2 million asylum seekers are living in Germany.3 This situ­ ation reflects Germany’s humanitarian commitment, bu has also led o more debate on migration policy. Critical voices demand stricter regulations, especially regarding accepting asylum seekers. One key argumen in his discussion is he 1 Dilip Ratha et al., Remi ances Slowed in 2023, Expected o Grow Faster in 2024 (Washington, DC: World Bank, 2024) (available online. Accessed on November 2,",

This applies o all other online sources in his repor unless stated otherwise). 2 This Weekly Repor does no differentiate between direc (born abroad) and indirec migration (a leas one paren born abroad) backgrounds. Instead, both groups are considered migrants. We only differentiate between non-migrants and migrants (with and withou a refugee background). The definition of migrants and heir offspring is based on differen characteristics ha are avail­ able in he SOEP dataset, such as country of birth, country of origin, year of migration, and oth­ er information abou heir migration, cf.

This presumption has already led o concrete regulatory measures: For example, a paymen card system has been introduced, which limits asylum seekers’ access o disposable cash.4 The goal of his measure is o control he use of state subsidies more strictly and o ensure ha refu­ gees are mainly using his money o suppor hemselves in Germany.5 However, his debate ignores he positive effects tha remi ances sen abroad have on he recipien countries.6 The increase in remi ances and he related policy reactions emphasize he opic’s complexity: They illustrate how closely related economic aspects of migration and social policy chal­ lenges and public discourse are. While hese remi ances are of grea significance for he recipien countries, hos socie­ ties face he challenge of addressing unsubstantiated con­ cerns abou public funds flowing abroad, while also ensur­ ing suppor and integration for refugees. However, he aggregated figures published by he World Bank, which use Bundesbank data for Germany, do no pro­ vide any insigh into he amounts sen by migrants, especially refugees, and non-migrants (Box).

The gross income including he employer’s social security contributions is recorded. • Personal ransfers (PT): Includes all monetary or in-kind rans­ fers sen abroad by people living in Germany, independen of their relationship o he recipient.2 In Germany, ransfer data is mainly collected via banks. Transfers of smaller amounts (under 12,500 euros) and informal remi ances are frequently no included, which can resul in he actual remit­ tance volume being underestimated. In addition, he data can include remi ances made by Germans withou a migration back­ ground. Furthermore, here are challenges in recording informal and digital remi ances. SOEP data and methodology The German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) data used in his Weekly Repor can provide some of his more detailed informa­ tion for Germany.

Migrants send remi ances abroad more often than refugees To understand he heoretical motives for remi ing in practice, we firs describe he developmen of he share of people who send personal ransfers abroad using SOEP data from 2013 to 2022. Next, statistical models shed ligh on he characteris­ tics ha are associated with a higher likelihood of remi ing. Although remi ances abroad are mainly associated with migrants, non-migrants (Germans withou a migration background) also send personal ransfers o other coun­ tries. In recen years, between hree and four percen of all people living in Germany sen remi ances abroad (Figure 2), as well as around 1.5 percen of non-migrants. However, SOEP data only provide limited information on he amounts non-migrants send abroad or for wha specific reasons hey are remi ing. I is unclear whether hey send remi ances 17 Anna Lindley, “The early-morning phonecall: Remi ances from a refugee diaspora perspec­ tive,” Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies 35, no. 8 (2009) (available online).

Marital status is also an influential factor: Widows and widowers, divorcees, and people who are separated are more likely o send remit­ tances han married people. This is likely due o a strong feel­ ing of responsibility for relatives living abroad or being geo­ graphically separated from family members. These results are consisten with he research ha emphasizes he sig­ nificance of he family structure for remi ance behavior.26 Intention o return o home country influences remi ances The second model differentiates between migrants withou a refugee background and refugees. Additional factors, such as the intention o stay in Germany permanently and a strong bond o he home country, are investigated (Figure 6). I can be seen ha migrants who plan o live in Germany perma­ nently send remi ances abroad less often. This indicates tha a long-term intention o stay in Germany is associated with a greater prioritization of investments in Germany.27 In 22 Elke Holst, Andrea Schäfer, and Mechthild Schrooten, “Gender, Transnational Networks and Remi ances: Evidence from Germany,” DIW Discussion Paper no. 1005 (2010) (available online). 23 Rahel Kunz and Julia Maisenbacher, “Gender and remi ances,” in The Palgrave Handbook of Gender and Migration (2021), 321–338 (available online). 24 Docquier, Rapoport, and Salomone, “Remi ances, migrants' education and immigration ­policy.” 25 Richard H.

These findings contribute o a be er understanding of he complex motives and differen living conditions of migrants in Germany. 28 Tineke Fokkema, Eralba Cela, and Elena Ambrose i, “Giving from he hear or from he ego?

Moreover, remi ances sen via informal channels are often no included or are underestimated, which further dis­ torts he overall figures.8 For a clearer understanding of who is sending remi ances under wha conditions, we mus analyze he rends in remit­ tances and he driving factors behind hem more closely. Such an analysis provides no only a look a he economic relationships and realities of migrants in Germany, bu also reveals wha motives and challenges are driving hem o send financial suppor o heir home countries.

Infor­ mal channels are often faster and more affordable, bu carry risks such as money laundering and a lack of consumer protection. Official channels are regulated by financial institutions such as banks, money ransfer services (such as Western Union), or mobile financial services (such as M-Pesa). Cf.
