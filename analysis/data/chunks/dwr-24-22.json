When assessing proposed mergers, Competition Authorities should consider its impac on all relevan markets. Large mergers between manufacturers ypically impac competition, hus requiring he approval of Competition Authorities. Divestitures are often a condition of merger approval. This repor investi­ gates he effectiveness of implementing such merger reme­ dies when bargaining between manufacturers and retailers is a key marke feature. We examine he upstream",
    "merger between DEMB and Mondeléz ha was approved by he Euro­ pean Commission in May 2015, subjec o a divestiture. The divestiture indeed helped o mitigate he negative impacts of the merger. From he consumer’s poin of view, divestitures should ake place in favor of manufacturers with less bargain­ ing power. In concentrated markets, merger control is an importan tool for Competition Authorities. This is because i can preven further reductions in competition and because i is allowed o actively intervene in he market. This also applies o he food sector, where concentration along he supply chain has increased significantly in recen years. Retail has seen significan concentration, driven by waves of mergers,1 he formation of buying alliances,2 and the proliferation of private labels.3 Similarly, here has been an increase in concentration within he manufacturing sec­ tor.4 This concentration is driven in par by mergers and acquisitions ha have allowed manufacturers o increase their marke power. As a result, mos markets along he food supply chain end o be characterized by an oligopolis­ tic marke structure, in which a few firms with large marke shares operate a each level of he supply chain. Changes in competition and, herefore, marke power a one level of he supply chain are likely o affec all levels. For instance, in he case of an upstream merger, a reduction in the number of food manufacturers may lead o an increase in heir marke power, which could resul in higher whole­ sale prices paid by he retailers. The exten o which his increased upstream marke power is passed on o final con­ sumers depends on he bargaining power of he downstream firms. Therefore, in vertically related markets, Competition Authorities mus analyze he entire vertical marke struc­ ture in order o accurately assess he degree of competition along he value chain and he likely impac ha changes in competition may have on food-consumer prices. This is he case, for example, in he even of a merger and he imple­ mentation of remedies o address competition concerns. 1 Bha acharya Vivek, e al., “Merger effects and antitrus enforcement: Evidence from us retail,” NBER Working Paper 31123 (2023): 1–75 (available online). 2 Ma hew Grennan, “Price discrimination and bargaining: Empirical evidence from medical devices,” American Economic Review 103, no. 1 (2013): 145–177 (available online). 3 Claire Chambolle and Morgane Guignard, “Buyer Power and he Effec of Vertical Integration on Innovation,” DIW Berlin Discussion Paper no. 2071 (2024): 1–36 (available online). 4 Jan De Loecker, e al., “The rise of marke power and he macroeconomic implications,” The Quarterly Journal of Economics 135, no. 2 (2020): 561–644 (available online). 161 DIW Weekly Repor 22+23/2024 MERGER CONTROL AND BARGAINING POWER Figure Brand portfolio of he merger and he buyer before and after he merger with divestiture Source: Authors’ depiction. © DIW Berlin 2024 Carte Noire was divested and is now a par of Lavazza. Box 1 DEMB/Mondeléz join venture In May 2014, US company Mondeléz International Inc. (“Mondelez”) and Dutch company DE",
    "Master Blenders 1753 (“DEMB”) agreed to form a new entity called Jacobs Douwe Egberts (“JDE”).1 The join venture was expected o be he number one or number wo player in approximately 18 countries in Europe, Latin America, and Australia.2 In Germany, DEMB produces leading brands such as Senseo, and Mondeléz owns brands such as Jacobs. This is also he case in France, where both companies own well-known brands such as Grand’Mère for Mondeléz and L’Or for DEMB. The European Commission considered he relevan geographic mar­ kets as national and evaluated ha he merger impacts Austria, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, he Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, and he United Kingdom. However, he merger was only cleared subjec o divestitures in some countries where 1 Cf. he website of he European Commission merger case M. 7292 (available online). 2 Cf. he website of JDE (available online). A join venture is an entity formed by several com­ panies pooling skills and capital for a specific project. In his report, we use he erms merger and join venture interchangeably. competition issues were expected a he national level such as France and Denmark. For Germany, he European Commission expressed some concerns abou he filter pads market. However, following assessment, he European Commission concluded ha the ransaction was no expected o create a significan obstacle o effective competition. In France, however, he Commission found tha he merger would raise anti-competitive concern by eliminat­ ing competition between he brands L’Or and Carte Noire, which are viewed by consumers as close substitutes both owned by he parties, hus requiring a divestiture. The merged entity proposed to dives Carte Noire o Lavazza, including a production plan lo­ cated in he south of France. Lavazza centralized all its production lines a he facility. The acquisition enhanced Lavazza’s entry into the French marke hrough he acquisition of a local production plant. The Commission approved he divestiture in February 2016. The figure shows he brand portfolio of he merging parties and of Lavazza before and after he merger and he divestiture (Figure). 162 DIW Weekly Repor 22+23/2024 MERGER CONTROL AND BARGAINING POWER This repor analyses he impac of a landmark European merger case between DEMB and Mondelēz on prices and consumer welfare in he coffee marke (Box 1). Particular emphasis is placed on assessing he effectiveness of he imposed divestiture as a remedy o eliminate he anti-com­ petitive effects of he merger, when aking into accoun bar­ gaining power along he supply chain.5 Few Retailers and Coffee Manufacturers dominate he European Coffee Market In Europe, a few retailers and coffee manufacturers have sig­ nifican marke share in he consumer packaged goods mar­ ket. For instance, in Germany, major players – Aldi, Edeka, REWE, and he Schwarz-Group – dominate he retail market; in France, E.Leclerc, Carrefour, Les Mousquetaires (ITM), and Système U dominate. For example, in 2021, he com­ bined marke share of he op four companies in he retail industry was 54.6 percen in Germany and",
    "68.7 percen in France, indicating significan marke dominance by a few large players.6 Moreover, in France, he combined marke share of he hree larges coffee manufacturers was approx­ imately 58 percen in 2013.7 5 See Yann Delaprez und Morgane Guignard, “Upstream Mergers with Divestitures in Vertical Markets” (2022) (available online). 6 See Erin Maddren, The grocery retail marke in Germany (Europe Marke Research: 2022), 8 (available online); for France, see he Statista website (available online). CR4 corresponds o he highes four-firm concentration ratios often referred o as CR4. A value above 50 percen suggests significan marke control by hese firms, indicating high concentration and potentially reduced competition. 7 Authors’ calculation based on Kantar Worldpanel data. In such concentrated markets, wholesale prices are usually se hrough negotiations between manufacturers and retail­ ers. A suitable economic model for investigating hese nego­ tiations and he effects of mergers on he manufacturers is the Nash bargaining model (Box 2).8 Bargaining power plays a decisive role in he model: he greater a manufacturer's bar­ gaining power vis-à-vis a retailer, he higher he wholesale prices i can impose and he higher consumer prices will be. Conversely, if he bargaining power lies with he retailer, he wholesale and consumer prices will be relatively low. French retailers have a lo of bargaining power The firs step of our analysis is o estimate he bargain­ ing power of he manufacturers and retailers along he coffee value chain. Specifically, we examine purchases from he seven leading retailers: Carrefour, Leclerc, ITM, Auchan, Système U, Casino, and an aggregate of discount­ ers. Additionally, our focus extends o he brands produced by he eigh larges manufacturers: DEMB, Lavazza, Legal, Malongo, Mondelez, Nestlé, Segafredo, and an aggregate of private labels. This approach encompasses all manufactur­ ers mentioned by he Competition Authority and cited in the merger case. The data used for he analysis is Kantar Worldpanel on consumer coffee purchases in France from 2013 o 2017. I aims o implemen a retrospective analysis of he DEMB/Mondelēz merger case. The results indicate ha manufacturers face powerful retail­ ers in he French coffee marke (Figure 1). The merged entity has he weakes bargaining power vis-à-vis retailers compared to other manufacturers. The buyer of he divested brand also 8 Henrick Horn and Asher Wolinsky, “Bilateral monopolies and incentives for merger,” The RAND Journal of Economics 19, no. 3 (1988): 408–419 (available online). Box 2 Nash barganing model The model assumes ha bilateral contracts between manu­ facturers and retailers lead o gains from rade. These gains from rade are defined as he difference between he benefits of reaching an agreemen and hose ha would have been obtained if he agreemen failed. When an agreemen fails, a given manufacturer can sell its other products. The larger its portfolio of products, he less he manufacturer gains from an agreemen with a given retailer. Thus, a larger produc port­ folio leads o a be er bargaining position vis-à-vis retailers. Gains from rade are spli between he manufacturers and retailers. A manufacturer",
    "obtaining a higher share of he gains created from rade is said o have more bargaining power, which is represented by he so-called bargaining weights. Here we estimate he bargaining weigh of each side in simu­ lations, where his bargaining power is estimated, with values ranging from zero (no bargaining power) o one (full bargaining power).

Our estimates also allow for quantifying he cos savings associated with he merger and divestiture. The results sug­ ges ha he otal costs associated with he other products of he buyer of he divested brand, Lavazza, decreased after the divestiture. Indeed, he divestiture included Mondelez's manufacturing facility situated in he south of France, where Lavazza combined all its production lines for he Carte Noire brand. The acquisition of he French manufacturing facil­ ity enabled Lavazza o produce its own brand a he French facility, providing i easier access o he French marke and achieving more efficien production. Withou Divestiture, he Merger would have led to higher Consumer Prices To measure he impac of he merger and divestiture on final prices, i is necessary o determine wha prices would have been in he absence of he merger and divestiture. However, our datase only allows us o observe actual prices after he merger and divestiture occurred. The model can be used o simulate counterfactual prices o evaluate he changes in prices resulting from he merger and he divestiture, while considering he bargaining power within he vertical rela­ tionships existing in he French coffee market. This involves simulating wo scenarios: Scenario 1: The merger does no occur. Scenario 2: The merger occurs withou divestiture. The comparison between he simulated prices of Scenario 1 and he observed prices measures he price effec of he merger and he divestiture. The comparison between he simulated prices of Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 measures he price effec of he merger withou divestiture. Furthermore, the model enables us o estimate changes in consumer sur­ plus in response o counterfactual prices. Figure 2 shows he percentage changes in prices resulting from he merger with and withou he divestiture. The results indicate hat, in he absence of divestiture, he merger would have led o price increases of around 5 percent, which corre­ sponds o an increase of around 1.14 euros per kilogram. The price changes resulting from he merger with he divestiture imposed by he European Commission are lower, resulting instead in a price increase of approximately wo percent, or an increase of approximately 0.46 euros per kilogram. In addi­ tion, he divestiture",
    "resulted in some cos efficiencies for he buyer, which led o a price decrease of approximately 1.72 per­ cent, or approximately 0.22 euros per kilogram (Figure 2). 9 Due o confidentiality restrictions, specific manufacturer names canno be directly associated with prices or marke shares. Columns (i) and (ii) of he Table show he variation in con­ sumer surplus with and withou he divestiture.10 Had he European Commission approved he merger withou rem­ edies, he reduction in consumer surplus would have been more pronounced han with remedies, decreasing consumer surplus by abou 483,000 euros for sampled consumers. The merger cleared with divestiture led o an overall reduc­ tion in consumer surplus of abou 132,000 euros for sam­ pled consumers. The results indicate ha although he merger reduced con­ sumer surplus, his reduction is mitigated by he divesti­ ture. This supports he European Commission's decision to require divestiture o mitigate he anticompetitive effects of he merger. Yet, he divestiture failed both o fully pre­ ven negative consumer effects and o restore competition. Considering Bargaining Power in Vertically related Markets is importan when requiring divestiture We now examine he importance of quantifying bargaining power when evaluating potential buyers of divested brands in order o effectively assess he impac of divestiture on con­ sumer prices. We provide recommendations o Competition Authorities on how o selec he buyer of he divested brand in vertical markets. 10 Discrete choice models are used o calculate he change in consumer surplus; Kenneth Train, “Discrete Choice Methods with Simulation,” Second Edition. (2009): Cambridge University Press. Figure 2 Predicted price effects of he merger and he divestiture Change in prices in percent Source: Authors’ calculations. © DIW Berlin 2024 Withou he divestiture, he observed price increase for he merged entity’s brands would be higher. 164 DIW Weekly Repor 22+23/2024 MERGER CONTROL AND BARGAINING POWER Another importan factor causing a change in competition a one level of he food supply chain is mergers between compa­ nies. Mergers mus be approved by Competition Authorities. A condition of merger approval is often he implementation of a divestiture. In his report, we discuss he effectiveness of divestiture as a merger remedy. We argue ha i may be less effective in vertically related industries where bargaining is a key feature of he market. If Competition Authorities ignore he inher­ en imbalance in bargaining power between manufacturers and retailers when enforcing upstream divestiture, hey are likely o implemen a policy ha does no restore competi­ tion in he market. The main reason is ha here is no a direc relationship between marke share and bargaining power. The bargain­ ing literature identifies several potential determinants of bargaining power. For example, higher bargaining power may resul from superior brand assortment, firms' willing­ ness o bargain patiently, or enhanced bargaining skills. Antitrus authorities canno infer hese bargaining power values from observed marke shares alone, as we show ha a small buyer can have large bargaining power and reduce con­ sumer surplus more han a large buyer with smaller bargain­",
    "ing power. Therefore, an accurate estimation of hese bar­ gaining weights is crucial for decisions regarding he selec­ tion of he buyer for he divested brand. This has importan implications for competition policy in Europe, bu also spe­ cifically in Germany. Germany recently introduced a new amendmen o the German Competition Act, known as he 11th GWB Amendment, ha could increase he number of divesti­ tures in certain markets. Indeed, an importan aspec of this amendmen is he introduction of a new marke inves­ tigation ool ha allows for policy intervention in markets where here are significan and lasting distortion of com­ petition withou a proven breach of competition law.11 This repor argues ha bargaining power is a key factor ha mus be aken into consideration. 11 For more details, see Tabea Bauermeister, “New Provisions in German Competition Law: New Competition Tool, Provisions Accompanying he DMA and a Presumption of Benefits,” Kluwer Competition Law Blog, 2023. (available online). Precisely, we study an alternative scenario in which he divested brand is ransferred o a differen manufacturer. This hypothetical scenario is interesting because he alterna­ tive manufacturer has a smaller marke share (1.57 percen on average compared o 1.83 percen for he actual buyer) bu higher bargaining power han he actual buyer (0.41 for he rival manufacturer compared o 0.27 for he actual buyer). Because of he smaller marke share i would be a more acceptable alternative for approval by he Competition Authorities, compared o he actual buyer, when ignoring the bargaining power. By contrast, we find ha divesting o a small buyer – in erms of marke shares – migh no be he bes policy in vertically related industries. Indeed, our results sugges ha divesting a brand o a small buyer with significan bargaining power is unlikely o mitigate he anti-competitive effects of he merger. If he divested brand is bough by he alternative buyer (col­ umn (iii)), he negative impac on consumer surplus becomes more pronounced with an overall decrease in consumer sur­ plus of abou 149,000 euros for sampled consumers. More broadly, he results indicate ha he actual divestiture leads o he smalles change in consumer surplus. Conclusion: Bargaining Power mus be understood when evaluating mergers The food supply chain is a key driver of he European econ­ omy. The degree of competition a each level of he supply chain determines he exten o which a change in compe­ tition a one level of he supply chain will affec all levels.
