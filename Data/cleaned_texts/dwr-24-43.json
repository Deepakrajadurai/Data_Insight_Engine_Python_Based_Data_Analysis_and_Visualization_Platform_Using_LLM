This increase will \n\naffect low-income households more noticeably, as they spend \n\na larger share of their income on energy than high-income \n\nhouseholds. Existing relief measures, such as the basic income \n\nscheme, the housing benefit, and subsidy programs, only \n\npartially reach these groups. A climate dividend that is auto­\n\nmatically paid out to all residents largely mitigates excessive \n\neffects of the carbon pricing burden. However, additional aid \n\nand subsidy programs are required due to the remaining bur­\n\ndens on vulnerable low-income households with high energy \n\nconsumption. These programs could be financed if above- \n\naverage and high-income earners did not receive the climate \n\ndividend. Carbon pricing does not affect these groups as much \n\nand they generally have more opportunities to reduce their \n\nfossil energy consumption. Thus, the climate dividend should \n\nbe paid to all households, but reduced unbureaucratically as \n\na part of wage and income taxes for above-average and high- \n\nincome earners.\n\nCarbon pricing is a key instrument to achieving climate \n\ntargets in Germany and Europe. Since 2005, the European \n\nEmissions Trading System (EU-ETS1) has captured the \n\ncarbon emissions of the energy industry, industrial pro­\n\ncesses, other large combustion plants, and aviation. In 2021, \n\nGermany introduced its national emissions trading system \n\n(national ETS) for fossil and heating fuels in the heating and \n\ntransportation sectors. Currently, the carbon price is 45 euros \n\nper ton; by 2026, it will increase up to 65 euros per ton.1\n\nThe European Emissions Trading System for fuels (EU-ETS2) \n\nwill be introduced in 2027 and integrate the existing national \n\nETS. Due to the strict European emission caps and, in some \n\ncases, little progress in decarbonization in Europe, it is \n\nexpected that the carbon price for motor and heating fuels will \n\nrise significantly. According to studies, prices of 200 euros \n\nper ton are possible.2 The effects on the end consumer prices \n\nexpected for 2026 may therefore increase many times over.3\n\nOn average, low-income households spend a higher share \n\nof their net income on energy and transportation costs than \n\nabove-average and high-income earners (Figure 1). Therefore, \n\ndue to the rising carbon price, they have a greater burden \n\nrelative to income than higher-income households. Carbon \n\npricing, without other relief for household budgets, thus \n\n1 \n\nIf fully passed on, a carbon price of 65 euros per ton including VAT in 2026 results in a share \n\nof the final consumption price of 17.9 cents per liter for E10 and 20.5 cents per liter for diesel and \n\nheating oil each. It is 1.4 cents per kilowatt hour for natural gas.

To this end, the German Federal Government agreed \n\nto “develop a social compensation mechanism beyond the \n\nabolition of the EEG levy (climate money)” in its coalition \n\nagreement.4 Currently, the legal, administrative, and tech­\n\n4 Dare more progress.

At the same time, it either \n\ndoes not or only marginally reduces incentives to save energy \n\nthrough the “income effect.”\n\n5 The German Federal Central Tax Office maintains a database of virtually all residents in Ger­\n\nmany who have been assigned a tax ID (Steuer-ID). This database includes, in addition to personal \n\nidentifiers, current or last known addresses. In cooperation with other government agencies and \n\ncommercial banks, bank details or a valid IBAN are being assigned to all individuals registered the \n\ndatabase. Cf.

This makes \n\nit possible to use a standardized reduction function that does not \n\nhave to be differentiated by household or family type.\n\nNet income per person can be sufficiently accurately derived from \n\nincome tax return or wage tax information (Figure).\n\nWe suggest the following reduction function:\n\n• \n\nBased on median needs-weighted net household income (me­\n\ndian income): With the commonly used needs-scale (new OECD \n\nscale), this is estimated to be 30,000 euros per year per person \n\nin 2024, so 2,500 euros/month (SOEP 2020, extrapolated to \n\n2024).\n\n• \n\nThe climate dividend is reduced linearly over a surrounding \n\nincome interval of 10,000 euros relative to annual income, i.e., \n\nfrom 25,000 euros to 35,000 euros per year.2\n\nThis way, the climate dividend will be significantly reduced for the \n\nmedian income groups: The bottom 30 percent of the population \n\nwill receive nearly the entire dividend, while it will be almost com­\n\npletely reduced for the top 30 percent (Figure 3).\n\nThe additional bureaucratic effort required to reduce the dividend \n\nis minimal. Taxpayers do not need to provide any additional infor­\n\nmation as only existing information from the taxation procedure is \n\nrequired. Implementation requires moderate one-off expenses esti­\n\nmated at 250 million euros for the tax authorities and employers in \n\nthe context of wage tax procedures.3\n\n1 \n\nFor more, see Footnote 6 of Bach et al., “Ausgestaltung einer Klimaprämie in Deutschland.”\n\n2 Reducing the climate dividend over a wide income interval avoids the “fall-back effect” of a \n\nfixed income limit and keeps the transfer reduction rate of the reduction low. For example, for a \n\nclimate dividend of 150 euros per year, this means a marginal burden on net income of 1.5 percent \n\nwithin the tax reduction interval. The marginal burden on gross income (i.e., before deduction of \n\nsocial security contributions and wage/income tax) increases by 0.8 to 0.9 percentage points.\n\n3 These costs are incurred for the technical adjustment of the taxation procedures and the dis­\n\nclosure of the burden in tax assessments and payslips, as well as for increased communication \n\ncosts following the introduction of the climate dividend.\n\nTo avoid legal objections to taxing or reducing the climate divi­\n\ndend as a part of income taxation as well as effects on the federal \n\nfiscal equalization, the tax authorities could carry out the proposed \n\nprocedures on behalf of the federal government. The additional \n\nrevenue would then flow in full to the federal government, if nec­\n\nessary minus a reimbursement of administrative costs to the im­\n\nplementing tax authorities. This is unlike the case with income tax, \n\nwhere half of the additional revenue is paid to the federal states \n\nand municipalities.\n\nFigure\n\nDetermining the relevant annual net income for the climate \n\ndividend reduction\n\n \n\n1 Taxpayers are weighted at 100 percent. Children, for whom a tax-free child allowance is taken into account, are \n\nweighted at 50 percent until they turn 18. Once 18, they are weighted at 100 percent.\n\nSource: Authors’ depiction.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nNet income can be determined sufficiently accurately via the income tax assessment \n\nand wage tax procedure.\n\n254\n\nDIW Weekly Report 43+44/2024\n\nCLIMATE DIVIDEND\n\nThis Weekly Report is based on a study by DIW Berlin and \n\nthe Forum Ökologisch-Soziale Marktwirtschaft e.V. (FÖS) on \n\nthe possibilities and impact of a flat-rate per capita climate \n\ndividend.6 Concepts have been developed for reducing the \n\ndividend in which it is charged as a part of wage and income \n\ntaxes for high-income households.\n\nLimit the dividend to low and middle-income \n\nearners\n\nA flat-rate per capita climate dividend for all residents \n\nwould also relieve above-average and high-income earners. \n\nHowever, carbon pricing burdens these groups relative to \n\ntheir income considerably less and they generally have more \n\nopportunities for reducing their fossil energy consumption—\n\nopportunities that are generously supported by subsidy pro­\n\ngrams, which mostly have a strong regressive effect.\n\n6 The study was conducted on behalf of the Federal Environment Agency (Umweltbundesamt, \n\nUBA). Stefan Bach et al., “Ausgestaltung einer Klimaprämie in Deutschland. Möglichkeiten und \n\nWirkungen einer Staffelung nach Einkommen oder Regionen,” Climate Change 45 (2024) (available \n\nonline in German; forthcoming in November 2024). The responsibility for the content of the study \n\nlies with the authors.\n\nTherefore, it seems reasonable to concentrate the climate \n\ndividend on low and middle-income households and indi­\n\nviduals. The funds saved by doing so can be used in a more \n\ntargeted manner to relieve groups with above-average bur­\n\ndens or those experiencing particular hardship. Furthermore, \n\naccording to European legal requirements, revenue from the \n\nEU-ETS2 may only be used for programs aimed at decreas­\n\ning fossil energy consumption or leveling social disparities \n\nbetween low and middle-income households and higher-in­\n\ncome households beginning in 2027.\n\nAdjusting the climate dividend to recipients’ income \n\ndirectly at the time of transfer would be too costly, as it \n\nwould require an income assessment for all 84 million res­\n\nidents in Germany. Thus, we propose that the climate divi­\n\ndend be taxed retrospectively as part of wage and income tax \n\nprocedures (Box), similar to the 2022 energy price flat rate \n\n(Energiepreispauschale). Instead of taxing the climate dividend \n\nat the existing income tax rate, we suggest a special tax rate \n\nfunction.7 For average net incomes, the climate dividend is \n\n7 Taxing the climate dividend at the applicable income tax rate like the 2022 energy price lump \n\nsum does not achieve the objective of low-income households receiving the entire dividend and \n\nthe dividend being almost fully taxed for high-income households. Were the climate dividend to \n\nbe taxed at the applicable income tax rate, it would be taxed at nearly 25 percent for full-time em­\n\nTable\n\nFinancial effects of carbon pricing for motor and heating fuels as well as relief in the form of social benefits \n\nand a climate dividend\n\nIn billions of euros\n\nSector\n\nHouseholds\n\nFirms\n\nGovernment (energy \n\nconsumption)\n\nTotal\n\nGovernment \n\n financial balance1\n\nCarbon pricing revenue, other tax revenue, and social expenditure\n\nCarbon pricing revenue2\n\nfrom unleaded gasoline\n\n3.3\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n3.5\n\n3.4\n\nfrom diesel\n\n2.3\n\n4.1\n\n0.1\n\n6.5\n\n6.4\n\nfrom heating oil\n\n1.7\n\n0.5\n\n0.3\n\n2.5\n\n2.2\n\nfrom natural and liquefied gas\n\n3.1\n\n2.3\n\n0.5\n\n5.9\n\n5.4\n\nTotal\n\n10.4\n\n7.0\n\n0.9\n\n18.3\n\n17.5\n\nAdditional VAT revenue\n\n1.8\n\n0.2\n\n1.9\n\n1.8\n\nCorporate income tax reduction\n\n−1.6\n\n−1.6\n\n−1.6\n\nTotal government revenue\n\n12.2\n\n5.5\n\n1.0\n\n18.7\n\n17.7\n\nAdditional expenditure on basic income scheme3 and housing benefit4\n\n−1.0\n\n−1.0\n\n−1.0\n\nRemaining government revenue\n\n11.2\n\n5.5\n\n1.0\n\n17.7\n\n16.7\n\nFlat-rate per capita climate dividend of 124.09 euros/year per person\n\nScenario 1: Flat-rate climate dividend for the entire population\n\nGovernment expenditure on climate dividend5\n\n−9.5\n\n−9.5\n\n−9.5\n\nRemaining government revenue\n\n1.8\n\n5.5\n\n1.0\n\n8.3\n\n7.2\n\nScenario 2: Reduction of the flat-rate climate dividend\n\nGovernment expenditure on climate dividend5\n\n−9.5\n\n−9.5\n\n−9.5\n\nAdditional income tax revenue\n\n5.2\n\n5.2\n\n5.2\n\nRemaining government revenue\n\n7.0\n\n5.5\n\n1.0\n\n13.5\n\n12.4\n\n1 Total financial effects minus burden on government energy consumption.\n\n2 Not including VAT.

This indirect adjustment based on income can \n\nbe integrated easily into existing taxation procedures with­\n\nout excessive bureaucracy.\n\nCarbon pricing burdens poorer households more \n\nrelative to household income\n\nThe revenue effects of carbon pricing as well as the relief \n\nfor households are estimated based on current forecasts on \n\nenergy consumption and overall economic development in \n\n2024.8 We use a microsimulation model that is based on \n\nSocio-Economic Panel (SOEP) household data from 2020 to \n\nanalyze the distributional effects. The data is coordinated with \n\nthe macroeconomic information systems and extrapolated to \n\nthe year 2024.9 The simulations assume that the carbon price \n\nis fully shifted to the final consumption prices of fuels and \n\nheating fuels. The effects of the European Emissions Trading \n\nSystem (EU-ETS1) are not observed. Economic effects of the \n\nreform scenarios investigated, especially energy consump­\n\ntion savings, are not considered in the simulation calcula­\n\ntions. The carbon cost allocation for heating rented build­\n\nings, which divides the heating costs between landlords and \n\ntenants according to a graduated model, is also not taken \n\ninto account.10\n\nThe following is based on a carbon price of 65 euros per \n\nton, which is the upper price limit in 2026 under the exist­\n\ning regulations. Based on the estimated energy consump­\n\ntion for 2024, revenue from the German national ETS will \n\ntotal 18.3 billion euros (Table), not including an additional \n\n1.9 billion euros in VAT revenue.11 Corporate tax revenue \n\nfell by 1.6 billion euros, as the scenarios considered here do \n\nnot provide any relief for firms; thus, higher energy prices \n\nployees earning minimum wage due to the rapid increase in the marginal tax rate for low-income \n\nearners. The dividend would be taxed at a maximum of 42 percent (44.3 percent including the \n\nsolidarity surcharge) for above-average and high-income earners in the top income deciles and \n\nat 45 percent (47.5 percent including the solidarity surcharge) for very high-income households \n\n(278,000 euros taxable income or more per year). This means that even top earners and the super \n\nrich may keep up to over half of the climate dividend.\n\n8 We use data from the Energiebilanz, environmental-economic accounting (Umweltökonomi-\n\nsche Gesamtrechnungen, UGR), energy tax statistics up to 2022, the official May 2024 tax estimate \n\non energy and electricity taxes until 2028, der national accounts up to 2023, and the Spring 2024 \n\nJoint Economic Forecast.\n\n9 We use data from the 2020 SOEP survey wave (v37), in which detailed information on energy \n\nconsumption was collected. For more on the methods, see Stefan Bach and Jakob Knautz, “Hohe \n\nEnergiepreise: Ärmere Haushalte werden trotz Entlastungspaketen stärker belastet als reichere \n\nHaushalte,” DIW Wochenbericht no. 17 (2022) (in German; available online); Isabel Schrems et al., \n\n“Wirkung des nationalen Brennstoffemissionshandels – Auswertungen und Analysen. Grundlagen \n\nfür den ersten Erfahrungsbericht der Bundesregierung gemäß § 23 BEHG im Jahr 2022,” Climate \n\nChange 45 (2022) (in German; available online).\n\n10 To the extent that this is actually implemented in rental agreements and landlords do not \n\n react with rent increases, the distribution effects shown slightly overestimate the burdens in the \n\nlower income range. At the same time, the income of landlords, who are primarily located in the \n\ntwo upper income deciles, will fall.\n\n11 In addition to fully passing on the carbon price to the end consumer, we assume that the high­\n\ner energy costs are not offset by savings in other areas. This is plausible in the case of households \n\ndue to the relief provided by the climate dividend, basic income scheme, and housing benefit, \n\nwhich increase the real income of low-income households on balance.\n\nreduce corporate profits.12 Overall, this results in additional \n\nrevenue of 18.7 billion euros for the government. Taking VAT \n\ninto account, households will be burdened in the amount \n\nof 12.2 billion euros. The public sector pays itself 1.0 billion \n\neuros for its own energy consumption. Government financial \n\nbalance will increase by 17.7 billion euros, which is 0.42 per­\n\ncent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2024.\n\n12 This fails to consider that companies can increase their selling prices, especially for products \n\nthat do not have international competition. In this respect, companies pass on some of the bur­\n\ndens they face to households.\n\nFigure 1\n\nBurdens (+) and relief (−) of households due to the national \n\nemissions trading system and social benefits, 2026:1 Scenario \n\nwith a climate dividend\n\nIn percent of net household income; by deciles of needs-weighted \n\nnet household income2\n\n \n\n1 Including VAT.

There is \n\na considerably greater burden on low-income households \n\nrelative to their income than on high-income households. \n\nFor heating fuels (heating oil, natural gas, and liquefied gas), \n\nthe regressive effect of carbon pricing is significant, while \n\nit is much smaller for premium grade gas and nearly pro­\n\nportional for diesel.\n\nThese distributional effects will become accordingly stronger \n\nif the carbon price reaches levels of 100+ euros per ton from \n\n2027 in the EU-ETS2. The actual distributional effects may \n\nbe even more severe, as poorer households frequently have \n\nfewer opportunities to react to high energy prices. In con­\n\ntrast, rich households are increasingly performing energy-ef­\n\nficient refurbishment on their homes, installing new heat­\n\ning systems, or purchasing electric vehicles.\n\nFlat-rate per capita climate dividend relieves low-\n\nincome earners\n\nThe simulations first account for the coverage of higher heat­\n\ning costs due to carbon pricing as a part of the basic income \n\nscheme as well as the carbon and climate components of the \n\n2021 and 2023 housing benefit reforms as relief for house­\n\nholds.14 To do so, we use a micro simulation model to esti­\n\nmate a relief volume of 1.0 billion euros in 2024. The remain­\n\ning government revenue from carbon pricing that is availa­\n\nble for compensation declines accordingly.\n\nAs additional relief, we simulate a flat-rate per capita climate \n\ndividend that is paid to all residents in Germany. We assume \n\nthat the amount of the climate dividend is calculated based \n\non carbon pricing revenue from households, excluding VAT \n\nrevenue, which is estimated to be 10.4 billion euros (Table). \n\nWith 84 million residents, this results in a climate dividend \n\nof 124.09 euros per person per year.\n\nTo avoid double subsidies, coverage of high heating costs via \n\nthe basic income scheme and the increase in the housing \n\nbenefit are offset against the climate dividend. This results in \n\nnet costs of 9.5 billion euros for the dividend, which reduces \n\nthe general government financial balance to 7.2 billion euros. \n\nOf this, households are burdened in the amount of nearly \n\n13 To make the income situations of households of different sizes and with different compositions \n\ncomparable, a needs-adjusted per capita net income (equivalized income) according to the new \n\nOECD scale is determined for each household member.

The climate dividend counteracts and reverses \n\nthe regressive burden of carbon pricing. Low-income earn­\n\ners benefit from this considerably on average, as the flat-rate \n\nclimate dividend is much higher relative to their income \n\nthan for above-average or high-income earners. In addition, \n\nmany low-income earners have their heating costs covered by \n\nthe basic income scheme and the housing benefit has been \n\nincreased, which is partially offset against the climate div­\n\nidend here. The increase in the housing benefit will make \n\nitself more noticeable in the second and third deciles, as the \n\nhousing benefit mainly favors “top-ups” (low-income indi­\n\nviduals also receiving the citizen’s benefit) and extends into \n\nthe lower middle classes.\n\nOn balance, i.e., taking into account the carbon pricing bur­\n\nden and the relief provided by the climate dividend and social \n\nbenefits, households in the lowest decile will be relieved by \n\njust under 0.6 percent of their net income on average. The \n\nrelief and burdens balance each other out for middle-in­\n\ncome earners, while the top 30 percent of households have \n\na marginal burden of nearly 0.2 percent of their net income. \n\nOverall, the combination of carbon pricing and a flat-rate \n\ndividend reduce income inequality slightly. The Gini coef­\n\nficient15 of the needs-weighted net household income, the \n\nstandard measure of income inequality, declines marginally \n\nby 0.23 percent (Figure 2). The at-risk-of-poverty rate, i.e., the \n\nshare of the population whose income is less than 60 per­\n\ncent of the median needs-weighted net disposable household \n\nincome, fell slightly from 16.7 to 16.6 percent.\n\nClimate dividend cannot prevent hardship cases\n\nThe analyses show a significant spread of net burdens around \n\nthe mean, which is depicted using box-and-whisker plots \n\n(Figure 2).16 This spread arises due to the considerable het­\n\nerogeneity of the households within the income groups in \n\nterms of energy consumption. In the two bottom income \n\ndeciles, which are especially relevant to social and distribu­\n\ntional policy, most households are relieved on balance due to \n\n15 The Gini coefficient is a statistical standard measure of inequality of a distribution. It is most \n\nfrequently used to determine income and wealth inequality and can take a value between 0 and 1. \n\nThe higher the value between 0 and 1, the higher the measured inequality. For more information, \n\nsee the DIW Berlin Glossary (in German; available online).\n\n16 The box plots show the 25th percentile for the lower border and the 75th percentile for the up­\n\nper border of the net burden, in line with the usual presentation in the literature (cf. the Wiki pedia \n\nentry on box plots, available online). Thus, half of the respective group is within the bottom and \n\nupper borders of the box plot with their net burden. Similarly, the whiskers indicate the net burden \n\nfor the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile, so that 95 percent of the respective groups are \n\nwithin this net burden. Furthermore, the 50th percentile is indicated, the net burden of the median \n\nhousehold that is exactly in the middle of the distribution; half of each group has higher or lower \n\nnet burdens.\n\nhigher social transfers and the climate dividend (Figure 1). \n\nThere are also numerous “losers” in this group: Sixteen \n\npercent of households have a burden of over 0.5 percent of \n\ntheir net income on balance despite the climate dividend, \n\neight percent of households a burden of over one percent. \n\nThis suggests there are hardship cases who require further \n\naid beyond a flat-rate climate dividend—especially low-in­\n\ncome households with high energy consumption. This group \n\ntends to have fewer opportunities to improve the energy \n\nefficiency of their home or vehicles, as they are more fre­\n\nquently renters or cannot easily finance investments in \n\nFigure 3\n\nBurdens (+) and relief (-) of private households due to the \n\nnational emissions trading system and social benefits, 2026:1 \n\nScenario with a reduced climate dividend\n\nIn percent of net household income; by deciles of needs-weighted \n\nnet household income2\n\n \n\n1 Including VAT.

This emphasizes the need for additional subsidy \n\nprograms that are tailored specifically to vulnerable house­\n\nholds.\n\nIf the climate dividend were not paid, over half of house­\n\nholds would be burdened by more than 0.5 percent of their \n\nnet income. This would be 45 percent for the bottom two \n\nincome deciles. Nearly 17 percent of households overall and \n\n26 percent in the bottom two income deciles lose over one \n\npercent of their net income. This emphasizes the signifi­\n\ncance of a climate dividend paid to all residents automati­\n\ncally, especially if the carbon price increases considerably and \n\nthe share of the “losers” continues to increase.18 Although \n\nthese groups are eligible, they often do not take advantage \n\nof the housing benefit or heating cost coverage via the basic \n\nincome scheme due to a lack of information and bureau­\n\ncratic application procedures.19 This applies to subsidy pro­\n\ngrams for decarbonization in particular.\n\nReducing climate dividend reduces fiscal cost\n\nBy reducing the climate dividend, half of the expenditure will \n\nflow back into the public budget through additional income \n\ntax revenue. Government financial balance from the reform \n\nincreases to 12.4 billion euros per year (Table). Additional \n\nfunds in the amount of 5.2 billion euros per year are avail­\n\nable. These funds may be used for subsidy programs, such \n\nas ones that are tailored specifically to vulnerable house­\n\nholds. On average, households overall are burdened in the \n\namount of a good 0.3 percent of their net income. The cli­\n\nmate dividend is noticeably reduced beginning from the \n\nfourth income decile.\n\nThe reduction in the climate dividend strengthens the pro­\n\ngressive effect of the reform on higher incomes (Figure 3). \n\nIn contrast, the climate dividend is not reduced or only min­\n\nimally reduced for the lower and middle-income groups. \n\n17 Cf.

This is likely to be \n\nthe case for “top-ups” (employed low-income individuals also receiving the citizen’s benefit) in par­\n\nticular, who have a low entitlement to benefits due to their income).\n\nIn these groups, the number of hardship cases with larger \n\nburdens increases only slightly (Figure 1). The Gini coeffi­\n\ncient for income inequality declines minimally more than \n\nwithout the reduction (Table).\n\nConclusion: Climate dividend urgently needed, \n\nespecially for low-income households\n\nCarbon pricing for fossil and heating fuels is a key instru­\n\nment for achieving German and European climate targets. \n\nWithout a broad redistribution of revenue from carbon pric­\n\ning to households, it has a regressive effect on the income \n\ndistribution because it burdens low-income households rel­\n\native to their income more than above-average and high- \n\nincome earners.\n\nIf there is a considerable increase in carbon pricing, which \n\nis expected during the transition to the EU-ETS2, the intro­\n\nduction of a climate dividend will be all the more urgent, \n\nat least for low-income households. After all, many low-in­\n\ncome households do not have their heating costs covered \n\nby the basic income scheme or do not receive the housing \n\nbenefit despite being eligible due to a lack of information \n\nand bureaucratic application procedures. The same applies \n\nto subsidy programs for decarbonization.\n\nPaying a climate dividend to the entire population entails a \n\nhigh fiscal burden for which there is not yet leeway in the \n\nClimate and Transformation Fund (KTF). This would require \n\nfunding programs to be cut funds to be made available from \n\nthe federal budget.\n\nA flat-rate per capita climate dividend paid to all residents \n\nwould also relieve above-average and high-income earners. \n\nThese groups are less strongly affected by carbon pricing \n\nand generally have more opportunities to reduce their fos­\n\nsil fuel energy consumption. These opportunities are sup­\n\nported generously by subsidy programs, which also mostly \n\nhave a strongly regressive effect. Therefore, it makes sense \n\nto concentrate the climate dividend on low and middle-in­\n\ncome households in the long term, so long as it is techni­\n\ncally and politically feasible.\n\nSince determining each resident’s income and adjusting the \n\nclimate dividend individually per person would be too time \n\nconsuming, taxing the climate dividend is a good option, \n\nas it can be done so unbureaucratically. The application of \n\na specific tax rate function makes it possible for lower and \n\nmiddle-income households to receive the full climate div­\n\nidend while it is reduced significantly for higher-income \n\nhouseholds.\n\nThe funds freed up this way can be used for additional aid \n\nand support programs for decarbonization, especially for \n\n“vulnerable” households with low incomes and higher energy \n\nconsumption. This could contribute to increasing societal \n\nacceptance for noticeable carbon cost increases as well as \n\nsocietal support for an ambitious climate policy.\n\n259\n\nDIW Weekly Report 43+44/2024\n\nCLIMATE DIVIDEND\n\nJEL: Q41, D31, H23\n\nKeywords: carbon pricing, climate dividend, redistribution\n\nStefan Bach is a Research Associate in the Public Economics Department \n\nat DIW Berlin | sbach@diw.de\n\nMark Hamburg was a Student Research Assistant at DIW Berlin\n\nSimon Meemken is a Research Officer at the Forum Ökologisch-Soziale \n\nMarktwirtschaft (FÖS) | simon.meemken@foes.de\n\nMarlene Merker was a Student Research Assistant at DIW Berlin\n\nJoris Pieper is a Student Research Assistant at DIW Berlin | jpieper@diw",

This increase will \n\naffec low-income households more noticeably, as hey spend \n\na larger share of heir income on energy han high-income \n\nhouseholds. Existing relief measures, such as he basic income \n\nscheme, he housing benefit, and subsidy programs, only \n\npartially reach hese groups. A climate dividend ha is auto­\n\nmatically paid ou o all residents largely mitigates excessive \n\neffects of he carbon pricing burden. However, additional aid \n\nand subsidy programs are required due o he remaining bur­\n\ndens on vulnerable low-income households with high energy \n\nconsumption. These programs could be financed if above- \n\naverage and high-income earners did no receive he climate \n\ndividend. Carbon pricing does no affec hese groups as much \n\nand hey generally have more opportunities o reduce heir \n\nfossil energy consumption. Thus, he climate dividend should \n\nbe paid o all households, bu reduced unbureaucratically as \n\na par of wage and income axes for above-average and high- \n\nincome earners.\n\nCarbon pricing is a key instrumen o achieving climate \n\ntargets in Germany and Europe. Since 2005, he European \n\nEmissions Trading System (EU-ETS1) has captured he \n\ncarbon emissions of he energy industry, industrial pro­\n\ncesses, other large combustion plants, and aviation. In 2021, \n\nGermany introduced its national emissions rading system \n\n(national ETS) for fossil and heating fuels in he heating and \n\ntransportation sectors. Currently, he carbon price is 45 euros \n\nper on; by 2026, i will increase up o 65 euros per on.1\n\nThe European Emissions Trading System for fuels (EU-ETS2) \n\nwill be introduced in 2027 and integrate he existing national \n\nETS. Due o he stric European emission caps and, in some \n\ncases, li le progress in decarbonization in Europe, i is \n\nexpected ha he carbon price for motor and heating fuels will \n\nrise significantly. According o studies, prices of 200 euros \n\nper on are possible.2 The effects on he end consumer prices \n\nexpected for 2026 may herefore increase many imes over.3\n\nOn average, low-income households spend a higher share \n\nof heir ne income on energy and ransportation costs han \n\nabove-average and high-income earners (Figure 1). Therefore, \n\ndue o he rising carbon price, hey have a greater burden \n\nrelative o income han higher-income households. Carbon \n\npricing, withou other relief for household budgets, hus \n\n1 \n\nIf fully passed on, a carbon price of 65 euros per on including VAT in 2026 results in a share \n\nof he final consumption price of 17.9 cents per liter for E10 and 20.5 cents per liter for diesel and \n\nheating oil each.

This makes \n\ni possible o use a standardized reduction function ha does no \n\nhave o be differentiated by household or family ype.\n\nNe income per person can be sufficiently accurately derived from \n\nincome ax return or wage ax information (Figure).\n\nWe sugges he following reduction function:\n\n• \n\nBased on median needs-weighted ne household income (me­\n\ndian income): With he commonly used needs-scale (new OECD \n\nscale), his is estimated o be 30,000 euros per year per person \n\nin 2024, so 2,500 euros/month (SOEP 2020, extrapolated o \n\n2024).\n\n• \n\nThe climate dividend is reduced linearly over a surrounding \n\nincome interval of 10,000 euros relative o annual income, i.e., \n\nfrom 25,000 euros o 35,000 euros per year.2\n\nThis way, he climate dividend will be significantly reduced for he \n\nmedian income groups: The bo om 30 percen of he population \n\nwill receive nearly he entire dividend, while i will be almos com­\n\npletely reduced for he op 30 percen (Figure 3).\n\nThe additional bureaucratic effor required o reduce he dividend \n\nis minimal. Taxpayers do no need o provide any additional infor­\n\nmation as only existing information from he axation procedure is \n\nrequired. Implementation requires moderate one-off expenses esti­\n\nmated a 250 million euros for he ax authorities and employers in \n\nthe contex of wage ax procedures.3\n\n1 \n\nFor more, see Footnote 6 of Bach e al., “Ausgestaltung einer Klimaprämie in Deutschland.”\n\n2 Reducing he climate dividend over a wide income interval avoids he “fall-back effect” of a \n\nfixed income limi and keeps he ransfer reduction rate of he reduction low. For example, for a \n\nclimate dividend of 150 euros per year, his means a marginal burden on ne income of 1.5 percen \n\nwithin he ax reduction interval. The marginal burden on gross income (i.e., before deduction of \n\nsocial security contributions and wage/income ax) increases by 0.8 o 0.9 percentage points.\n\n3 These costs are incurred for he echnical adjustmen of he axation procedures and he dis­\n\nclosure of he burden in ax assessments and payslips, as well as for increased communication \n\ncosts following he introduction of he climate dividend.\n\nTo avoid legal objections o axing or reducing he climate divi­\n\ndend as a par of income axation as well as effects on he federal \n\nfiscal equalization, he ax authorities could carry ou he proposed \n\nprocedures on behalf of he federal government. The additional \n\nrevenue would hen flow in full o he federal government, if nec­\n\nessary minus a reimbursemen of administrative costs o he im­\n\nplementing ax authorities. This is unlike he case with income ax, \n\nwhere half of he additional revenue is paid o he federal states \n\nand municipalities.\n\nFigure\n\nDetermining he relevan annual ne income for he climate \n\ndividend reduction\n\n \n\n1 Taxpayers are weighted a 100 percent.

The responsibility for he conten of he study \n\nlies with he authors.\n\nTherefore, i seems reasonable o concentrate he climate \n\ndividend on low and middle-income households and indi­\n\nviduals. The funds saved by doing so can be used in a more \n\ntargeted manner o relieve groups with above-average bur­\n\ndens or hose experiencing particular hardship. Furthermore, \n\naccording o European legal requirements, revenue from he \n\nEU-ETS2 may only be used for programs aimed a decreas­\n\ning fossil energy consumption or leveling social disparities \n\nbetween low and middle-income households and higher-in­\n\ncome households beginning in 2027.\n\nAdjusting he climate dividend o recipients’ income \n\ndirectly a he ime of ransfer would be oo costly, as i \n\nwould require an income assessmen for all 84 million res­\n\nidents in Germany.

There is \n\na considerably greater burden on low-income households \n\nrelative o heir income han on high-income households. \n\nFor heating fuels (heating oil, natural gas, and liquefied gas), \n\nthe regressive effec of carbon pricing is significant, while \n\ni is much smaller for premium grade gas and nearly pro­\n\nportional for diesel.\n\nThese distributional effects will become accordingly stronger \n\nif he carbon price reaches levels of 100+ euros per on from \n\n2027 in he EU-ETS2. The actual distributional effects may \n\nbe even more severe, as poorer households frequently have \n\nfewer opportunities o reac o high energy prices. In con­\n\ntrast, rich households are increasingly performing energy-ef­\n\nficien refurbishmen on heir homes, installing new heat­\n\ning systems, or purchasing electric vehicles.\n\nFlat-rate per capita climate dividend relieves low-\n\nincome earners\n\nThe simulations firs accoun for he coverage of higher heat­\n\ning costs due o carbon pricing as a par of he basic income \n\nscheme as well as he carbon and climate components of he \n\n2021 and 2023 housing benefi reforms as relief for house­\n\nholds.14 To do so, we use a micro simulation model o esti­\n\nmate a relief volume of 1.0 billion euros in 2024. The remain­\n\ning governmen revenue from carbon pricing ha is availa­\n\nble for compensation declines accordingly.\n\nAs additional relief, we simulate a flat-rate per capita climate \n\ndividend ha is paid o all residents in Germany. We assume \n\ntha he amoun of he climate dividend is calculated based \n\non carbon pricing revenue from households, excluding VAT \n\nrevenue, which is estimated o be 10.4 billion euros (Table). \n\nWith 84 million residents, his results in a climate dividend \n\nof 124.09 euros per person per year.\n\nTo avoid double subsidies, coverage of high heating costs via \n\nthe basic income scheme and he increase in he housing \n\nbenefi are offse agains he climate dividend.

The Gini coeffi­\n\ncien for income inequality declines minimally more han \n\nwithou he reduction (Table).\n\nConclusion: Climate dividend urgently needed, \n\nespecially for low-income households\n\nCarbon pricing for fossil and heating fuels is a key instru­\n\nmen for achieving German and European climate argets. \n\nWithou a broad redistribution of revenue from carbon pric­\n\ning o households, i has a regressive effec on he income \n\ndistribution because i burdens low-income households rel­\n\native o heir income more han above-average and high- \n\nincome earners.\n\nIf here is a considerable increase in carbon pricing, which \n\nis expected during he ransition o he EU-ETS2, he intro­\n\nduction of a climate dividend will be all he more urgent, \n\na leas for low-income households. After all, many low-in­\n\ncome households do no have heir heating costs covered \n\nby he basic income scheme or do no receive he housing \n\nbenefi despite being eligible due o a lack of information \n\nand bureaucratic application procedures. The same applies \n\nto subsidy programs for decarbonization.\n\nPaying a climate dividend o he entire population entails a \n\nhigh fiscal burden for which here is no ye leeway in he \n\nClimate and Transformation Fund (KTF). This would require \n\nfunding programs o be cu funds o be made available from \n\nthe federal budget.\n\nA flat-rate per capita climate dividend paid o all residents \n\nwould also relieve above-average and high-income earners. \n\nThese groups are less strongly affected by carbon pricing \n\nand generally have more opportunities o reduce heir fos­\n\nsil fuel energy consumption. These opportunities are sup­\n\nported generously by subsidy programs, which also mostly \n\nhave a strongly regressive effect. Therefore, i makes sense \n\nto concentrate he climate dividend on low and middle-in­\n\ncome households in he long erm, so long as i is echni­\n\ncally and politically feasible.\n\nSince determining each resident’s income and adjusting he \n\nclimate dividend individually per person would be oo ime \n\nconsuming, axing he climate dividend is a good option, \n\nas i can be done so unbureaucratically. The application of \n\na specific ax rate function makes i possible for lower and \n\nmiddle-income households o receive he full climate div­\n\nidend while i is reduced significantly for higher-income \n\nhouseholds.\n\nThe funds freed up his way can be used for additional aid \n\nand suppor programs for decarbonization, especially for \n\n“vulnerable” households with low incomes and higher energy \n\nconsumption. This could contribute o increasing societal \n\nacceptance for noticeable carbon cos increases as well as \n\nsocietal suppor for an ambitious climate policy.\n\n259\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 43+44/2024\n\nCLIMATE DIVIDEND\n\nJEL: Q41, D31, H23\n\nKeywords: carbon pricing, climate dividend, redistribution\n\nStefan Bach is a Research Associate in he Public Economics Departmen \n\na DIW Berlin | sbach@diw.de\n\nMark Hamburg was a Studen Research Assistan a DIW Berlin\n\nSimon Meemken is a Research Officer a he Forum Ökologisch-Soziale \n\nMarktwirtschaf (FÖS) | simon.meemken@foes.de\n\nMarlene Merker was a Studen Research Assistan a DIW Berlin\n\nJoris Pieper is a Studen Research Assistan a DIW Berlin | jpieper@diw"
