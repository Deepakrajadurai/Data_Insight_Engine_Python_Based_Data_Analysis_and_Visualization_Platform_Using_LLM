    "Julia Rechlitz, and Claudia Kemfert ABSTRACT Large parts of he existing natural gas distribution networks mus be decommissioned due o he decarbonization of the hea supply. However, here are neither regulatory nor economic incentives for he gas network operators o do so and delaying he decommissioning could be expensive for he remaining customers. This Weekly Repor analyzes o wha exten municipalities can partially decommission he natural gas infrastructure with he help of municipal hea planning and by re-municipalizing he gas industry. This study also outlines he challenges associated with hese instruments. Accordingly, re-municipalization does no necessarily resul in he gas networks being decommissioned faster, a fac ha remains unconsidered in he existing hea plans. Furthermore, the curren regulatory framework, which is based on cos effi­ ciency and he obligation o connect, makes decommissioning more difficult. In addition, he municipalities have a financial incentive o continue generating revenue from gas, partially because alternative income sources for funding public ser­ vices are unavailable. Thus, he regulation mus be adjusted and he federal and state governments mus provide more suppor for he municipalities in organizing he partial decom­ missioning of he natural gas infrastructure. Germany has long relied on natural gas for residential heat­ ing. In 2020, he share of natural gas heating was 45 percent, with around 522,000 kilometers of natural gas distribution networks in operation.1 Large amounts are invested into net­ work expansion and maintenance every year: In 2019, he around 700 gas distribution network operators in Germany2 invested 1.5 billion euros in he networks.3 The Ac on Hea Planning and he Decarbonization of the Hea Networks (Gesetz für die Wärmeplanung und die Dekarbonisierung der Wärmenetze), which came into force on January 1, 2024, is mean o accelerate he hea ransition. Its aim is a gradual decline in he use of natural gas hrough renovations, increasing electrification, and he expansion of distric heating. Even in scenarios with a high share of synthetic gases such as hydrogen, long-term scenarios for the energy ransition in Germany predic a decline in use of he gas distribution networks (Figure 1).4 Thus, parts of the networks will no longer be able o be operated econom­ ically.5 Organizing he decommissioning6 of he natural gas networks and coordinating i with he developmen of other energy networks, such as electricity and distric heating, will be central o he municipal hea ransition. In his Weekly Report, differen possibilities for dealing with the challenges of he hea ransition are considered, such as the buy-back of natural gas networks or he municipal hea plans ha are now required; o do so, we analyze he hea plans already in place in some municipalities in Baden- Wür emberg. This analysis also includes interviews with 1 Bundesnetzagentur and Bundeskartellamt, Monitoringberich 2020. Repor (2021) (in German; available online. Accessed on March 5, 2024.

Municipalities wan o influence natural gas distribution networks via re-municipalization One way for local authorities o handle he hea ransition is to buy back he natural gas networks. However, his is no an uncontroversial undertaking. Recently, Hamburg bough back he energy networks and Berlin is also considering pur­ chasing its local gas utility.7 Municipalities have various expectations related o re-mu­ nicipalization ha may no materialize in practice. On he one hand, hey wan o accelerate he energy ransition and influence he gas utilities accordingly. However, his objec­ tive conflicts with he regulatory framework, which stipulates an obligation o connec households and, hus, restricts any network downsizing (Box 1). In addition, he municipalities will have o amortize heir investments and municipal com­ panies will operate under a profit-oriented approach. The more and he longer hey sell natural gas, he higher he profits. Thus, he financial prospects often ge in he way of taking climate action. Two paths o re-municipalization Municipalities have wo options for re-municipalizing he energy networks. First, a municipality can apply with a municipal company when a new concession is awarded. The Energy Industry Ac (Energiewirtschaftsgesetz, EnWG) applies o he selection of he future concession holder when awarding a new concession (Box 1). The endering proce­ dure mus be non-discriminatory. The municipal company is no guaranteed o be awarded he concession rights in he tender procedure. If he concession rights are ransferred o another company, he former concession holder is entitled to appropriate remuneration for he network, which can be based on future revenue. Alternatively, municipalities can purchase he gas network operator ha holds he concession rights. The State of Berlin, for example, is considering purchasing shares of he gas util­ ity Gasag.8 The advantage of his is he continuity of opera­ tions, as he gas utility would remain intac and he knowl­ edge required o operate he network would be retained. However, such a purchase involves risks, as he municipality would ake on he company’s obligations while future prof­ its are difficul o predic in he ransition phase of he heat­ ing and energy markets. To determine he purchase price, municipalities mus evaluate he energy sector conditions, such as future gas demand, he amoun of hydrogen avail­ able regionally, and he expected",
    "fuel and carbon prices. 7 Philipp Herpich, Franziska Holz, and Konstantin Löffler, “Wärmewende in Berlin: Versorgungs­ sicherhei nach dem Erdgas mi erneuerbaren Energien gewährleisten,” DIW Wochenberich no. 49 (2023) (in German; available online). 8 CDU and SPD, Koalitionsvertrag 2023-2026 (2023). Das Beste für Berlin (in German; available online). The key assumptions on which a purchase is based should be published because such a purchase involves public funds tha will hen be unavailable for he energy ransition. I mus be aken into accoun ha in he future, hydrogen will only replace a fraction of he amoun of natural gas ha is cur­ rently being consumed (Figure 2). There is a broad scien­ tific consensus ha hydrogen is no suitable for use in res­ idential heating because i will be scarce, expensive, and inefficient.9 The political recognition of hese problems is reflected in he National Hydrogen Strategy, which does no 9 Jan Rosenow, “Is heating homes with hydrogen all bu a pipe dream? An evidence review,” Joule 10, no. 6 (2022): 2225-2228 (available online). Figure 1 Long-term forecas of he energy demand for buildings, including electricity and distric heating demand in he building sector in Germany In erawa hours Sources: Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (2021); authors’ depiction. © DIW Berlin 2024 Residential hea demand will decline as a resul of renovations and other energy efficiency measures. In contrast, he demand for electricity and distric heating will increase. 112 DIW Weekly Repor 13+14/2024 HEAT TRANSITION clearly repudiate he use of hydrogen in residential heating bu recognizes ha he use of hydrogen in buildings has largely been rejected and will only be considered in a few individual cases.10 Re-municipalization: Conflic of interes between climate action and profi generation The mere political will for re-municipalization is insuffi­ cient. If municipalities are considering re-municipalization, the sum hey mus pay o he former concession holder sig­ nificantly influences he purchase decision. The purchase price determines how much natural gas mus be sold in he future in order o amortize he investments. In Hamburg, i ook en years following he purchase o recover one hird of he costs.11 In he future, however, here will be no ime for municipal­ ities o amortize he investments. According o climate ar­ gets, carbon emissions mus decrease. Thus, natural gas can only be delivered until 2045 a he lates and consumption will decline well before hen. This fac mus be reflected in the purchase decision and price; otherwise, municipalities 10 Bundesregierung, Fortschreibung der Nationalen Wasserstoffstrategie (2023) (in German; available online). 11 Andreas Dassel, Zehn Jahre Rückkauf der Energienetze. Ein Gewinn für Hamburg und das Klima (2023) (in German; available online). will be paying high sums for fossil infrastructure and will lack funds in other areas for he energy ransition. In any case, he decision o re-municipalize should be included in a municipal hea plan ha clearly sets ou he remaining gas volumes and provides a framework for he operation of he remaining network. The hea plan should also consider",
    "he foreseeable lack of hydrogen and he decline in hea demand overall (Figure 3). The municipalities are experiencing a conflic of interest, as hey mus choose between climate action and natural gas profits following re-municipalization. In addition, he reg­ ulatory framework prescribing a general obligation o con­ nec ensures ha decommissioning of parts of he gas net­ work is hardly possible. This prevents more climate action even if a municipal company is operating he gas network. These requirements are laid ou in he EnWG (Box 1) and thus canno be influenced by he municipalities. Municipal hea planning should be used o plan he decommissioning of natural gas distribution networks The Ac on Hea Planning and he Decarbonization of he Hea Networks came into effec on January 1, 2024.12 Its 12 Hea Planning Ac (Wärmeplanungsgesetz), (in German; available online). Box 1 Regulatory framework for natural gas distribution networks From an economic viewpoint, natural gas networks, like all pipe­ line-based infrastructure, are natural monopolies. This means ha the construction and operation of one network is more efficien than he construction of multiple networks due o he high fixed costs and relatively low operating costs. Natural gas networks in the European Union are subjec o regulation o ensure ha nat­ ural monopolies do no exploi heir advantage a he expense of consumers with high prices and low investments.1 The regulation of he natural gas networks adheres o hree basic principles: non-discriminatory access for natural gas sellers o he pipeline network, he unbundling of he network companies from the natural gas sellers, and he regulation of network charges and profits. A regulatory authority monitors he compliance with hese principles; for he distribution network operators, his body is ei­ ther he Federal Network Agency or he state regulatory authority. Network fee regulation is mandated in Germany as an incentive regulation, meaning i aims o provide an incentive for network operators o operate efficiently.2 To his end, efficiency compar­ 1 Implementation in Germany is regulated in he EnWG. 2 Cf. Regulation on he incentive regulation of he energy supply networks (ARegV) (in German; available online); Astrid Cullmann e al., “No Barriers o Investmen in Electricity and Gas Distribu­ tion Grids hrough Incentive Regulation,” DIW Weekly Repor no. 6 (2015) (available online). isons are performed between similar companies.3 The similarity is determined using structural parameters such as he number of connections. The concession contracts for gas distribution networks are award­ ed as an easemen contrac for an entire municipal area for up o 20 years.4 Concession holders mus ensure ha gas networks are safely operated and expanded, provided his can be done econom­ ically. In particular, here is an obligation o fulfill all connection requests within he municipality, i.e., o build new pipelines and connections if necessary (general obligation o connect).5 The mu­ nicipalities can also ake additional local community ma ers into accoun in he enders for he concession contracts. However, he federal objectives of he obligation o connec and cos efficiency take priority over municipal-specific",
    "argets such as climate action. 3 In contras o incentive regulation, pure cost-based regulation (cost-plus regulation) would stipulate for all costs o be offse and hus provide an incentive for unnecessary investments. 4 Section 46 of he EnWG. 5 Section 18 of he EnWG. 113 DIW Weekly Repor 13+14/2024 HEAT TRANSITION aim is o make he hea supply greenhouse gas neutral and to provide suppor in achieving climate argets by 2045. I requires all municipalities in Germany with more han 100,000 inhabitants o develop a hea plan by mid-2026. All municipalities with fewer han 100,000 inhabitants have until mid-2028 o carry ou heir hea planning and municipali­ ties with fewer han 10,000 inhabitants are subjec o sim­ plified planning requirements. The planning process con­ tains seven steps, and he plan mus be reviewed or contin­ ued every five years (Figure 4). Various stakeholders, such as natural gas or hea network operators and representatives of public interests, are o be involved in he process. The Hea Planning Ac provides access o previously un avail­ able data, for example data from energy companies and he associations of he craftsman and chimney sweeps, abou con­ nections o he natural gas network, heating systems, or con­ sumption. This new data makes i possible for municipalities to ake a leading role in hea planning and its coordination. Hea planning can contribute o overcoming he insuffi­ cien planning for he hea ransition, o creating investmen security for renewable energy infrastructure and o adjust­ ing consumers’ expectations. Ideally, hea plans would con­ tain clear statements on he medium and long-term natu­ ral gas coverage of a neighborhood. Natural gas customers would hen know by when hey would have o replace heir gas heating and natural gas network operators would be able to make heir investments with foresigh and make argeted investments in maintenance where he networks are in oper­ ation for longer.13 Such a planned approach o he decommis­ sioning of he gas distribution networks is recommended bu no required in he Hea Planning Act. The following analysis of municipal hea planning in some municipali­ ties in Baden-Wür emberg shows ha he municipalities canno be expected o directly address natural gas grids and their decommissioning in heir hea planning. Baden-Wür emberg has already implemented municipal hea planning The firs state in Germany o implemen hea planning was Baden-Wür emberg, where i has been mandatory for large municipalities since December 2020. Its municipalities mus presen heir hea plans by he end of 2023. An evaluation of hese initial experiences in Baden-Wür emberg provides insights into implementation ha is relevan for he res of Germany. The data for his analysis are from interviews with 20 representatives of he mos importan interes groups of the hea ransition in Baden-Wür emberg as well as five sci­ entific experts.14 Representatives of public utilities, network 13 When planning he gradual decommissoning, risk-determining factors should be aken into account, such as he age of he network, high upcoming maintenance investments, he expected decline in",
    "gas consumption due o distric modernization, he advanced age of he gas boilers, an­ chor customers for distric heating, and upcoming civil engineering measures ha could favor he relocation of heating networks. 14 The detailed evaluation of he interviews is available in Isabell Branger, “Communal hea plan­ ning: Overcoming he path-dependency of natural gas in residential heating?” Environmental Inno­ vation and Societal Transitions, Vol. 48 (2023): 100768 (available online).

Hy­ drogen will no play a role in he building sector. 114 DIW Weekly Repor 13+14/2024 HEAT TRANSITION Uncertainty is only one reason why municipalities in Baden- Wür emberg are no sufficiently aking into accoun he decommissioning of he natural gas distribution networks. Municipalities also face economic and regulatory barriers during planning and implementation. While he results are from interviews conducted in Baden-Wür emberg, hey provide insights into he framework conditions ha apply nationwide and are hus formulated generally and relevan for municipalities in other German states. Decommissioning natural gas networks reduces municipal revenues So far, he business models of municipal energy and hea utilities have been significantly based on he sales of natu­ ral gas.16 In 2017, public utilities employed hree imes more employees in natural gas operations han in distric heating operations;17 i can be assumed ha his ratio has no changed much over he pas years. Utilities mus develop new com­ petencies, strategies, and business models for he hea ran­ sition. The interviews show ha adjusting business models can lead o conflicting objectives, especially when i comes to expanding distric heating in areas with an existing nat­ ural gas network. Indeed, in many municipalities, he profits of he public gas utilities have been used o cross-finance other public servic­ es.18 A decline in profits from a municipal gas utility could lead o financial challenges for he municipalities.19 If he natural gas network belongs o a private operator, he municipal budge loses ou on income from concession fees.20 Concession fees are an importan source of revenue, especially for smaller municipalities. Many municipalities, therefore, have li le interes in he end of he natural gas sec­ tor, as one of he interviewees pointed out. A he same ime, the municipalities have he opportunity o ake an active role in designing municipal hea planning. Partial decommissioning of natural gas infrastructure is limited by existing regulation The",
    "existing (incentive) regulation of natural gas distribu­ tion networks is designed o expand and maintain he net­ works, while reducing he size of he networks has no been possible o date. As long as here are even isolated connec­ tions, existing networks mus remain in operation.21 16 Isabel Schrems and Lorena Eulgem, Die Rolle des Erdgasgeschäfts von Stadtwerken für die kommunale Daseinsvorsorge – Eine Fallstudienanalyse (2022) (in German; available online). 17 Thomas Bruckner e al., “Kommunale Energieversorger: Gewinner oder Verlierer der Energie­ wende?” Wiso Diskurs 04 (2017) (in German; available online). 18 Cf.

However, hey are deducted from he profits of he municipal company and reduce he amoun of revenue ha can be used o finance public services. 21 Energiewirtschaftsgesetz, EnWG, sections 11, 17, 18, and 20 (in German; available online). operators, energy agencies, and he State Ministry of Food, Rural Affairs and Consumer Protection were interviewed (Box 2). In addition, six published hea plans from munici­ palities in Baden-Wür emberg were analyzed. Hea plans do no sufficiently consider he decline of natural gas consumption The evaluation of hea plans from Baden-Wür emberg shows tha hey have no sufficiently aken into accoun he need o decommission natural gas distribution networks. Concrete decommissioning plans, for example by classifying priority areas, are no included in he hea plans. The plans do no explicitly state when he natural gas distribution networks are likely o be decommissioned, even for areas designated as priority areas for distric heating supply. The actors ascribe this o a high level of uncertainty regarding he future avail­ ability of renewable gases such as hydrogen.15 As a result, natural gas customers remain unsure as o how long hey will be able o continue o operate heir gas heating despite the existing hea plans. 15 See, for example, he municipal hea plan of he Landkreis Lörrach (in German; available on- line). Box 2 Analysis of actors in Baden-Wür emberg The data for his analysis come from interviews with 20 rep­ resentatives of he mos importan interes groups of he hea transition in Baden-Wür emberg as well as five scientific ex­ perts. Among hose interviewed were representatives of public utilities, network operators, energy agencies, municipal actors, and he State Ministry of Food, Rural Affairs and Consumer Protection. The semi-structured interviews were conducted between October and December 2021 and evaluated using a qualitative conten analysis.1 In addition, six hea plans from Baden-Wür emberg were analyzed from he municipalities of Lörrach, Freiburg, Giengen, Baden-Baden, Obersontheim, and Kirchheim-Unterteck. The municipal hea plans for hese municipalities were completed and available online by he end of 2023. The analysis is based on a matrix ha focuses on he future developmen of he gas network in he hea plan and investigates differen qualitative dimensions. These dimensions include defining areas with declining gas demand, identifying and explaining he risk factors involved",
    "in decommissioning he gas network, and developing concrete measures for decommissioning. In addi­ tion, where available, he more general discussion of he issue was evaluated. 1 Jochen Gläser and Gri Laudel, Experteninterviews und qualitative Inhaltsanalyse: als Instrumente rekonstruierender Untersuchungen, 4th ed. (2010: VS Verlag für Sozialwissen­ schaften) (in German; available online). 115 DIW Weekly Repor 13+14/2024 HEAT TRANSITION The maintenance and operation costs of he networks are passed on o he connected gas customers. If customers suc­ cessively switch o a renewable hea supply in he future, he network charges will increase for he ever-fewer remaining gas customers.22 This could reduce he acceptance of he hea ransition, for example among renters who do no have a choice in heir heating system and are forced o assume the rising network charges. The concession contracts between municipalities and gas net­ work operators se he framework for developments in he network. However, municipalities have very li le influence on large parts of he conten of he concession contracts. The concession area always covers he entire municipal area by law and reducing it, for example due o he municipal hea plan, is no possible. Concessions are awarded exclusively according o legally defined economic criteria, while criteria such as climate action have previously no been permi ed.23 According o he EnWG, gas distribution network operators mus amortize he networks over 45 o 55 years.24 Premature decommissioning leads o uncovered investmen costs and requires value adjustments, leaving companies with stranded 22 Agora Energiewende, Ein neuer Ordnungsrahmen für die Erdgasverteilnetze (2023) (in German; available online). 23 Julian Senders, “Wärmeplanung und Gaskonzessionen: Eine Untersuchung der bestehenden kommunalen Spielräume in der Wärmeplanung unter besonderer Berücksichtigung von Wärme­ netzen,” Würzburger Studien zum Umweltenergierecht, no. 27 (2022) (in German; available online). 24 Section 46 of he EnWG. assets on heir balance sheets.25 In Germany, 55 percen of he pipelines were buil or renewed between 1990 and 2020; hey would be only partially depreciated by 2045.26 The Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) has recognized he need o adjus he expected operating life and depreciation procedures and has begun a consultation process o do so.27 This is an importan step in advancing he decommission­ ing of he natural gas distribution network. Hea planning process mus be improved The statutory obligation of hea planning creates a responsi­ bility in he municipalities o coordinate he hea ransition. In he interviews, however, various stakeholders pointed ou tha staffing levels are low in mos municipalities and ha he developmen of additional capacities is no sufficiently guar­ anteed due o low compensation funding for he hea plan­ ning. This can lead o a lack of continuity in hea planning and implementation as well as o knowledge asymmetries vis-a-vis non-municipal actors, hus leading o municipal interests being insufficiently represented. In addition, in he planning process in Baden-Wür emberg i is no mandatory o include key actors and he public; 25 Vei Bürger e al., Agenda Wärmewende 202.

Figure 4 Central elements of municipal hea planning Source: Hea Planning Act; authors’ depiction. © DIW Berlin 2024 The Hea Planning Ac requires municipalities o prepare a hea plan by either 2026 or 2028. 116 DIW Weekly Repor 13+14/2024 HEAT TRANSITION accordingly, no funds are prescribed for such stakeholder consultations. In he interviews, civil society actors described the process as opaque due o he lack of participation oppor­ tunities. A major advantage of municipal hea planning is tha both specialists and he general public can be involved, thereby creating acceptance for he ransition a an early stage. Therefore, municipalities should be encouraged and supported as much as possible in exploiting his advantage. Conclusion: Timely decommissioning of he network no ye guaranteed The demand for natural gas for residential heating will decline over he nex years. Natural gas distribution net­ works mus be gradually decommissioned so ha network charges do no become oo expensive for he few remain­ ing customers. Municipal hea planning is a firs importan step in accelerating he hea ransition and is, in heory, a good instrumen for planning he decommissioning of nat­ ural gas distribution networks. However, he evaluation of the firs hea plans shows ha he municipalities are ignor­ ing he future of gas networks, citing major uncertainties. In addition, neither municipal nor private gas network owners have any economic interes in decommissioning, nor have there been any regulatory incentives o do so. The EnWG prioritizes cos efficiency and he obligation o connec over climate action. However, climate action should be placed on equal footing with hese other objectives in order o make i possible o decommission he gas distribution networks. The consultation on he future of he natural gas distribu­ tion networks launched by he German governmen in March 2024 and parallel processes a he Federal Network Agency are steps in he righ direction.28 Municipal owners are facing he same limitations due o regulations and a lack of economic incentives, which make decommissioning natural gas networks hard. The re-mu­ nicipalization of gas networks ha were previously privately owned is hus no a necessary prerequisite o making he hea supply climate-friendly. Municipalities and public util­ ities will need suppor services in he future o adequately compensate for he decline in he natural gas demand. Such suppor can include, for example, he developmen of new financing concepts for he provision of public services. In addition, municipalities should be encouraged o develop a clear roadmap for he existing natural gas distribution net­ work infrastructure, even if his has no ye been explicitly required in he Hea Planning Act. 28 Cf.
