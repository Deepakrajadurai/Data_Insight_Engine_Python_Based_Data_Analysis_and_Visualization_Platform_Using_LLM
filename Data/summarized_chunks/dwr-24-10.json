Inflation, which is falling in both Germany",
    "and he euro area overall, is expected o return close o he European Central Bank's wo-percen arget, suggesting ha a urnaround in interes rates can be expected in early summer. Be er financ­ ing conditions and he slowdown in price momentum are likely to somewha boos both private consumption as well as corpo­ rate investments over he course of 2024. Nevertheless, here is currently still a grea deal of uncertainty, particular in regard to he future economic policy environment, which is causing households and companies o remain cautious in Germany. In addition, fiscal policy stimuli as well as foreign demand are lacking. German GDP will virtually stagnate and, carried by private consumption and public investments in equipment, increase more markedly by 1.2 percen in 2025. The global economy will continue o develop more robustly han Ger­ many; i is projected o increase by 3.5 percen in both 2024 and 2025, which should gradually strengthen German exports. Global economy: Industry fighting its way ou of a slump, geopolitical risks are high The global economy expanded by 3.9 percen in 2023 (Figure 1). Growth is subdued compared o historical stand­ ards, bu nevertheless robus given he prevailing challenges. In many places, high energy prices, higher interes rates, a loss of purchasing power due o inflation, and geopolitical crises and uncertainties weighed on economic development. In mos countries, his weakened he industrial sector in par­ ticular, while services fared somewha be er. The advanced economies, especially he United States, did provide a boos o he global economy. The US economy experienced a surprisingly strong expansion of 2.5 percen (Table 1). Comprehensive fiscal policy stimuli from 2020 o 2022 continued o suppor private consumption and corpo­ rate investments. Of he emerging economies, China con­ tributed significantly o global growth: The Chinese econ­ omy grew by 5.2 percen in 2023. Compared o he pre-pan­ demic years, however, his growth was considerably weaker. In 2023, he recovery following he zero COVID policy was overshadowed by lasting problems in he real estate sector in particular. The Mexican economy grew by 3.2 percen in 2023, although exports o he United States have no been as dynamic of late. The Brazilian economy grew by 3.1 per­ cent, in par hanks o strong harvests and exports in he firs half of 2023. The Indian economy expanded by a powerful 6.9 percen in 2023 due o solid domestic demand. The European economy, in contrast, stagnated overall, stalled by he energy price crisis and restrictive monetary policy. With growth of only 0.5 percent, he euro area contributed lit­ tle o global economic growth in 2023. The United Kingdom fell into a echnical recession in he second half of 2023, meaning i experienced wo back-to-back quarters of declin­ ing economic outpu (by 0.1 and 0.3 percent). The aftermath of he cos of living crisis weighed heavily on growth in he UK hroughou 2023.1 The Japanese economy expanded by 1 Cf.

High inflation here is also weigh­ ing on domestic demand in particular. Only he rade bal­ ance was positive because exports grew more strongly han imports due o he weak yen. The global economy is likely o grow relatively robustly in the firs quarter of 2024. The Purchasing Managers' Indices for manufacturing have recorded an upward rend in mos advanced economies recently, despite he fac ha he major euro area Member States and he UK are still below the expansion hreshold. In he emerging economies, he Purchasing Managers' Index for China (Caixin) has been above he expansion hreshold since November 2023 and in Brazil since December 2023. Industry, which has been weak globally, should hus gradually overcome his slump. However, manufacturing continues o be weak, especially in Japan and Germany. While his is due o he high costs for imports given he weak yen and subdued domestic demand in Japan, high energy prices and weak foreign demand are weighing on he developmen in Germany. In he United States, growth is likely o slow somewha o 0.5 percen (annualized 1.9 percent) in he firs quarter of 2024. The South Korean economy is expanding a a simi­ lar rate, driven by strong semiconductor exports. The euro area as well as he UK are likely o gradually recover, with quarterly growth of 0.1 percent. Japan's economy is likely o only grow by 0.4 percen due o persistently high inflation. In mos emerging economies, in contrast, strong growth is expected in he firs quarter of 2024 (Table 1). In China, consumers spen considerably more money around he Lunar New Year holiday as compared o before he pan­ demic; ouris raffic and ourism expanded as well. The Chinese economy is likely o expand by 1.0 percen in he firs quarter of 2024. Economic outpu in he Central and Eastern European countries of he European Union will likely expand by 0.7 percen in he firs quarter of 2024 due to falling inflation rates and stronger consumption, a slightly greater increase han recently. International rade will probably experience only moderate growth in 2024. Although he supply bo lenecks of recen years have eased, more expensive ransportation costs can­ no be ruled ou due o he conflicts in he Red Sea and he drough in he Panama Canal. International rade declined by 1.9 percen in 2023. Monetary policy in many advanced economies, excep for Japan, will remain restrictive a he beginning of 2024. However, as inflations rates are falling in he euro area, the European Central Bank is expected o make its firs key interes rate cu in early summer. Lending o households has also stabilized recently.2 In he United States, inflation did no decline further in January 2024,",
    "primarily due o 2 Cf. Deutsche Bundesbank, \"Geldpolitik und Geldmarktentwicklung,\" Monatsberich Februar (2024) (in German; available online). higher living costs. Thus, an initial interes rate decrease in March, as widely expected by financial markets, is no longer likely. In many emerging economies, monetary policy has already been loosened: The Chinese central bank lowered the five-year key interes rate for mortgages, a further sup­ portive measure for he country’s struggling real estate sec­ tor. Weak domestic demand is also reflected by a deflation­ ary rend in China, where prices fell by a further 0.8 per­ cen in January 2024. Fiscal policy will likely only provide moderate stimuli for he economy during he forecas period. In ligh of higher inter­ es rates, many governments are holding back on additional spending, partly o comply with fiscal defici and deb rules. However, he federal defici remains high in he United States and will be considerably above five percen of economic out­ pu in 2024 and 2025. In he United Kingdom, further fiscal measures ha appeal o voters are o be expected given he forthcoming British general election, mos likely in he form of further ax relief for companies. Medium-term investmen packages are likely o continue o suppor economic growth in he advanced economies. Overall, he global economy is expected o grow by 3.5 per­ cen in 2024; growth in he advanced economies is likely o be 1.5 percent. The upcoming urnaround in interes rates will probably have a positive impac on investmen activity in many countries. In he euro area, continued increases in real wages will provide stronger momentum o private con­ sumption. In he United States, household savings from he Figure 1 Growth of real GDP Quarter-on-quarter percentage growth (lef axis); index 2015 Q1 = 100 (righ axis) Sources: National Statistical Offices; DIW Berlin Economic Outlook Winter 2023. © DIW Berlin 2024 The expected urnaround in interes rates should have a positive impac on global economic developmen from he second half of 2024. 88 DIW Weekly Repor 10+11/2024 DIW BERLIN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK COVID relief measures are expected o continue dwindling and be depleted by mid-year. However, rising real wages are likely o suppor consumption even after he fiscal stimulus expires in he second half of 2024. In he emerging econo­ mies, economic outpu will likely increase by 4.7 percen in 2024. China's persisten problems in he real estate sector, weak domestic demand, and deflationary rends, as well as ongoing rade ensions with he United States, are likely o limi growth o below five percent. Russia is continuing o conver its economy o a war economy, as arms-related sec­ tors are expanding strongly. Overall, Russia's economic out­ pu is likely o increase as a result.3 3 Cf.

After economic outpu stagnated for hree quarters in 2023, i fell in he final quarter, down by 0.3 percen quarter on quarter, and in he year as a whole by 0.3 percen as well. While for­ eign demand declined due o weak global industrial produc­ tion, repeated interes rate hikes by he European Central Bank (ECB) and high inflation rates dampened domestic demand. Although consumer prices have had almos con­ sistently lower growth rates since he beginning of 2023, in particular due o falling energy prices, he annual average inflation rate was still 5.9 percent. Nevertheless, high wage agreements over he course of 2023 led o a sligh increase in real wages. However, his increase could no compensate for consumers’ previous loss of pur­ chasing power. The developmen of incomes and prices led to lasting uncertainty, which dampened consumer senti­ men and caused private consumption o fall markedly in 2023 as a whole. Rising nominal interes rates are also pro­ viding incentives o save, which has further increased he already high savings rate. Financing costs also rose due o he interes rate hikes and dampened investmen activity of private households and enterprises. Construction investments in particular declined considerably, especially due o weakening private residen­ tial construction. A he same ime, investments in equip­ men likely benefited from he high order backlog, a resul of he recovery following he coronavirus pandemic, and increased overall. In contrast, weak foreign demand weighed on exports. However, as imports declined even more sharply due o high energy prices and low demand for foreign inter­ mediary goods from domestic industry, he rade balance was positive. Despite he weak economic situation, employmen reached an all-time high with an annual average of 45.9 million people in employment. Primarily migration made his employmen growth possible. The additional jobs in healthcare, educa­ tion, and public administration created by he federal, state, and local governments also played a role. Simultaneously, the number of registered unemployed increased and he unemploymen rate grew from 5.3 percen in 2022 o 5.7 per­ cen in 2023. The gross value added, especially in manufacturing, was in decline over he second half of 2023. Energy-intensive sec­ tors in particular suffered due o he permanently height­ ened energy prices. Weak star o 2024 The same factors are still expected o weigh on he German economy in he firs quarter of 2024, resulting in a 0.1-percen decline in economic outpu (Figure 2). Thus, he German economy will likely contrac for he hird quarter in a row (Table 2).4 Nominal wages and disposable income continue heir strong upward rend and inflation rates are declining more and more, which results in higher purchasing",
    "power. Nevertheless, consumer sentimen among private house­ holds remains subdued and is characterized by uncertainty abou economic developments.5 This can be seen in, for example, he GfK-Konsumklimaindex, which is currently stag­ nating in he negatives. Retail sales also declined again in January 2024. Thus, private consumption is likely o experi­ ence only minimal growth and will be unable o preven a decline in GDP in he firs quarter of 2024 (Table 2). In contrast, sligh negative stimuli are expected from invest­ ments in he firs quarter of 2024. While manufacturers of capital goods still have a large stock of existing orders, new orders are rending downward; only some bulk orders are interrupting his rend. The ifo Business Climate Index for Germany is also no suggesting he situation will improve in he shor erm. Thus, investments in equipmen are likely to fall in he firs quarter of 2024. In he area of construction 4 Economic performance already began declining in he hird quarter of 2023, even if only marginally by 0.01 percent. Thus, he German economy has been in a echnical recession since he fourth quarter of 2023. 5 For example, he Economic Policy Uncertainty Index for Germany has increased noticeably since May 2023 and has since remained markedly above he overall European index values.

In ligh of a historically low number of incoming orders and building permits as well as a stagnation in new credi volume, a continued marked decline is expected here. Only non-residential construction (especially civil engi­ neering) may have a supporting effec and somewha cush­ ion he renewed decline in construction investment. As of he beginning of 2024, foreign rade is also no pro­ viding any growth stimuli; both imports as well as exports are likely o decline in he firs quarter and no contribute o economic outpu overall. While a majority of he Purchasing Managers’ Indices in other European countries are rending upward again, he values are often still in he negatives. A recovery in foreign industrial production, which could ben­ efi German exports, is herefore unlikely o materialize in the firs quarter, meaning ha exports will probably continue to decline. Furthermore, leading",
    "indicators for he German manufacturing industry, such as capacity utilization and he German Purchasing Managers’ Index, sugges ha imports of intermediary goods may also decline again (Figure 3). Consumption picking up speed, supported by investments From he second quarter of 2024, factors weighing on domes­ tic and foreign demand should begin o weaken. Following the decline in inflation rates in 2023, which was primarily due o falling energy prices, weakening price pressure on food and non-energy goods will likely have a greater effec on inflation in 2024. Overall, inflation in Germany and in the euro area is expected o reach he ECB’s wo-percen targe within 2024. The European Central Bank is here­ fore expected o herald a urnaround in interes rates a he end of he second quarter. Falling interes rates are likely to decrease financing costs for companies and households and make saving more una ractive. Simultaneously, indus­ try worldwide will slowly crawl ou of its slump and stimu­ late foreign demand. Private consumption is likely o be he main driver of he economic upswing for he remainder of he forecas period. The continuing slowdown in price momentum, which will strengthen consumer confidence, will probably make a key contribution o his. Real wages are expected o continue o rise, gradually over he forecas horizon, compensating for he loss of purchasing power in he pas years. After wages rose in many cases due o one-off inflation adjustmen premiums in 2023, sustainable wage increases according o pay scales are likely o increasingly come into effec in 2024. This is likely to positively influence households’ income security and boos consumption. Falling nominal interes rates are also likely o lead o a decline in he savings rate and a significan increase in private households’ propensity o consume in 2025. Declining financing costs are likely o have only a delayed impac on residential construction, meaning ha construction Table 2 Quarterly data on he developmen of use and value-added components of real GDP in Germany In percen (quarter-on-quarter, seasonally and calendar adjusted) 2023 2024 2025 I II III IV I II III IV I II III IV Private consumption −0.6 0.2 −0.0 0.2 0.1 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.2 0.2 Public consumption expenditure −1.4 −0.2 1.1 0.3 −0.2 0.0 0.4 0.5 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.3 Gross facilities investment 1.0 −0.0 0.1 −1.9 −0.5 −0.2 0.2 0.5 0.7 0.8 0.9 0.9 Construction 1.5 −0.5 −0.8 −1.7 −0.8 −0.4 −0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.6 0.7 Equipment 1.9 0.8 1.4 −3.5 −0.4 0.2 0.6 1.0 1.1 1.3 1.4 1.4 Other investment −1.6 −0.0 0.3 0.7 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 0.5 0.5 0.7 0.7 Inventory changes1 −0.5 0.5 −0.6 −0.1 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 Domestic consumption −0.9 0.6 −0.4 −0.3 −0.1 0.1 0.3 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.3 Ne exports 1.0 −0.5 0.3 0.0 0.0 −0.0 −0.0 −0.0 −0.0 −0.0 −0.1 −0.1 Exports −0.2 −0.9 −0.7 −1.6 −1.1 −0.1 0.3 0.6 0.7 0.7 0.6 0.6 Imports −2.2 0.1 −1.5 −1.7 −1.3 −0.1 0.4 0.7",

The sligh decline anticipated in construction prices from he record highs in recen years should hen also boos demand somewhat. Non-residential construction will probably continue o benefi primarily from investments in civil engineering, above all in rail and road construction, and preven an even greater slump in construction investment. Non-residential construction is expected o suppor momen­ tum in construction investmen in 2025 as well. Investments in equipmen over he course of he forecas period are expected o be significantly determined by pub­ lic defense spending and should be supporting economic growth in 2025 in particular. These investments are likely to massively increase in he second half of 2024 and in 2025 in particular as a par of he Bundeswehr’s special fund. Meanwhile, lower growth in acquisition expenditure is expected from private investors. For example, according o DIHK surveys, corporate willingness o inves has recently fallen repeatedly. This is due o, among other hings, uncer­ tainties regarding long-term economic policy, for example in regards o climate and ransition policy. As he economies of key German rading partners continue to recover, German exports are likely o increase again from the second half of 2024. Imports are also expected o increase, supported by he recovery in he manufacturing industry and the related strong foreign demand for intermediary goods. This demand will also be significantly stronger in 2025 due to he expansion of public investments in military equip­ men and will hen resul in a slightly negative rade balance. No clear stimuli are expected from fiscal policy measures in 2024. The reduced consumption axes on natural gas and in the food service industry expired a he beginning of 2024 and he CO2 surcharge was increased. Energy and electricity subsidies for private households will end in April. The larg­ es expansionary stimulus will probably come from a consid­ erable increase in defense spending in both 2024 and 2025. Overall, revenue is likely o increase more strongly han expenditure in 2024 and 2025. The",
    "public defici will likely decline from 1.2 in 2024 o 0.7 percen of GDP in 2025. The debt-to-GDP ratio according o he Maastrich Criteria is likely o fall from 63.6 o 62.6 percen of GDP. The manufacturing industry is likely o recover somewha over he course of 2024 hanks o momentum in investments and increase more considerably in 2025. Personal services such as retail and hospitality will be able o escape he weak phase of he pas years with he revival of private consump­ tion. Gross value added as a whole is also likely o increase over he course of he year, bu stagnate in annual erms. In 2025, i is likely o experience strong growth of 1.2 percent. The developmen on he production side is also likely o be supported by an increase in he labor volume, which itself will be supported by he continuous increase in employmen over 2024. The number of hours worked per employee is also likely o increase over he course of 2024, with a normaliza­ tion of he still significantly higher sick rate being he pri­ mary contributing factor. In he contex of a further increase in he number of hours worked in line with he pre-corona­ virus rend, a significan increase in he labor volume is also expected in 2025. However, he shortage of labor and skilled workers, which is intensifying as a resul of demographic change, is likely o have a limiting effect. In line with he eco­ nomic development, unemploymen is likely o rise moder­ ately a firs and hen fall again from he second half of 2024 onwards, meaning ha he unemploymen rate should still be 5.9 percen in 2024 and hen only 5.5 percen in 2025 (Table 3). I can be assumed ha he labor force potential will decline towards he end of he forecas horizon despite immigra­ tion and rising employmen rates, hus limiting potential output. Potential outpu is likely o grow a a rate of 0.5 per­ cen and 0.4 percen in 2024 and 2025, respectively. By he end of he 2020s, he rate should gradually fall o 0.3 per­ cent. The expected outpu gap hus will initially increase further o 1.5 percen in 2024 before falling considerably o 0.7 percen in 2025. Overall, real GDP will probably stagnate in 2024 despite he increasing momentum over he course of he year. A strong 1.2-percen increase is expected for 2025. This forecas is subjec o many uncertainty factors.
