This Weekly Report investigates how the \n\nshare of people living in Germany who send remittances \n\nabroad has changed over time according to their migration \n\nbackground (with or without a refugee background) and \n\nwhich factors influence the likelihood of remitting. Based on \n\nSocio-Economic Panel (SOEP) data as well as the IAB-SOEP \n\nMigration Samples and the IAB-BAMF-SOEP Refugee Survey \n\nfrom 2013 to 2022, the analysis shows that migrants without \n\na refugee background send remittances more often, while \n\nrefugees are often rarely able to send remittances due to \n\nstructural barriers. Thus, the political debate does not reflect \n\nreality. A person’s family situation and their intention to stay in \n\nGermany long term are particularly important factors influenc­\n\ning the likelihood that they will send remittances abroad. In \n\nthis respect, these results should contribute to a reevaluation \n\nof remittances, as they are an important instrument in achiev­\n\ning sustainable development goals, in stabilizing the economy \n\nin the migrants’ home countries, and reducing poverty.\n\nIn recent decades, the volume of the global flow of remit­\n\ntances sent by migrants has grown significantly and reached \n\nhistoric peaks. According to World Bank data based on cal­\n\nculations by central banks around the world, these remit­\n\ntance flows have developed into a significant income source \n\nfor many low and middle-income countries. These personal \n\ntransfers, referred to hereafter interchangeably as “personal \n\ntransfers” or “remittances,” help millions of families meet \n\ntheir basic needs and make an important contribution to local \n\neconomic development.1 Germany is also part of this global \n\ntrend: Since the 2000s, the country has recorded a continu­\n\ning increase of remittances sent abroad (Figure 1). By 2023, \n\nGermany was one of the top European nations in remit­\n\ntances sent, reaching over 24 billion dollars (22 billion euros).\n\nThis development reflects the change in migration ­dynamics \n\nthat Germany has experienced over the past two decades. \n\nSince 2000, the share of the population with a migration \n\nbackground2 has risen steadily. As of 2022, it was around \n\n25 percent of the population, or around 21 million people. \n\nThis increase is due both to the arrival of skilled migrants as \n\nwell as of asylum seekers from crisis regions such as Syria, \n\nAfghanistan, and Ukraine. As of 2023, a new record of around \n\n3.2 million asylum seekers are living in Germany.3 This situ­\n\nation reflects Germany’s humanitarian commitment, but has \n\nalso led to more debate on migration policy. Critical voices \n\ndemand stricter regulations, especially regarding accepting \n\nasylum seekers. One key argument in this discussion is the \n\n1\t\n\nDilip Ratha et al., Remittances Slowed in 2023, Expected to Grow Faster in 2024 (Washington, \n\nDC: World Bank, 2024) (available online. Accessed on November 2, 2024. This applies to all other \n\nonline sources in this report unless stated otherwise).\n\n2\t This Weekly Report does not differentiate between direct (born abroad) and indirect migration \n\n(at least one parent born abroad) backgrounds. Instead, both groups are considered migrants. We \n\nonly differentiate between non-migrants and migrants (with and without a refugee background). \n\nThe definition of migrants and their offspring is based on different characteristics that are avail­\n\nable in the SOEP dataset, such as country of birth, country of origin, year of migration, and oth­\n\ner information about their migration, cf. Miriam Gauer and Cornelia Kristen, “A guide to using the \n\nSOEP for Research on Individuals of Immigrant Origin: Samples and Contents of the SOEP-Core, \n\nIncluding the IAB-SOEP Migration Samples and the IAB-BAMF-SOEP Survey of Refugees, through \n\na Migration and Immigrant Integration Lens,” SOEP Survey Papers Series C., no. 1332 (2024) (avail­\n\nable online.

This presumption has already led to concrete \n\nregulatory measures: For example, a payment card system \n\nhas been introduced, which limits asylum seekers’ access to \n\ndisposable cash.4 The goal of this measure is to control the \n\nuse of state subsidies more strictly and to ensure that refu­\n\ngees are mainly using this money to support themselves in \n\nGermany.5 However, this debate ignores the positive effects \n\nthat remittances sent abroad have on the recipient countries.6\n\nThe increase in remittances and the related policy reactions \n\nemphasize the topic’s complexity: They illustrate how closely \n\nrelated economic aspects of migration and social policy chal­\n\nlenges and public discourse are. While these remittances are \n\nof great significance for the recipient countries, host socie­\n\nties face the challenge of addressing unsubstantiated con­\n\ncerns about public funds flowing abroad, while also ensur­\n\ning support and integration for refugees.\n\nHowever, the aggregated figures published by the World \n\nBank, which use Bundesbank data for Germany, do not pro­\n\nvide any insight into the amounts sent by migrants, especially \n\nrefugees, and non-migrants (Box). Thus, a detailed analysis \n\n4\t Cf. the details on the payment card on the German Federal Government's website \n\n(available online).\n\n5\t Herbert Brücker, “Eine Einschätzung der Bezahlkarte für Geflüchtete,” BIM Policy Brief no. 2 \n\n(2024) (available online).\n\n6\t Hillel Rapoport and Frédéric Docquier, “The Economics of Migrants' Remittances,” in \n\nHandbook of the Economics of Giving, Altruism, and Reciprocity, Vol. 2 (2006), 1135–1198 \n\n(available online).\n\nof remittances sent only by migrants based on Bundesbank \n\nfigures is not possible.7 Additionally, neither an individual’s \n\nspecific context nor their motives for sending remittances \n\nare recorded. This results in a certain unclarity, as the actual \n\nremittance amounts of the individual groups cannot be deter­\n\nmined. Moreover, remittances sent via informal channels are \n\noften not included or are underestimated, which further dis­\n\ntorts the overall figures.8\n\nFor a clearer understanding of who is sending remittances \n\nunder what conditions, we must analyze the trends in remit­\n\ntances and the driving factors behind them more closely. \n\nSuch an analysis provides not only a look at the economic \n\nrelationships and realities of migrants in Germany, but also \n\nreveals what motives and challenges are driving them to send \n\nfinancial support to their home countries. This closer look \n\nis decisive for making informed policy decisions and better \n\nunderstanding the effects of migration and financial flows \n\non societies, both sender and recipient countries.\n\nThis analysis is the first to use representative, longitudi­\n\nnal survey data from private households in Germany to \n\n7\t Jörg Feuerhake and Maria Pia Cobián, Personal transfers in the balance of payments: estima­\n\ntion under changing migration patterns (Bank für Internationalen Zahlungsausgleich, Irving Fisher \n\nCommittee on Central Bank Statistics: 2024) (available online).\n\n8\t Informal channels include unregulated methods, such as the Hawala system in which transac­\n\ntions are done on a trust basis, or having cash physically transported by a courier service. Infor­\n\nmal channels are often faster and more affordable, but carry risks such as money laundering and a \n\nlack of consumer protection. Official channels are regulated by financial institutions such as banks, \n\nmoney transfer services (such as Western Union), or mobile financial services (such as M-Pesa). \n\nCf. International Monetary Fund, “Understanding Remittances: Demography, Transaction Chan­\n\nnels, and Measurement,” in International Transactions in Remittances: Guide for Compilers and \n\n­Users (2008) (available online); and Andrea Friedrich, Jens Walter, and Birgit Zeitschel, The Ger­\n\nman remittance market – an overview (Deutsche Bundesbank: 2007) (in German; available online).\n\nFigure 1\n\nPersonal transfers in billions of USD \n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n2011\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\nAustria\n\nBelgium\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nItaly\n\nNetherlands\n\nSpain\n\nSweden\n\nNote: At current prices.\n\nSource: World Bank (World Development Indicators).\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nRemittances sent abroad declined across Europe in 2015 and 2016, but have since been steadily increasing again. \n\n304\n\nDIW Weekly Report 49/2024\n\nREMITTANCES\n\ndistinguish specifically between migrants without a refu­\n\ngee background, refugees, and non-migrants in regard to \n\nremittances.9 It is based on data from the Socio-Economic \n\nPanel (SOEP),10 the IAB-SOEP Migration Samples from \n\n2013 to 2022, and the IAB-BAMF-SOEP Survey of Refugees \n\n9\t The authors would like to thank Leon Prag and Jan Kacprzak for their research assistance.\n\n10\t The SOEP is an annual representative and multidisciplinary survey of private households that \n\nhas been running since 1984.

Transfers \n\nof smaller amounts (under 12,500 euros) and informal remittances \n\nare frequently not included, which can result in the actual remit­\n\ntance volume being underestimated. In addition, the data can \n\ninclude remittances made by Germans without a migration back­\n\nground. Furthermore, there are challenges in recording informal \n\nand digital remittances.\n\nSOEP data and methodology\n\nThe German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) data used in this \n\nWeekly Report can provide some of this more detailed informa­\n\ntion for Germany. SOEP is a representative and multidisciplinary \n\nhousehold survey encompassing around 15,00 households \n\n(Version 39) that has been conducted every year since 1984. The \n\nanalysis is limited to the years 2013 to 2022 to explicitly record the \n\nsurvey waves of the IAB-SOEP Migration Samples as well as the \n\nIAB-BAMF-SOEP Refugee Survey.3 Including these studies creates \n\na representative population sample of people with migration and \n\nrefugee backgrounds, which reflects the migration dynamics of the \n\n1\t\n\nAndrea Friedrich, Jens Walter, and Birgit Zeitschel, The German remittance market – an over­\n\nview (Deutsche Bundesbank: 2007) (in German; available online).\n\n2\t International Monetary Fund, Balance of Payments and International Investment Position \n\n­Manual. Sixth Edition (BPM6) (2009) (available online).\n\n3\t IAB-SOEP Migration Samples (M1, M2, M7, M8 or M8b), data from 2013–2022 (in German; \n\navailable online); IAB-BAMF-SOEP Refugee Survey (M3-M6), data from 2016–2022 (in German; \n\navailable online).\n\npast decade and can be compared with the rest of the population \n\nincluded in the SOEP.4\n\nQuestions used for the analysis on remittances abroad are located \n\nin the Family and Friends (Familie und Freundeskreis) section \n\nof the survey (see for example question 218 in the individual \n\nquestionnaire (Fragebogen Personen, SOEP v39). The following \n\nquestion is asked in all samples: “Did you send money or other \n\nfinancial support to relatives or other people outside of your house­\n\nhold in the last year (20xx)? If yes, what was the total amount you \n\ntransferred in 20xx? Where does the recipient live?” The possible \n\nanswer categories for recipient are: Parents, children, spouse/ex-\n\nspouse, other relatives, unrelated people, or no transfers sent.\n\nMultiple answers are possible. This way, respondents can indicate \n\nthat they sent transfers to relatives abroad as well as to relatives \n\nliving in Germany. This makes it possible to record the remittance \n\npractices of respondents comprehensively while considering the \n\ndifferent locations of the recipients.\n\nA distinction is made between personal transfers made exclusively \n\nwithin Germany and personal transfers abroad for the analysis in \n\nthis Weekly Report. However, the survey does not provide more \n\nexact information on what specific countries the remittances are \n\nbeing sent to. Based on this definition, this Weekly Report focuses \n\non people who have sent remittances abroad to one or more of the \n\nrecipients mentioned.\n\nAs is well known in research, remittance amounts reported by \n\nrespondents are often incomplete and subject to underreporting \n\nand inaccuracies.5 A detailed analysis of these values requires a \n\ncomplex method of multiple imputation, which is beyond the scope \n\nof this Weekly Report. Therefore, the present analysis focuses on \n\nif a person has sent a remittance abroad or not, without taking full \n\naccount of how much was sent.\n\n4\t cf.

In essence, \n\nthere are three main motives for sending remittances: altru­\n\nism, strategic or investment reasons, and social and cul­\n\ntural bonds.12 These motivations can overlap and reflect dif­\n\nferent needs and circumstances, which can vary depend­\n\ning on the migrants’ individual situation and the nature of \n\ntheir migration.\n\nAltruistic motives\n\nA key motive for sending remittances is altruism, the desire \n\nto support relatives in need. This motive drives more remit­\n\ntances during crisis periods in migrants’ home countries in \n\nparticular, when families are faced with economic challenges, \n\npolitical instability, or natural disasters. In such cases, remit­\n\ntances are vital aid to secure basic needs such as food, medi­\n\ncal care, and education.13 This form of assistance is common \n\namong both migrants without a refugee background as well \n\nas refugees, although the latter may be under particular pres­\n\nsure to provide financial support due to their refugee situ­\n\nation and the often precarious situation of their families.14\n\nStrategic or investment motives\n\nRemittances are strategic investments for some migrants, \n\nespecially those who are economically stable. Remittances \n\nare used to acquire or maintain assets in their home coun­\n\ntry, such as real estate or family businesses. Generally, the \n\ngoal is to secure long-term sources of income or to ensure \n\na possible return.15 This is generally a motive for migrants \n\nwithout a refugee background, who, unlike refugees, tend to \n\nhave a secure work situation and thus can use their financial \n\nresources to plan for long-term investments in their home \n\ncountry.16 Favorable investment conditions, such as changes \n\nin exchange rates or low interest rates or transaction costs, \n\ncan also stimulate this type of personal transfer.\n\nSocial and cultural bonds\n\nIn addition to economic motives, remittances are also sent \n\nto maintain a connection to one’s home country or to live \n\nup to familial or cultural expectations. For many migrants, \n\nregularly sending remittances strengthens not only familial \n\n12\t Frédéric Docquier, Hillel Rapoport, and Sara Salomone, “Remittances, migrants' education \n\nand immigration policy: Theory and evidence from bilateral data,” Regional Science and Urban \n\n­Economics 42, no. 5 (2012): 817–828.\n\n13\t Cynthia Bansak and Brian Chezum, “How Do Remittances Affect Human Capital Formation of \n\nSchool-Age Boys and Girls?” American Economic Review 99, no. 2 (2009): 145–148 (available online. \n\nAccessed on November 22, 2024).\n\n14\t Robert E.

Nevertheless, refugees often find themselves in a \n\ndilemma: Although they have strong familial ties, financial \n\nlimitations in their host country can limit the amount and \n\nregularity of remittances.\n\nMigrants send remittances abroad more often \n\nthan refugees\n\nTo understand the theoretical motives for remitting in practice, \n\nwe first describe the development of the share of people who \n\nsend personal transfers abroad using SOEP data from 2013 \n\nto 2022. Next, statistical models shed light on the characteris­\n\ntics that are associated with a higher likelihood of remitting.\n\nAlthough remittances abroad are mainly associated with \n\nmigrants, non-migrants (Germans without a migration \n\nbackground) also send personal transfers to other coun­\n\ntries. In recent years, between three and four percent of all \n\npeople living in Germany sent remittances abroad (Figure 2), \n\nas well as around 1.5 percent of non-migrants. However, \n\nSOEP data only provide limited information on the amounts \n\nnon-migrants send abroad or for what specific reasons they \n\nare remitting. It is unclear whether they send remittances \n\n17\t Anna Lindley, “The early-morning phonecall: Remittances from a refugee diaspora perspec­\n\ntive,” Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies 35, no. 8 (2009) (available online).\n\nFigure 2\n\nPeople in Germany who send remittances abroad \n\nShare in percent of all people living in Germany\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n4.5\n\n2012\n\n2013\n\n2014\n\n2015\n\n2016\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\nNote: The vertical lines indicate the 95 percent confidence interval.

These results correlate \n\nwith the strategic and investment motives described in the \n\nliterature, which are often accompanied by altruistic motives.\n\nThe decline of remittances sent by migrants without a \n\n­refugee background between 2013 and 2016 coincides with \n\nthe increase in asylum seekers in Europe in 2015 and 2016, \n\nwhen around 1.3 million refugees, mainly from Syria, came \n\nto Germany.18 The German population’s increased altruistic \n\ncommitment to refugees during this period could explain \n\nwhy fewer migrants sent remittances abroad.19\n\nThe share of refugees who send remittances abroad is lower \n\nthan the share of migrants without a refugee background who \n\nremit abroad. From 2013 to 2016, there was a steady decrease \n\nfrom 15 to seven percent (Figure 4). The share of refugees \n\nsending remittances abroad declined in 2015 and 2016 in par­\n\nticular, similar as to other migrants. Between 2017 and 2020 \n\nthe share stabilized at around ten percent before falling down \n\nto seven percent in 2021. Presumably, this upward trend can \n\nbe explained by economic and job-related difficulties, which \n\nmany people faced during the coronavirus pandemic.20 The \n\ntrend suggests that while refugees want to maintain strong \n\nsocial bonds and cultural ties to their home countries and \n\nsupport their families, their economic situation limits their \n\nability to remit regularly.\n\nMen, small households, and divorcees send \n\nremittances abroad more frequently\n\nTo understand why people send remittances abroad, the \n\nfollowing section utilizes two statistical models to investi­\n\ngate the personal and familial factors that can influence the \n\nlikelihood of remitting. In the first model, variables such \n\nas gender, level of education, household size, number of \n\nchildren, marital status, and life satisfaction are considered \n\n(Figure 5). The models differentiate between non-migrants \n\n(Germans without a migration background) and migrants \n\n(migrants without a refugee background and refugees). The \n\nresults show that migrants are 2.1 percentage points more \n\nlikely to send remittances abroad than non-migrants, while \n\nrefugees are 2.7 percentage points less likely to send remit­\n\ntances than non-migrants. This is in line with studies that \n\nshow that refugees are often subject to greater economic \n\nrestrictions, which limits their ability to send remittances.21\n\n18\t Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung, Demografie von Asylsuchenden in Deutschland (2024) \n\n(in German; available online).\n\n19\t Chang Woon Nam and Peter Steinhoff, “The Role of Volunteers in German Refugee Crisis and \n\nTheir Contribution to the Local Government Expenditure,” CESifo Working Paper No. 73 (2018) \n\n(available online).\n\n20\t Herbert Brücker et al., “Die Arbeitsmarktwirkungen der COVID-19-Pandemie auf Geflüchtete \n\nund andere Migrantinnen und Migranten,” IAB-Forschungsbericht, no. 5 (2021) (in German; \n\navailable online).\n\n21\t Francesco Fasani et al., “The Struggle for Refugee integration into the labor market: evidence \n\nfrom Europe,” Journal of Economic Geography 22, no. 2 (2022): 351–393 (available online).\n\nsporadically, such as to support relatives in specific situations, \n\nas opposed to regularly like many migrants.

Studies \n\non gender-specific remittance practices suggest that women \n\nmigrants often face major economic barriers and have spe­\n\ncific ­familial obligations that limit their ability to earn an \n\nincome and thus to remit.22 Income differences in particular \n\nexplain why women, even if they want to support their fami­\n\nlies abroad, send less frequently as well as smaller amounts \n\nthan men.23\n\nLevel of education only shows a small influence on remit­\n\ntance behavior, which is consistent with the mixed evidence \n\nin the research. Some studies suggest that better educated \n\nmigrants remit less frequently, as they had already been liv­\n\ning in more stable economic situations due to their qualifica­\n\ntions in their home countries before they left, and they expe­\n\nrience less pressure to support their family.24 Their families \n\nare possibly more financially secure and less dependent on \n\nregular remittances. Other studies suggest that less educated \n\nmigrants remit more frequently, especially if their families \n\nare experiencing economic difficulties or they migrated to \n\nGermany primarily to financially provide for their family.25\n\nHousehold size also influences remittance behavior: With \n\nevery additional household member, the likelihood of a remit­\n\ntance declines by 0.4 percentage points, which indicates more \n\nfinancial obligations within a larger household. Marital status \n\nis also an influential factor: Widows and widowers, divorcees, \n\nand people who are separated are more likely to send remit­\n\ntances than married people. This is likely due to a strong feel­\n\ning of responsibility for relatives living abroad or being geo­\n\ngraphically separated from family members. These results \n\nare consistent with the research that emphasizes the sig­\n\nnificance of the family structure for remittance behavior.26\n\nIntention to return to home country \n\ninfluences remittances\n\nThe second model differentiates between migrants without a \n\nrefugee background and refugees. Additional factors, such as \n\nthe intention to stay in Germany permanently and a strong \n\nbond to the home country, are investigated (Figure 6). It can \n\nbe seen that migrants who plan to live in Germany perma­\n\nnently send remittances abroad less often. This indicates \n\nthat a long-term intention to stay in Germany is associated \n\nwith a greater prioritization of investments in Germany.27 In \n\n22\t Elke Holst, Andrea Schäfer, and Mechthild Schrooten, “Gender, Transnational Networks and \n\nRemittances: Evidence from Germany,” DIW Discussion Paper no. 1005 (2010) (available online).\n\n23\t Rahel Kunz and Julia Maisenbacher, “Gender and remittances,” in The Palgrave Handbook of \n\nGender and Migration (2021), 321–338 (available online).\n\n24\t Docquier, Rapoport, and Salomone, “Remittances, migrants' education and immigration ­policy.”\n\n25\t Richard H.

On the one hand, this find­\n\ning exposes the contradictory nature of the political debate, \n\nwhich focuses on remittances sent by refugees and resulted \n\nin the introduction of the payment card system in various fed­\n\neral states, among other things, without empirical evidence \n\nof its benefits. Secondly, this finding emphasizes the need \n\nfor a more in-depth analysis to shed light on the connections \n\nbetween remittances and the specific, diverse living condi­\n\ntions of migrants (such as their different employment situ­\n\nations). For such an analysis, data collection on remittances \n\nmust also be improved, as central banks in particular often \n\nfail to adequately record informal financial flows. Advanced \n\ntechniques, such integrating different data sources and mul­\n\ntiple imputation, could provide more accurate figures and \n\nthus create a reliable basis for economic policy decisions.\n\nFurthermore, it is crucial to recognize the value of remit­\n\ntances as an informal but important form of economic sup­\n\nport.29 Remittances abroad, which are often sent for personal \n\nreasons, contribute significantly to the economic stability \n\nof families in low and middle-income countries according \n\nto studies. Remittances are often more effective than finan­\n\ncial resources from development cooperation, as they reach \n\nthose in need directly without losing money due to bureau­\n\ncracy or corruption. In this way, remittances make an impor­\n\ntant contribution to reducing poverty and economic resil­\n\nience.30 Migrants’ remittances abroad can be considered a \n\ndriving force in promoting the United Nations Sustainable \n\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs), as they improve the living con­\n\nditions of families and communities. Remittances make it \n\npossible for migrants to support their families back home, \n\nan action in line with the SDG framework,31 which empha­\n\nsizes the right of every person to freely spend their income, \n\nregardless of where their relatives live.\n\nReevaluating the role of remittances could help better focus \n\npolicy measures on supporting remittances and their func­\n\ntion as a direct development instrument.32 Targeted support \n\nof the economic integration of refugees would be a deci­\n\nsive step in strengthening their financial independence and \n\nimproving their ability to support their families abroad. This \n\nwould strengthen their economic resilience as well as the \n\npositive effect of the remittances to their home countries.\n\n29\t In accordance with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, Germany has commit­\n\nted to providing 0.7 percent of its GDP for formal development aid each year. In 2022, the target was \n\neven slightly exceeded, as 0.85 percent of GDP was provided. It should be noted that all government \n\nspending on refugees during their first year of residence is also included in the calculation, cf. infor­\n\nmation on the website of the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (Bundes­\n\nministerium für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung, BMZ) (in German; available online).\n\n30\t Richard H.

This Weekly Repor investigates how he \n\nshare of people living in Germany who send remi ances \n\nabroad has changed over ime according o heir migration \n\nbackground (with or withou a refugee background) and \n\nwhich factors influence he likelihood of remi ing. Based on \n\nSocio-Economic Panel (SOEP) data as well as he IAB-SOEP \n\nMigration Samples and he IAB-BAMF-SOEP Refugee Survey \n\nfrom 2013 o 2022, he analysis shows ha migrants withou \n\na refugee background send remi ances more often, while \n\nrefugees are often rarely able o send remi ances due o \n\nstructural barriers. Thus, he political debate does no reflec \n\nreality. A person’s family situation and heir intention o stay in \n\nGermany long erm are particularly importan factors influenc­\n\ning he likelihood ha hey will send remi ances abroad. In \n\nthis respect, hese results should contribute o a reevaluation \n\nof remi ances, as hey are an importan instrumen in achiev­\n\ning sustainable developmen goals, in stabilizing he economy \n\nin he migrants’ home countries, and reducing poverty.\n\nIn recen decades, he volume of he global flow of remit­\n\ntances sen by migrants has grown significantly and reached \n\nhistoric peaks. According o World Bank data based on cal­\n\nculations by central banks around he world, hese remit­\n\ntance flows have developed into a significan income source \n\nfor many low and middle-income countries. These personal \n\ntransfers, referred o hereafter interchangeably as “personal \n\ntransfers” or “remi ances,” help millions of families mee \n\ntheir basic needs and make an importan contribution o local \n\neconomic development.1 Germany is also par of his global \n\ntrend: Since he 2000s, he country has recorded a continu­\n\ning increase of remi ances sen abroad (Figure 1). By 2023, \n\nGermany was one of he op European nations in remit­\n\ntances sent, reaching over 24 billion dollars (22 billion euros).\n\nThis developmen reflects he change in migration ­dynamics \n\ntha Germany has experienced over he pas wo decades. \n\nSince 2000, he share of he population with a migration \n\nbackground2 has risen steadily. As of 2022, i was around \n\n25 percen of he population, or around 21 million people. \n\nThis increase is due both o he arrival of skilled migrants as \n\nwell as of asylum seekers from crisis regions such as Syria, \n\nAfghanistan, and Ukraine. As of 2023, a new record of around \n\n3.2 million asylum seekers are living in Germany.3 This situ­\n\nation reflects Germany’s humanitarian commitment, bu has \n\nalso led o more debate on migration policy. Critical voices \n\ndemand stricter regulations, especially regarding accepting \n\nasylum seekers. One key argumen in his discussion is he \n\n1\t\n\nDilip Ratha et al., Remi ances Slowed in 2023, Expected o Grow Faster in 2024 (Washington, \n\nDC: World Bank, 2024) (available online.

This applies o all other \n\nonline sources in his repor unless stated otherwise).\n\n2\t This Weekly Repor does no differentiate between direc (born abroad) and indirec migration \n\n(a leas one paren born abroad) backgrounds. Instead, both groups are considered migrants. We \n\nonly differentiate between non-migrants and migrants (with and withou a refugee background). \n\nThe definition of migrants and heir offspring is based on differen characteristics ha are avail­\n\nable in he SOEP dataset, such as country of birth, country of origin, year of migration, and oth­\n\ner information abou heir migration, cf.

This presumption has already led o concrete \n\nregulatory measures: For example, a paymen card system \n\nhas been introduced, which limits asylum seekers’ access o \n\ndisposable cash.4 The goal of his measure is o control he \n\nuse of state subsidies more strictly and o ensure ha refu­\n\ngees are mainly using his money o suppor hemselves in \n\nGermany.5 However, his debate ignores he positive effects \n\ntha remi ances sen abroad have on he recipien countries.6\n\nThe increase in remi ances and he related policy reactions \n\nemphasize he opic’s complexity: They illustrate how closely \n\nrelated economic aspects of migration and social policy chal­\n\nlenges and public discourse are.

This results in a certain unclarity, as he actual \n\nremi ance amounts of he individual groups canno be deter­\n\nmined. Moreover, remi ances sen via informal channels are \n\noften no included or are underestimated, which further dis­\n\ntorts he overall figures.8\n\nFor a clearer understanding of who is sending remi ances \n\nunder wha conditions, we mus analyze he rends in remit­\n\ntances and he driving factors behind hem more closely. \n\nSuch an analysis provides no only a look a he economic \n\nrelationships and realities of migrants in Germany, bu also \n\nreveals wha motives and challenges are driving hem o send \n\nfinancial suppor o heir home countries.

In essence, \n\nthere are hree main motives for sending remi ances: altru­\n\nism, strategic or investmen reasons, and social and cul­\n\ntural bonds.12 These motivations can overlap and reflec dif­\n\nferen needs and circumstances, which can vary depend­\n\ning on he migrants’ individual situation and he nature of \n\ntheir migration.\n\nAltruistic motives\n\nA key motive for sending remi ances is altruism, he desire \n\nto suppor relatives in need. This motive drives more remit­\n\ntances during crisis periods in migrants’ home countries in \n\nparticular, when families are faced with economic challenges, \n\npolitical instability, or natural disasters. In such cases, remit­\n\ntances are vital aid o secure basic needs such as food, medi­\n\ncal care, and education.13 This form of assistance is common \n\namong both migrants withou a refugee background as well \n\nas refugees, although he la er may be under particular pres­\n\nsure o provide financial suppor due o heir refugee situ­\n\nation and he often precarious situation of heir families.14\n\nStrategic or investmen motives\n\nRemi ances are strategic investments for some migrants, \n\nespecially hose who are economically stable. Remi ances \n\nare used o acquire or maintain assets in heir home coun­\n\ntry, such as real estate or family businesses. Generally, he \n\ngoal is o secure long-term sources of income or o ensure \n\na possible return.15 This is generally a motive for migrants \n\nwithou a refugee background, who, unlike refugees, end o \n\nhave a secure work situation and hus can use heir financial \n\nresources o plan for long-term investments in heir home \n\ncountry.16 Favorable investmen conditions, such as changes \n\nin exchange rates or low interes rates or ransaction costs, \n\ncan also stimulate his ype of personal ransfer.\n\nSocial and cultural bonds\n\nIn addition o economic motives, remi ances are also sen \n\nto maintain a connection o one’s home country or o live \n\nup o familial or cultural expectations. For many migrants, \n\nregularly sending remi ances strengthens no only familial \n\n12\t Frédéric Docquier, Hillel Rapoport, and Sara Salomone, “Remi ances, migrants' education \n\nand immigration policy: Theory and evidence from bilateral data,” Regional Science and Urban \n\n­Economics 42, no. 5 (2012): 817–828.\n\n13\t Cynthia Bansak and Brian Chezum, “How Do Remi ances Affec Human Capital Formation of \n\nSchool-Age Boys and Girls?” American Economic Review 99, no. 2 (2009): 145–148 (available online. \n\nAccessed on November 22, 2024).\n\n14\t Rober E.

In recen years, between hree and four percen of all \n\npeople living in Germany sen remi ances abroad (Figure 2), \n\nas well as around 1.5 percen of non-migrants.

These results correlate \n\nwith he strategic and investmen motives described in he \n\nliterature, which are often accompanied by altruistic motives.\n\nThe decline of remi ances sen by migrants withou a \n\n­refugee background between 2013 and 2016 coincides with \n\nthe increase in asylum seekers in Europe in 2015 and 2016, \n\nwhen around 1.3 million refugees, mainly from Syria, came \n\nto Germany.18 The German population’s increased altruistic \n\ncommitmen o refugees during his period could explain \n\nwhy fewer migrants sen remi ances abroad.19\n\nThe share of refugees who send remi ances abroad is lower \n\nthan he share of migrants withou a refugee background who \n\nremi abroad. From 2013 o 2016, here was a steady decrease \n\nfrom 15 o seven percen (Figure 4). The share of refugees \n\nsending remi ances abroad declined in 2015 and 2016 in par­\n\nticular, similar as o other migrants. Between 2017 and 2020 \n\nthe share stabilized a around en percen before falling down \n\nto seven percen in 2021. Presumably, his upward rend can \n\nbe explained by economic and job-related difficulties, which \n\nmany people faced during he coronavirus pandemic.20 The \n\ntrend suggests ha while refugees wan o maintain strong \n\nsocial bonds and cultural ies o heir home countries and \n\nsuppor heir families, heir economic situation limits heir \n\nability o remi regularly.\n\nMen, small households, and divorcees send \n\nremi ances abroad more frequently\n\nTo understand why people send remi ances abroad, he \n\nfollowing section utilizes wo statistical models o investi­\n\ngate he personal and familial factors ha can influence he \n\nlikelihood of remi ing. In he firs model, variables such \n\nas gender, level of education, household size, number of \n\nchildren, marital status, and life satisfaction are considered \n\n(Figure 5). The models differentiate between non-migrants \n\n(Germans withou a migration background) and migrants \n\n(migrants withou a refugee background and refugees).

Studies \n\non gender-specific remi ance practices sugges ha women \n\nmigrants often face major economic barriers and have spe­\n\ncific ­familial obligations ha limi heir ability o earn an \n\nincome and hus o remit.22 Income differences in particular \n\nexplain why women, even if hey wan o suppor heir fami­\n\nlies abroad, send less frequently as well as smaller amounts \n\nthan men.23\n\nLevel of education only shows a small influence on remit­\n\ntance behavior, which is consisten with he mixed evidence \n\nin he research. Some studies sugges ha be er educated \n\nmigrants remi less frequently, as hey had already been liv­\n\ning in more stable economic situations due o heir qualifica­\n\ntions in heir home countries before hey left, and hey expe­\n\nrience less pressure o suppor heir family.24 Their families \n\nare possibly more financially secure and less dependen on \n\nregular remi ances. Other studies sugges ha less educated \n\nmigrants remi more frequently, especially if heir families \n\nare experiencing economic difficulties or hey migrated o \n\nGermany primarily o financially provide for heir family.25\n\nHousehold size also influences remi ance behavior: With \n\nevery additional household member, he likelihood of a remit­\n\ntance declines by 0.4 percentage points, which indicates more \n\nfinancial obligations within a larger household. Marital status \n\nis also an influential factor: Widows and widowers, divorcees, \n\nand people who are separated are more likely o send remit­\n\ntances han married people. This is likely due o a strong feel­\n\ning of responsibility for relatives living abroad or being geo­\n\ngraphically separated from family members. These results \n\nare consisten with he research ha emphasizes he sig­\n\nnificance of he family structure for remi ance behavior.26\n\nIntention o return o home country \n\ninfluences remi ances\n\nThe second model differentiates between migrants withou a \n\nrefugee background and refugees. Additional factors, such as \n\nthe intention o stay in Germany permanently and a strong \n\nbond o he home country, are investigated (Figure 6). I can \n\nbe seen ha migrants who plan o live in Germany perma­\n\nnently send remi ances abroad less often. This indicates \n\ntha a long-term intention o stay in Germany is associated \n\nwith a greater prioritization of investments in Germany.27 In \n\n22\t Elke Holst, Andrea Schäfer, and Mechthild Schrooten, “Gender, Transnational Networks and \n\nRemi ances: Evidence from Germany,” DIW Discussion Paper no. 1005 (2010) (available online).\n\n23\t Rahel Kunz and Julia Maisenbacher, “Gender and remi ances,” in The Palgrave Handbook of \n\nGender and Migration (2021), 321–338 (available online).\n\n24\t Docquier, Rapoport, and Salomone, “Remi ances, migrants' education and immigration ­policy.”\n\n25\t Richard H.

Secondly, his finding emphasizes he need \n\nfor a more in-depth analysis o shed ligh on he connections \n\nbetween remi ances and he specific, diverse living condi­\n\ntions of migrants (such as heir differen employmen situ­\n\nations). For such an analysis, data collection on remi ances \n\nmus also be improved, as central banks in particular often \n\nfail o adequately record informal financial flows. Advanced \n\ntechniques, such integrating differen data sources and mul­\n\ntiple imputation, could provide more accurate figures and \n\nthus create a reliable basis for economic policy decisions.\n\nFurthermore, i is crucial o recognize he value of remit­\n\ntances as an informal bu importan form of economic sup­\n\nport.29 Remi ances abroad, which are often sen for personal \n\nreasons, contribute significantly o he economic stability \n\nof families in low and middle-income countries according \n\nto studies. Remi ances are often more effective han finan­\n\ncial resources from developmen cooperation, as hey reach \n\nthose in need directly withou losing money due o bureau­\n\ncracy or corruption. In his way, remi ances make an impor­\n\ntan contribution o reducing poverty and economic resil­\n\nience.30 Migrants’ remi ances abroad can be considered a \n\ndriving force in promoting he United Nations Sustainable \n\nDevelopmen Goals (SDGs), as hey improve he living con­\n\nditions of families and communities. Remi ances make i \n\npossible for migrants o suppor heir families back home, \n\nan action in line with he SDG framework,31 which empha­\n\nsizes he righ of every person o freely spend heir income, \n\nregardless of where heir relatives live.\n\nReevaluating he role of remi ances could help be er focus \n\npolicy measures on supporting remi ances and heir func­\n\ntion as a direc developmen instrument.32 Targeted suppor \n\nof he economic integration of refugees would be a deci­\n\nsive step in strengthening heir financial independence and \n\nimproving heir ability o suppor heir families abroad. This \n\nwould strengthen heir economic resilience as well as he \n\npositive effec of he remi ances o heir home countries.\n\n29\t In accordance with he United Nations’ Sustainable Developmen Goals, Germany has commit­\n\nted o providing 0.7 percen of its GDP for formal developmen aid each year. In 2022, he arge was \n\neven slightly exceeded, as 0.85 percen of GDP was provided.
