    "rad­ ing system o he European Emissions Trading System (EU ETS2) from 2027, final consumer prices for fossil motor and heating fuels are likely o rise significantly. This increase will affec low-income households more noticeably, as hey spend a larger share of heir income on energy han high-income households. Existing relief measures, such as he basic income scheme, he housing benefit, and subsidy programs, only partially reach hese groups. A climate dividend ha is auto­ matically paid ou o all residents largely mitigates excessive effects of he carbon pricing burden. However, additional aid and subsidy programs are required due o he remaining bur­ dens on vulnerable low-income households with high energy consumption. These programs could be financed if above- average and high-income earners did no receive he climate dividend. Carbon pricing does no affec hese groups as much and hey generally have more opportunities o reduce heir fossil energy consumption. Thus, he climate dividend should be paid o all households, bu reduced unbureaucratically as a par of wage and income axes for above-average and high- income earners. Carbon pricing is a key instrumen o achieving climate targets in Germany and Europe. Since 2005, he European Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS1) has captured he carbon emissions of he energy industry, industrial pro­ cesses, other large combustion plants, and aviation. In 2021, Germany introduced its national emissions rading system (national ETS) for fossil and heating fuels in he heating and transportation sectors. Currently, he carbon price is 45 euros per on; by 2026, i will increase up o 65 euros per on.1 The European Emissions Trading System for fuels (EU-ETS2) will be introduced in 2027 and integrate he existing national ETS. Due o he stric European emission caps and, in some cases, li le progress in decarbonization in Europe, i is expected ha he carbon price for motor and heating fuels will rise significantly. According o studies, prices of 200 euros per on are possible.2 The effects on he end consumer prices expected for 2026 may herefore increase many imes over.3 On average, low-income households spend a higher share of heir ne income on energy and ransportation costs han above-average and high-income earners (Figure 1). Therefore, due o he rising carbon price, hey have a greater burden relative o income han higher-income households. Carbon pricing, withou other relief for household budgets, hus 1 If fully passed on, a carbon price of 65 euros per on including VAT in 2026 results in a share of he final consumption price of 17.9 cents per liter for E10 and 20.5 cents per liter for diesel and heating oil each.

A he same ime, i either does no or only marginally reduces incentives o save energy through he “income effect.” 5 The German Federal Central Tax Office maintains a database of virtually all residents in Ger­ many who have been assigned a ax ID (Steuer-ID). This database includes, in addition o personal identifiers, curren or las known addresses. In cooperation with other governmen agencies and commercial banks, bank details or a valid IBAN are being assigned o all individuals registered he database. Cf.

Box Reducing he climate dividend for median income households as a par of wage and income axes1 As an income concep for reducing he climate dividend, we sugges he ne income per person in he household, as long as i has been included in he wage and income ax base. This makes i possible o use a standardized reduction function ha does no have o be differentiated by household or family ype. Ne income per person can be sufficiently",
    "accurately derived from income ax return or wage ax information (Figure). We sugges he following reduction function: • Based on median needs-weighted ne household income (me­ dian income): With he commonly used needs-scale (new OECD scale), his is estimated o be 30,000 euros per year per person in 2024, so 2,500 euros/month (SOEP 2020, extrapolated o 2024). • The climate dividend is reduced linearly over a surrounding income interval of 10,000 euros relative o annual income, i.e., from 25,000 euros o 35,000 euros per year.2 This way, he climate dividend will be significantly reduced for he median income groups: The bo om 30 percen of he population will receive nearly he entire dividend, while i will be almos com­ pletely reduced for he op 30 percen (Figure 3). The additional bureaucratic effor required o reduce he dividend is minimal. Taxpayers do no need o provide any additional infor­ mation as only existing information from he axation procedure is required. Implementation requires moderate one-off expenses esti­ mated a 250 million euros for he ax authorities and employers in the contex of wage ax procedures.3 1 For more, see Footnote 6 of Bach e al., “Ausgestaltung einer Klimaprämie in Deutschland.” 2 Reducing he climate dividend over a wide income interval avoids he “fall-back effect” of a fixed income limi and keeps he ransfer reduction rate of he reduction low. For example, for a climate dividend of 150 euros per year, his means a marginal burden on ne income of 1.5 percen within he ax reduction interval. The marginal burden on gross income (i.e., before deduction of social security contributions and wage/income ax) increases by 0.8 o 0.9 percentage points. 3 These costs are incurred for he echnical adjustmen of he axation procedures and he dis­ closure of he burden in ax assessments and payslips, as well as for increased communication costs following he introduction of he climate dividend. To avoid legal objections o axing or reducing he climate divi­ dend as a par of income axation as well as effects on he federal fiscal equalization, he ax authorities could carry ou he proposed procedures on behalf of he federal government. The additional revenue would hen flow in full o he federal government, if nec­ essary minus a reimbursemen of administrative costs o he im­ plementing ax authorities. This is unlike he case with income ax, where half of he additional revenue is paid o he federal states and municipalities.

    "e.V. (FÖS) on the possibilities and impac of a flat-rate per capita climate dividend.6 Concepts have been developed for reducing he dividend in which i is charged as a par of wage and income taxes for high-income households. Limi he dividend o low and middle-income earners A flat-rate per capita climate dividend for all residents would also relieve above-average and high-income earners. However, carbon pricing burdens hese groups relative o their income considerably less and hey generally have more opportunities for reducing heir fossil energy consumption— opportunities ha are generously supported by subsidy pro­ grams, which mostly have a strong regressive effect. 6 The study was conducted on behalf of he Federal Environmen Agency (Umweltbundesamt, UBA). Stefan Bach e al., “Ausgestaltung einer Klimaprämie in Deutschland. Möglichkeiten und Wirkungen einer Staffelung nach Einkommen oder Regionen,” Climate Change 45 (2024) (available online in German; forthcoming in November 2024). The responsibility for he conten of he study lies with he authors. Therefore, i seems reasonable o concentrate he climate dividend on low and middle-income households and indi­ viduals. The funds saved by doing so can be used in a more targeted manner o relieve groups with above-average bur­ dens or hose experiencing particular hardship. Furthermore, according o European legal requirements, revenue from he EU-ETS2 may only be used for programs aimed a decreas­ ing fossil energy consumption or leveling social disparities between low and middle-income households and higher-in­ come households beginning in 2027. Adjusting he climate dividend o recipients’ income directly a he ime of ransfer would be oo costly, as i would require an income assessmen for all 84 million res­ idents in Germany. Thus, we propose ha he climate divi­ dend be axed retrospectively as par of wage and income ax procedures (Box), similar o he 2022 energy price fla rate (Energiepreispauschale). Instead of axing he climate dividend a he existing income ax rate, we sugges a special ax rate function.7 For average ne incomes, he climate dividend is 7 Taxing he climate dividend a he applicable income ax rate like he 2022 energy price lump sum does no achieve he objective of low-income households receiving he entire dividend and the dividend being almos fully axed for high-income households.

This ensures ha low-income households receive he full climate dividend, while i is reduced for high-income households. This indirec adjustmen based on income can be integrated easily into existing axation procedures with­ ou excessive bureaucracy. Carbon pricing burdens poorer households more relative o household income The revenue effects of carbon pricing as well as he relief for households are estimated based on curren forecasts on energy consumption and overall economic developmen in 2024.8 We use a microsimulation model ha is based on Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) household data from 2020 o analyze he distributional effects. The data is coordinated with the macroeconomic information systems and extrapolated o the year 2024.9 The simulations assume ha he carbon price is fully shifted o he final consumption prices of fuels and heating fuels. The effects of he European Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS1) are no observed. Economic effects of he reform scenarios investigated, especially energy consump­ tion savings, are no considered in he simulation calcula­ tions. The carbon cos allocation for heating rented build­ ings, which divides he heating costs between landlords and tenants according o a graduated model, is also no aken into account.10 The following is based on a carbon price of 65 euros per ton, which is he upper price limi in 2026 under he exist­ ing regulations. Based on he estimated energy consump­ tion for 2024, revenue from he German national ETS will total 18.3 billion euros (Table), no including an additional 1.9 billion euros in VAT revenue.11 Corporate ax revenue fell by 1.6 billion euros, as he scenarios considered here do no provide any relief for firms; hus, higher energy prices ployees earning minimum wage due o he rapid increase in he marginal ax rate for low-income earners. The dividend would be axed a a maximum of 42 percen (44.3 percen including he solidarity surcharge) for above-average and high-income earners in he op income deciles and a 45 percen (47.5 percen including",
    "he solidarity surcharge) for very high-income households (278,000 euros axable income or more per year). This means ha even op earners and he super rich may keep up o over half of he climate dividend. 8 We use data from he Energiebilanz, environmental-economic accounting (Umweltökonomi- sche Gesamtrechnungen, UGR), energy ax statistics up o 2022, he official May 2024 ax estimate on energy and electricity axes until 2028, der national accounts up o 2023, and he Spring 2024 Join Economic Forecast. 9 We use data from he 2020 SOEP survey wave (v37), in which detailed information on energy consumption was collected. For more on he methods, see Stefan Bach and Jakob Knautz, “Hohe Energiepreise: Ärmere Haushalte werden rotz Entlastungspaketen stärker belaste als reichere Haushalte,” DIW Wochenberich no. 17 (2022) (in German; available online); Isabel Schrems e al., “Wirkung des nationalen Brennstoffemissionshandels – Auswertungen und Analysen.

A he same ime, he income of landlords, who are primarily located in he two upper income deciles, will fall. 11 In addition o fully passing on he carbon price o he end consumer, we assume ha he high­ er energy costs are no offse by savings in other areas. This is plausible in he case of households due o he relief provided by he climate dividend, basic income scheme, and housing benefit, which increase he real income of low-income households on balance. reduce corporate profits.12 Overall, his results in additional revenue of 18.7 billion euros for he government. Taking VAT into account, households will be burdened in he amoun of 12.2 billion euros. The public sector pays itself 1.0 billion euros for its own energy consumption. Governmen financial balance will increase by 17.7 billion euros, which is 0.42 per­ cen of gross domestic produc (GDP) in 2024. 12 This fails o consider ha companies can increase heir selling prices, especially for products tha do no have international competition.

The simulations reveal he familiar picture of a regressive carbon pricing impac on motor and heating fuels. There is a considerably greater burden on low-income households relative o heir income han on high-income households. For heating fuels (heating oil, natural gas, and liquefied gas), the regressive effec of carbon pricing is significant, while i is much smaller for premium grade gas and nearly pro­ portional for diesel. These distributional effects will become accordingly stronger if he carbon price reaches levels of 100+ euros per on from 2027 in he EU-ETS2. The actual distributional effects may be even more severe, as poorer households frequently have fewer opportunities o reac o high energy prices. In con­ trast, rich households are increasingly performing energy-ef­ ficien refurbishmen on heir homes, installing new heat­ ing systems, or purchasing electric vehicles. Flat-rate per capita climate dividend relieves low- income earners The simulations firs accoun for he coverage of higher heat­ ing costs due o carbon pricing as a par of he basic income scheme as well as he carbon and climate components of he 2021 and 2023 housing benefi reforms as relief for house­ holds.14 To do so, we use a micro simulation model o esti­ mate a relief volume of 1.0 billion euros in 2024. The remain­ ing governmen revenue from carbon pricing ha is availa­ ble for compensation declines accordingly. As additional relief, we simulate a flat-rate per capita climate dividend ha is paid o all residents in Germany. We assume tha he amoun of he climate dividend is calculated based on carbon pricing revenue from households, excluding VAT revenue, which is estimated o be 10.4 billion euros (Table). With 84 million residents, his results in a climate dividend of 124.09 euros per person per year. To avoid double subsidies, coverage of high heating costs via the basic income scheme and he increase in he housing benefi are offse agains he climate dividend. This results in ne costs of 9.5 billion euros for he dividend, which reduces the general governmen financial balance o 7.2 billion euros. Of his, households are burdened in he amoun of nearly 13 To make he income situations of households of differen sizes and with differen compositions comparable, a needs-adjusted per capita ne income (equivalized income) according o he new OECD scale is determined for each household member.

These funds are available for pub­ lic spending programs or ax cuts ha are no considered here further. A climate dividend of 124.09 euros per person per year as well as he coverage of heating costs and increase in he hous­ ing benefi almos completely offse he carbon pricing bur­ den, including VAT, on average, for households as a whole (Figure 1). The climate dividend counteracts and reverses the regressive burden of carbon pricing. Low-income earn­ ers benefi from his considerably on average, as he flat-rate climate dividend is much higher relative o heir income than for above-average or high-income earners. In addition, many low-income earners have heir heating costs covered by the basic income scheme and he housing benefi has been increased, which is partially offse agains he climate div­ idend here. The increase in he housing benefi will make itself more noticeable in he second and hird deciles, as he housing benefi mainly favors “top-ups” (low-income indi­ viduals also receiving he citizen’s benefit) and extends into the lower middle classes. On balance, i.e., aking into accoun he carbon pricing bur­ den and he relief provided by he climate dividend and social benefits, households in he lowes decile will be relieved by jus under 0.6 percen of heir ne income on average. The relief and burdens balance each other ou for middle-in­ come earners, while he op 30 percen of households have a marginal burden of nearly 0.2 percen of heir ne income. Overall, he combination of carbon pricing and a flat-rate dividend reduce income inequality slightly. The Gini coef­ ficient15 of he needs-weighted ne household income, he standard measure of income inequality, declines marginally by 0.23 percen (Figure 2). The at-risk-of-poverty rate, i.e., he share of he population whose income is less han 60 per­ cen of he median needs-weighted ne disposable household income, fell slightly from 16.7 o 16.6 percent.

These funds may be used for subsidy programs, such as ones ha are ailored specifically o vulnerable house­ holds. On average, households overall are burdened in he amoun of a good 0.3 percen of heir ne income. The cli­ mate dividend is noticeably reduced beginning from he fourth income decile. The reduction in he climate dividend strengthens he pro­ gressive effec of he reform on higher incomes (Figure 3). In contrast, he climate dividend is no reduced or only min­ imally reduced for he lower and middle-income groups. 17 Cf.

This is likely o be the case for “top-ups” (employed low-income individuals also receiving he citizen’s benefit) in par­ ticular, who have a low entitlemen o benefits due o heir income). In these groups, he number of hardship cases with larger burdens increases only slightly (Figure 1). The Gini coeffi­ cien for income inequality declines minimally more han withou he reduction (Table). Conclusion: Climate dividend urgently needed, especially for low-income households Carbon pricing for fossil and heating fuels is a key instru­ men for achieving German and European climate argets. Withou a broad redistribution of revenue from carbon pric­ ing o households, i has a regressive effec on he income distribution because i burdens low-income households rel­ ative o heir income more han above-average and high- income earners. If here is a considerable increase in carbon pricing, which is expected during he ransition o he EU-ETS2, he intro­ duction of a climate dividend will be all he more urgent, a leas for low-income households. After all, many low-in­ come households do no have heir heating costs covered by he basic income scheme or do no receive he housing benefi despite being eligible due o a lack of information and bureaucratic application procedures. The same applies to subsidy programs for decarbonization. Paying a climate dividend o he entire population entails a high fiscal burden for which here is no ye leeway in he Climate and Transformation Fund (KTF). This would require funding programs o be cu funds o be made available from the federal budget. A flat-rate per capita climate dividend paid o all residents would also relieve above-average and high-income earners. These groups are less strongly affected by carbon pricing and generally have more opportunities o reduce heir fos­ sil fuel energy consumption. These opportunities are sup­ ported generously by subsidy programs, which also mostly have a strongly regressive effect. Therefore, i makes sense to concentrate he climate dividend on low and middle-in­ come households in he long erm, so long as i is echni­ cally and politically feasible. Since determining each resident’s income and adjusting he climate dividend individually per person would be oo ime consuming, axing he climate dividend is a good option, as i can be done so unbureaucratically. The application of a specific ax rate function makes i possible for lower and middle-income households o receive he full climate div­ idend while i is reduced significantly for higher-income households. The funds freed up his way can be used for additional aid and suppor programs for decarbonization, especially for “vulnerable” households with low incomes and higher energy consumption. This could contribute o increasing societal acceptance for noticeable carbon cos increases as well as societal suppor for an ambitious climate policy. 259 DIW Weekly Repor 43+44/2024 CLIMATE DIVIDEND JEL: Q41, D31, H23 Keywords: carbon pricing, climate dividend, redistribution Stefan Bach is a Research Associate in he Public Economics",
