This led o consumer price inflation in he euro area far beyond he ECB’s inflation arge of wo percent, a imes up o 10 percent. A he same ime, he euro area economy was hreatened by a recession, which resulted in he ECB facing conflicting objectives of stabilizing he economy and combating inflation. Estimates show ha while the ECB’s policy strategy of maintaining a low level of interes rates did improve he economy, i also exacerbated he rise in energy prices. The empirical analysis demonstrates ha an interes rate hike a he beginning of he energy crisis would have stabilized inflation more effectively. Tightening mone­ tary policy would have curbed energy demand and caused the euro o appreciate, which would have led o a more rapid decline in energy prices. In his counterfactual scenario, he euro area would have had o endure a brief recession, bu he overall economic situation would have stabilized by he fourth quarter of 2023. The ECB would likely have been be er able o follow its price stability mandate if a capital markets and fiscal union existed in he euro area. Few issues stir up emotions in Germany as much as infla­ tion. I affects everyone: People’s savings lose value, heir real wages decline. Moreover, he European Central Bank’s (ECB) conventional response o a rise in inflation may have a drastic impac on individual households; home loans will become more expensive and job security will become more a risk. Thus, how o bes contain inflation is a hotly con­ tested opic. In essence, he optimal response is always a rade-off between combating inflation on he one hand and he consequences of combating it, i.e., dampened economic developmen and the associated rise in unemployment, on he other. When confronted with his rade-off, policymakers end o decide to olerate rising inflation rather han he real economic con­ sequences of combating it; as German Chancellor Helmu Schmid said in 1972, “Be er five percen inflation han five percen unemployment.”1 However, policymakers frequently do no consider he dam­ aging effects of inflation on he population, such as a loss of purchasing power of savings; lower real purchasing power of salaries and pensions; he corresponding adjustments in the economy; and he implied redistribution of wealth from creditors o debtors. When he ECB was founded in 1998, grea value was placed on its primary objective of price stability—two percen infla­ tion over he medium erm of around wo years—and neces­ sary independence from politics. While supporting general economic policies is its secondary objective, he ECB’s man­ date clearly states ha he secondary objective may only be pursued if his does no compromise he primary",
    "objective.2 Thus, he ECB’s decision o no increase interes rates amid rising inflation in early 2022 stirred up controversy. ECB 1 In a July 28, 1972, interview with he Süddeutsche Zeitung, Helmu Schmid said, “I seems o be ha he German people—to pu i bluntly—can be er deal with a five percen increase in pric­ es han five percen unemployment.” The abridged quotation is from he October 14, 2006, issue of Der Spiegel (in German; available online. Accessed on October 2, 2024. This applies o all other online sources in his report). 2 Michael Ioannidis e al., “The mandate of he ECB: Legal considerations in he ECB’s monetary policy strategy review,” ECB Occasional Paper Series no. 276 (2021). 243 DIW Weekly Repor 40+41+42/2024 MONETARY POLICY Presiden Christine Lagarde defended he decision, saying tha an interes rate hike could no stop he increase in prices. This statemen was based on he fac ha he price increases in he euro area were primarily due o higher energy prices. A widely held opinion was ha an interes rate hike would miss he mark: Although i would curb overall economic demand and hus economic developmen in he euro area, i would have no impac on energy prices, which are primarily determined on he world market.3 This assumption allowed the ECB o—despite its primary mandate and excessive infla­ tion—choose a strategy ha did no endanger he economic recovery of he euro area. Using a ime series model, his Weekly Repor investigates he effects of his monetary policy strategy. Furthermore, i empirically analyses which mone­ tary policy strategy he ECB could have used o provide he optimal response o rising energy prices while stabilizing inflation a wo percent, and wha impac his strategy would have had on he economic developmen of he euro area. 3 However, studies show ha his view is based on erroneous assumptions and ha he ECB’s decisions do influence energy prices within he euro area as well as global energy prices, cf.

A brief introduction o empirical monetary policy analysis We use an empirical model o analyze he macroeconomic effects of he ECB’s monetary policy response o he mos recen surge in inflation.4 This model incorporates he dynamic relationships between he macroeconomic vari­ ables and, furthermore, makes i possible o calculate he causal effects of he ECB’s monetary policy strategy. These effects can in urn be broken down into wo parts using he empirical model. One par is he policy rule, which repre­ sents he endogenous componen of monetary policy and describes how he ECB’s interes rate policy responds his­ torically and systematically o changes in inflation and eco­ nomic output. The other par is an exogenous componen tha includes monetary policy shocks, unexpected deviations from his systematic rule, such as he ECB’s decision o raise 4 This Weekly Repor is based on",

The paper also contains a horough description of he methodology. Box 1 Model and data We use a structural vector autoregressive ime series model (SVAR) o investigate how he monetary policy decisions of he ECB have impacted consumer prices, energy prices, and industrial production in he euro area since January 2020. Mathematically, the model can be wri en as: BY = c + AYt−1 + … + ApYt−p + εt. where vector Y indicates he values of he endogenous variables a ime , whereby Yt−1 indicates he values of hese variables in he previous period. Thus, he developmen of all variables in he com­ mon system depends on he value of he other variables a ime and he value of he variables in he pas p periods. These mutual interdependencies are characterized by he matrices B and A. Vector ε describes he “structural shocks” ha he economy is ex­ posed o in each period and are he drivers of he dynamic system. The SVAR model in his Weekly Repor builds off an empirical model from an earlier Weekly Repor and models he common developmen of en macroeconomic variables.1 Monthly data are used for he estimation. The sampling period was from January 2002 o October 2023, including he coronavirus pandemic. To accoun for he impac of pandemic-related factors and o estimate their economic effects, we use a process particularly developed for this purpose.2 1 Gökhan Ider e al., “And Ye They Move: Energy Prices Fall When Key Interes Rates Increase, Despite Countervailing Effects,” DIW Weekly Repor no. 8 (2023): 73-80 (available online). 2 Danilo Cascaldi-Garcia, “Pandemic priors,” International Finance Discussion Paper 1352 (2022). The SVAR model makes i possible o decompose he ECB’s monetary policy and he associated interes rate path into wo components. Firs is he monetary policy rule, which represents the endogenous components of monetary policy, describes how the interes rate policy of he ECB responds historically and sys­ tematically o changes in inflation, economic output, and other endogenous variables. Second is he exogenous componen ha describes monetary policy shocks, or unexpected deviations from this systematic rule. To estimate he causal effects of unexpected conventional monetary policy shocks and shocks due o monetary policy announcements (forward guidance), he changes in financial marke expectations are measured over short-term interes rates (three months) as well as longer-term interes rates (two years) in a 30-minute ime window around he ECB’s monetary policy deci­ sions. If he expectations change in his ime window, hen here is an unexpected and hus exogenous componen in he ECB’s decision with which he financial markets, and hus companies and households, did no expect.3 Based on his identifying assumption, the historical decomposition makes i possible o calculate he role of he exogenous componen and hus he impac of deviations from he monetary policy rule.4 3 For a more detailed explanation of",
    "he methods, see Gökhan Ider e al., “Friend, No Foe – Energy Prices and European Monetary Policy,” DIW Discussion Papers no. 2089 (2024) (available online). 4 Lutz Kilian and Helmu Lütkepohl, Structural Vector Autoregressive Analysis (Cambridge Uni­ versity Press: 2017). 244 DIW Weekly Repor 40+41+42/2024 MONETARY POLICY interes rates in April 2011 despite he ongoing effects of he financial crisis. This Weekly Repor firs estimates he contribution of he exogenous componen of monetary policy on he European economy and investigates how he economy would have developed withou he exogenous component, meaning with­ ou a deviation from its historical, systematic monetary pol­ icy. This sheds ligh on o wha exten he policy strategy cho­ sen was historically unusual and wha its impac was. We then examine wha impac he optimal design of he endog­ enous componen would have had on he developmen of the economy. ECB policy contributed o economic recovery We employ a process called historical decompositions o analyze if and o wha exten he ECB deviated from its ra­ ditional monetary policy rule during he previous inflation surge and wha he macroeconomic effects of his deviation are (Box 1). This makes i possible o decompose he ime series of variables into a rend ha is independen of mone­ tary policy shocks and curren short-term economic develop­ ments as well as into deviations from his rend. These devi­ ations from he rend, in urn, can be explained by structural shocks, such as exogenous events (like he coronavirus pan­ demic), unexpected changes in he supply of and demand for goods and services, and unexpected monetary policy shocks. The ECB can change short-term interes rates unexpect­ edly, which is generally described as a conventional mone­ tary policy shock. I can also influence longer-term interes rates by applying “forward guidance,” or making a surprise announcemen on its future monetary policy intentions. The results of he historical decomposition show ha eco­ nomic activity in he euro area, measured by industrial pro­ duction, experienced a sharp decline and was well below the rend rate a he onse of he pandemic. The model cor­ rectly a ributes his decline o he effects of he coronavirus pandemic (Figure 1). The ECB responded o hese extraor­ dinary circumstances and passed surprising, expansionary monetary policy measures o stimulate aggregate demand and suppor he recovery of he European economy, such as the extensive Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP). The effects of he monetary policy shocks associated with hese measures were consistently very positive during the firs wo years of he coronavirus pandemic (Figure 1). Withou he ECB’s expansionary policy, industrial produc­ tion would have been up o 2.5 percen lower and he eco­ nomic recovery would have aken much longer. Monetary policy strategy exacerbated he energy price crisis and boosted inflation However, while he ECB’s continued expansionary monetary policy supported he economic recovery, i also played a key role in he rise in inflation after he pandemic. A he begin­ ning of 2020, inflation in he euro area declined initially",

A he beginning of 2022, inflation was over hree percentage points higher han he wo percen ar­ ge and rose subsequently o an unprecedented level. The historical decomposition analysis shows ha pandemic-re­ lated factors and other non-monetary shocks, such as Russia’s tightened energy supply since 2021 and he Russian inva­ sion of Ukraine in February 2022, were primarily responsi­ ble for he surge in inflation. However, he ECB’s expansion­ ary monetary policy also played a major role. In particular, he ECB’s lack of response o he rise in infla­ tion actually represented a deviation from its monetary pol­ icy rule. Thus, he monetary policy followed by he ECB during he 2022 inflation surge was unusually expansion­ ary. The results show ha withou he deviation from he empirically estimated historical monetary policy rule, energy and consumer price inflation would have been much lower. In October 2022, for example, when consumer price infla­ tion was eigh percentage points above he wo percen ar­ get, nearly 1.8 percentage points of his increase were due to monetary policy shocks and hus he ECB. The situation is similar for energy prices, where, for example, up o five percentage points of he observed price increase of 30 per­ cen in January 2022 can be a ributed o expansionary mon­ etary policy measures. Economic developmen under an optimal monetary policy rule While he firs analysis provides insigh into he importance of he unexpected, exogenous componen of monetary pol­ icy during he las surge of inflation, he second par of his Weekly Repor analyzes he endogenous component, i.e., the systematic reaction of he interes rates o changes in the economy. This componen plays a particularly impor­ tan role in firms’ and households’ expectations regarding future economic development. Prices and wages are se or negotiated in view of expected inflation. A he same ime, firms and households make decisions abou long-term invest­ ments and consumption, forming heir expectations of future interes rates and economic activity depending on he per­ ceived monetary policy rule. If monetary policy now system­ atically operates in such a way ha households and firms are firmly convinced ha he ECB will resolutely counter devi­ ations in inflation from he wo percen arget, hey will no expec high inflation rates and will adjus heir expectations abou future interes rates as well as heir consumption and investmen decisions accordingly. For he following analysis, i is assumed ha he ECB is focus­ ing solely on its primary mandate of price stability and ha",
    "there are no deviations from his objective. Thus, he ECB influences shor and longer-term interes rates in such a way ha inflation is a wo percen in he medium erm and ignores everything else, such as general economic develop­ ments. The analysis uses an empirical model ha makes i possible o answer he counterfactual question of how he economy in he euro area would have developed if he ECB had focused chiefly on its primary mandate, an inflation ar­ ge of abou wo percen (Box 2). In his counterfactual scenario, he economy faces he same shocks as was he reality—the coronavirus pandemic and he energy price crisis—bu he ECB responds systematically o Box 2 Estimating economic developmen under mandate-optimal monetary policy To calculate he economic developmen ha would have oc­ curred under a mandate-optimal monetary policy, we assume tha he ECB selects its systematic interes rate policy and thus its monetary policy in a way ha i can optimally achieve its primary mandate of price stability. This means ha he ECB aims o minimize deviations from he inflation arge of wo percent. This can be expressed in a loss function: . This loss function cumulates he inflation deviation from he two percen arget, whereby he various weights (wi) are se­ lected in such a way ha inflation deviations in he “medium term” are given a particularly high weighting. This accounts for he fac ha he ECB defines its primary mandate as price stability in he “medium erm,” which, in practice, is considered to be four o six quarters. Empirical methods can be used o calculate an optimal monetary policy rule.1 Based on his, i is possible o simulate how he euro area economy would have developed from April 2021 onward if he ECB’s declared ob­ jective had been o achieve he primary mandate in he mos optimal way. This means ha he economy in his scenario continues o be exposed o he same exogenous shocks, in­ cluding he coronavirus pandemic and he energy price crisis. However, he ECB responds differently o hese events in his scenario, which is why he macroeconomic impac of hese exogenous shocks is different. A he same ime, he ECB’s alternative monetary policy changes he existing economic developmen even withou he resulting change in he effects of he new exogenous shocks. This is because a change in he monetary policy rule also influences dynamic adjustmen pro­ cesses within he economy ha were already initiated before the change. The sum of hese responses o new exogenous shocks and he already existing dynamic adjustmen process­ es results in an interes rate path for he shor and longer-term interes rates, which influences he overall economic situation and he financial markets and ultimately leads o he ECB opti­ mally achieving its primary mandate.2 1 Tomas E. Caravello e al., “Evaluating Policy Counterfactuals: A VAR-Plus Approach,” NBER Working Paper 32988 (2024). 2 For a more detailed description of he methods, see Gökhan Ider e al., “Friend, No Foe – Energy Prices",
    "and European Monetary Policy,” DIW Discussion Papers no. 2089 (2024) (available online). 246 DIW Weekly Repor 40+41+42/2024 MONETARY POLICY these events exclusively according o its mandate of price stability. This response results in an interes rate path for the shor and longer-term interes rates ha influences he overall economic situation and he financial markets and ultimately leads o he ECB optimally achieving its primary mandate (Box 2). Earlier ECB intervention could have prevented he inflation surge The developmen of interes rates under a mandate-optimal policy rule differs greatly from heir actual development. In particular, he ECB should have implemented a strong ini­ tial interes rate hike by increasing he short-term and long- term interes rates by up o 100 basis points. According o the estimates, he ECB could have prevented he sharp rise in inflation with his strategy. One reason for his is ha he ECB’s interes rate policy, contrary o he ECB’s assumptions described above, directly influences energy prices and he higher interes rates are very quickly reflected in noticeably lower energy prices. For example, a change in he monetary policy course would have caused demand for energy in he euro area o drop drastically while simultaneously appreciating he euro. This would have further dampened energy price inflation in he euro area.5 Another reason is ha an announcemen ha he ECB would pursue a policy aimed primarily and vigorously a stabiliz­ ing inflation a wo percen would also have mean ha infla­ tion expectations would no have risen so sharply. This in turn would have reduced inflationary pressures, as produc­ ers, among others, would have forecas lower future costs. Due o he less pronounced rise in inflation, he ECB would have hen avoided higher interes rates from 2023 onward. Combating inflation would have led o only a short- term economic slump Such a change in monetary policy would have led o an ini­ tial sharper drop in production as measured by industrial production. Considering he relative volatility of GDP and industrial production, we see ha GDP would have been around hree percen below its actual level a he rough of the crisis if he ECB had stabilized inflation a around wo percen (Figure 2). However, his slump would have been brief; otal production would have returned o its actual level by he end of 2023. This shows ha he conflicting objectives faced by he ECB during he energy crisis were of a short- term nature. This surprising resul is because, contrary o its own statements and assumptions, he ECB can in fac directly influence energy prices by curbing energy demand and appreciating he euro.6 Thus, he ECB could have coun­ teracted he rise in inflation driven by he increase in energy 5 Ider e al., “And Ye They Move.” 6 Ider e al., “And Ye They Move”; Alexander Roth and Felix Schmidt, “No only a mild winter: German consumers change heir behavior o save natural gas,” Joule 7, no. 6 (2023): 1081–1086 (available online).

Conclusion: ECB caugh between price stability and limited capacity for action The results of his Weekly Repor sugges ha he ECB con­ tributed o a further increase in prices with its hesitan action, including both he exogenous components ha fueled he rise in prices and he ECB’s wait-and-see response. With a stricter and more vigorous monetary policy course, he ECB would have been able o preven inflation rising o 10 percen a he cos of a brief recession a a ime in which he economy was already weakened by he coronavirus pandemic and he Russian invasion of Ukraine. The ECB may have no wanted to exacerbate he situation. In addition, concerns abou he stability of he financial sector may also have prompted he ECB o no raise interes rates oo quickly. The ECB’s false assumption ha i canno influence energy prices may have led i o pu more weigh on stabilizing he economic and political situation in he euro area, rather han following its primary mandate of price stability. Ultimately, however, he analysis also shows ha i has become more challenging for he ECB o fulfill its primary mandate of price stability in he economic environmen a tha ime. This is because i would have needed he free­ dom o no have o consider he economic situation in he larges economies (Germany, France, and Italy) as well as their national deb and financial markets when raising inter­ es rates. However, he ECB does no have his freedom because he euro countries are far from having a common financial policy. Instead, i falls o he ECB o implemen an economic policy for he entire euro area and o conceal its various design flaws.7 Firs and foremost, his includes he lack of a capital markets union and of a fiscal union with a common bond for all euro area countries. Only hen will the ECB be able o effectively figh inflation in he future. Otherwise, i will continue o face he impossible challenge of squaring he circle. 7 Former ECB Presiden Mario Draghi also recently made similar suggestions for improve­ ment, cf.
