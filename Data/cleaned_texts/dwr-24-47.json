Preliminary results from an \n\nongoing research project show that the fleet of battery-electric \n\ntrucks as well as the number of models on offer have recently \n\ngrown significantly, albeit from a very low level. This is not the \n\ncase for hydrogen trucks. Considerable amounts of invest­\n\nment from the private sector are flowing into the charging \n\ninfrastructure. Compared to hydrogen trucks, battery-electric \n\nvehicles have major advantages when it comes to energy \n\nefficiency, foreseeable energy costs, and their expected and \n\nrealistic contribution to climate change mitigation. Policymak­\n\ners should therefore set a clear focus on ramping up battery-­\n\nelectric trucks while expanding the charging infrastructure, the \n\nfast charging network more vigorously in particular. To face \n\npossible challenges, especially when it comes to grid connec­\n\ntions, battery swapping systems, or overhead line systems—\n\nwhich have a large technological overlap with battery-electric \n\ntrucks—could be tested further. Furthermore, the energy \n\nefficiency advantages of battery-electric trucks should be con­\n\nsidered in the greenhouse gas reduction quota system.\n\nGermany has set a goal to become climate neutral by 2045. \n\nThis requires climate change mitigation measures in all eco­\n\nnomic sectors, including road freight transport. One impor­\n\ntant strategy for this sector is switching from diesel trucks \n\nto battery-electric or hydrogen trucks.\n\nThis Weekly Report provides an overview of the current fleet \n\nand market development trends of battery-electric and hydro­\n\ngen trucks as well as of the expansion of the charging and \n\nrefueling infrastructure. Next, it discusses the advantages \n\nand drawbacks of alternative technologies as well as their \n\npossible contributions to climate change mitigation. The \n\ndata used in this Weekly Report are drawn from prelimi­\n\nnary results of an ongoing research project of the Institute \n\nfor Energy and Environmental Research (Institut für Energie- \n\nund Umweltforschung Heidelberg, ifeu), TU Dresden, and \n\nDIW Berlin.1\n\nNecessity of and options for climate change \n\nmitigation in road freight transport\n\nRoad freight ranges from urban distribution and delivery \n\ntransport via light commercial vehicles to trans-national \n\nheavy goods transport. A variety of vehicles are used for \n\nsuch transport, differing in aspects such as configuration \n\nand permitted gross weight. Vehicles heavier than 3.5 tons \n\nare known as heavy-duty vehicles. The Federal Motor \n\nTransport Authority (Kraftfahrt Bundesamt, KBA) differen­\n\ntiates between straight trucks (Lastkraftwagen) and tractor \n\nunits (Zugmaschinen). Especially relevant for heavy goods \n\ntransport is the subgroup of semi-trailer trucks.2 Semi-trailer \n\ntrucks cover daily distances of 400 to 500 kilometers on aver­\n\nage, much greater than other trucks (around 300 kilometers).\n\n1\t\n\nThis Weekly Report is based on two recently published project reports: Julia Pelzeter et al., \n\nBewertung von Technologiekonfigurationen für den Straßengüterverkehr (ifeu, TU Dresden, \n\nDIW Berlin: 20224) (in German; available online. Accessed on October 28, 2024. This applies to \n\nall ­other online sources in this report unless stated otherwise) as well as Julius Jöhrens et al., \n\nKomplementär­technologien zu BEV-Lkw – ein techno-ökonomischer Vergleich (ifeu, TU Dresden, \n\nDIW Berlin: 2024) (in German; available online).\n\n2\t Colloquially and also in this report, the term “truck” is used in such a way that it includes both \n\ntrucks and tractor units as defined by official statistics.\n\n289\n\nDIW Weekly Report 47+48/2024\n\nELECTRIC TRUCKS\n\nRoad freight causes significant greenhouse gas emissions in \n\nGermany, and the emissions keep rising. Commercial vehi­\n\ncles weighing over 3.5 tons were responsible for 28 percent \n\nof emissions from the transport sector and for around six \n\npercent of total German greenhouse gas emissions in 2022.3 \n\nAround two thirds of these commercial vehicles weighed \n\nover 26 tons; they are mainly used for long-distance routes.\n\nVarious alternative drive options\n\nPossible strategies for climate change mitigation in road \n\nfreight are avoiding transport, switching to rail freight, and \n\nusing alternative drives. There appears to be limited poten­\n\ntial for avoiding transport and switching to rail freight.4 Thus, \n\nthe focus is on switching from diesel trucks to battery-electric \n\nvehicles, which requires an expansion of the fast-charging \n\ninfrastructure. There are also two hydrogen-based options: \n\nVehicles with hydrogen combustion engines and vehicles \n\nwith fuel cells and an electric motor. Both types require \n\nhydrogen refueling stations.\n\nThere has also been some discussion of retaining diesel \n\nengines while using biofuels or synthetic fuels based on \n\ngreen hydrogen (e-fuels). However, we do not investigate \n\n3 Authors’ calculations based on the Transport Emission Model (TREMOD), version 6.61 as well \n\nas data from the Federal Environment Agency (Umweltbundesamt, UBA) (in German; available \n\n online).\n\n4 Cf.

By 2035 and 2040, they must have 65 and 90 percent \n\nlower emissions, respectively, than in 2019.9 These targets \n\n5 Wolf-Peter Schill, “E-Fuels: Ja, aber nicht für Pkw,” commentary in DIW Wochenbericht no. 17 \n\n(2021): 304 (in German; available online); as well as Falko Ueckerdt and Adrian Odenweller, \n\nE- Fuels – Aktueller Stand und Projektionen (2023) (in German; available online).\n\n6 Bundesregierung, Klimaschutzprogramm 2030 der Bundesregierung zur Umsetzung des Klima-\n\nschutzplans 2050 (2019) (in German; available online).\n\n7 Sachverständigenrat für Wirtschaftsfragen, Güterverkehr zwischen Infrastrukturanforderungen \n\nund Dekarbonisierung.\n\n8 Regulation (EU) 2024/1610 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 May 2024 \n\n(available online).\n\n9 There are exceptions for small-volume manufacturers, mining, agriculture, and forestry, as \n\nwell as for vehicles for military, civil defense, public safety, and medical care purposes.\n\nFigure 1\n\nRoad freight vehicle fleet in Germany\n\nShare of alternative drives in percent\n\n \n\nNote: Hydrogen includes fuel cells and hydrogen combustion engines.\n\nSources: Data from the Federal Motor Transport Authority, aggregated and visualized in the Open Energy Tracker (in German; available online).\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nThe battery-electric vehicle fleet is growing from a low level, while the hydrogen fleet is barely growing.\n\n290\n\nDIW Weekly Report 47+48/2024\n\nELECTRIC TRUCKS\n\ncan probably only be achieved with a rapid increase in newly \n\nregistered trucks with electric drives.10\n\nCurrent market development favors battery-\n\nelectric vehicles\n\nCurrently, there are around 3.8 million trucks in Germany, \n\n530,000 of which weigh more than 3.5 tons. In addition, \n\nthere are 236,000 semi-trailer trucks (Figure 1).11 Diesel \n\nengines dominate overwhelmingly in both sectors: 92 per­\n\ncent of trucks and 97 percent of semi-trailer trucks have \n\ndiesel engines. Only around 2.3 percent of trucks are pure \n\nbattery- electric trucks; most are light commercial vehicles \n\nweighing less than 3.5 tons. Only 0.3 percent of semi-trailer \n\ntrucks are battery electric.\n\nHowever, the shares of new registrations of battery-electric \n\nvehicles are markedly higher (Figure 2). This has resulted \n\nin a considerable recent increase in the fleet of battery-elec­\n\ntric vehicles, albeit from a low level. On average over the last \n\n10 For more on the decarbonization of road freight and the possible roles different technologies \n\ncan play, cf.

Further, there is no \n\npositive trend in new registrations of hydrogen vehicles.\n\nConsiderable increase in number of electric vehicle \n\nmodels\n\nA wide variety of available models is important for the market \n\npotential of electric trucks due to factors such as route pro­\n\nfiles, differing requirements in the logistics sector depending \n\non the type of good being transported, and the often strong \n\nbrand loyalty of truck operators.\n\n12 Among other things, changes to the fleet targets for newly registered trucks as well as to sub­\n\nsidy programs account for outliers in individual months. At the federal level, for example, there \n\nwas a subsidy financed by the Climate and Transformation Fund (Klima- und Transformations-\n\nfonds, KTF)) for the purchase of battery-electric or hydrogen commercial vehicles until 2023. This \n\nsubsidy was ended without a replacement following the ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court \n\non November 15, 2023, and the subsequent budget consolidation. However, there are still individu­\n\nal subsidy programs at the state level, cf. ifeu overview (in German; available online).\n\nIn total, 164 different models in the sector of heavy trucks \n\nand semi-trailer trucks weighing over 3.5 tons could be iden­\n\ntified on the German market in October 2024 (Figure 3).13 \n\nOne hundred and forty-one of these models (86 percent) are \n\nalready available and 23 have been announced (14 percent). \n\nThus, compared to an earlier evaluation in October 2022 \n\nwhen 65 models were available, the number of models on \n\noffer has more than doubled.\n\nAround 80 percent of these models are battery electric, while \n\nthe remaining 20 percent have a fuel cell drive. Hydrogen \n\nvehicles are rather well represented in the model range com­\n\npared to their current niche role in existing and new vehicle \n\nregistrations.14 However, a small number of specialist compa­\n\nnies produce a large share of hydrogen trucks, and most of \n\nthem concentrate on converting vehicles from other manu­\n\nfacturers. Of the major manufacturers in Europe, in contrast, \n\nonly six offer or have announced fuel cell vehicles (Figure 4).\n\n13 A vehicle model is determined by eight parameters: manufacturer, drive system, drive power, \n\nbattery capacity, hydrogen tank capacity, fuel cell capacity, and number of axels. As there can be \n\nmany different configurations per model (for example, battery capacity or number of axels), only \n\nthe greatest battery capacity and the smallest number of axels are evaluated as separate models.\n\n14 This also applies when compared to the significantly larger passenger vehicle market, in \n\nwhich only two fuel cell models are currently available in Germany.\n\nFigure 4\n\nVehicle models listed by manufacturer\n\nNumber as of October 2024\n\n \n\nNotes: Retrofitters are specialist firms that usually have a low number of vehicles they produce, as they mainly focus on retrofitting vehicles of other manufacturers.\n\nSource: The ifeu’s truck database.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nThe major manufacturers mainly offer battery-electric trucks. Most fuel cell trucks are offered by retrofitters.\n\n292\n\nDIW Weekly Report 47+48/2024\n\nELECTRIC TRUCKS\n\nstrategy,17 Daimler is pursuing a dual strategy with bat­\n\ntery-electric drives and fuel cells to power heavy long-haul \n\ntransport.18 Other manufacturers use a “three-pillar model” \n\nincluding renewable fuels (Volvo)19 or a “technology-neu­\n\ntral multi-drive approach” (Iveco).20 Only Renault Trucks \n\nwill explicitly exclude fossil combustion engines from 2040 \n\nonward.21 Volvo, MAN, DAF, and Iveco also include the hydro­\n\ngen combustion engine as an option to varying degrees.\n\nInformation provided by manufacturers at “cleanroom dis­\n\ncussions”,22 which have been initiated by the Federal Ministry \n\nfor Digital and Transport (Bundesministerium für Digitales \n\nund Verkehr, BMDV) to better assess the future roll-out of \n\nlow-carbon trucks, shows that the market share of pure bat­\n\ntery-electric drives in heavy commercial vehicles is expected \n\nto increase significantly in the coming years. By 2030, they \n\nwill make up around half of all sales in the over 12 tons \n\nweight class. Various other technologies will play more of a \n\nsupplementary role.\n\nRamp-up of charging and refueling infrastructure\n\nBattery-electric and hydrogen drives face different challenges \n\nwhen it comes to their public energy supply infrastructure. In \n\nmany cases, battery-electric trucks can recharge the majority \n\nof their battery at a depot, provided that the grid connections \n\nand vehicle profiles allow it. However, a certain amount of \n\nfast charging is required, especially in long-distance trans­\n\nport.23 Hydrogen trucks, on the other hand, cannot be refu­\n\neled in depots, but are generally dependent on public hydro­\n\ngen refueling stations, as the construction and operation of \n\nrefueling stations is expensive compared to electric depot \n\ncharging stations.\n\nExpansion of the fast-charging infrastructure\n\nThe established Combined Charging System (CCS) stand­\n\nard is available for charging infrastructure up to a capac­\n\nity of 400 kilowatts. Currently, 31,000 CCS charging sta­\n\ntions are publicly available in Germany.24 In general, they are \n\ndesigned for passenger cars, but some can also serve trucks. \n\n17 MAN, Strategie – MAN auf einen Blick (2024) (in German; available online); Scania, Das Be­\n\nkenntnis von Scania zu batteriebetriebenen Elektrofahrzeugen (2021) (in German; available online).\n\n18 Daimler Truck, Diskussion Batterie vs. Wasserstoff: Daimler Truck setzt mit beiden Technologien \n\nkonsequent auf Doppelstrategie (2022) (in German; available online).\n\n19 Volvo Trucks, Gemeinsam in Richtung null Emissionen: Unser Weg zur Dekarbonisierung des \n\nTransports (2024) (in German; available online).\n\n20 IVECO Group, Iveco Group präsentiert Multi-Antriebs-Strategie und stellt innovative Lösungen \n\nauf der IAA TRANSPORTATION 2024 vor (2024) (in German; available online).\n\n21 Renault Trucks, Renault Trucks bietet ab 2023 eine elektrische Baureihe für jedes Markt-\n\nsegment an (2021) (in German; available online); cf.

Informa­\n\ntion on the charging infrastructure is regularly prepared in the Open Energy Tracker (in German; \n\navailable online).\n\nA good 80 percent of the models, almost exclusively bat­\n\ntery-electric trucks, have a range of less than 500 kilome­\n\nters. The focus is on ranges of 200 to 300 kilometers, which \n\ncan cover regional transport (Figure 5).15 There are a few \n\nbattery-electric models with a range of over 500 kilometers, \n\nbut most of these are equipped with a fuel cell drive. Range \n\nis an important aspect in ongoing discussions about poten­\n\ntial benefits of fuel cell vehicles, which is clearly reflected in \n\nthe available models.\n\nThe available models cover all size classes of commercial \n\nvehicles.16 More than half of the models have a gross vehi­\n\ncle weight of over 12 tons. While the larger vehicles tend to \n\nhave a somewhat greater range, the range profile is simi­\n\nlar for all vehicle sizes. This also applies to the semi-trailer \n\ntrucks that are common in long-distance transport, as these \n\ncan currently usually only be ordered with the same battery \n\nsizes as trucks over 12 tons.\n\nVarious manufacturer strategies\n\nIndividual manufacturers differ greatly in their view on the \n\nstrategic importance of hydrogen drives. While the TRATON \n\nGroup (MAN / Scania), for example, has strongly empha­\n\nsized the economic advantages of battery-electric vehicles in \n\nrecent years and views them as the clear focus of its corporate \n\n15 The range is calculated per vehicle model using the net battery capacity as well as typical \n\n energy consumption (battery capacity/energy consumption = range).\n\n16 Here we consider the size classes N2 (< 12 tons) and N3 (> 12 tons).

To solve \n\nthis issue, a new fast charging standard is being developed \n\nand is nearly ready to be introduced, the Megawatt Charging \n\nSystem (MCS). The MCS should make charging capacities \n\nof up to 3.75 megawatts (3,750 kilowatts) possible.25\n\nRecently, various private sector actors have announced plans \n\nto build specific truck charging stations in over 200 locations, \n\nand construction has already begun on some of them (Table). \n\nOn the government side, the BMDV and the Federal Ministry \n\nfor Digital and Transport (Bundesministerium für Digitales und \n\nVerkehr, BMDV) have launched an initiative for a fast-charg­\n\ning network for trucks26 that includes around 350 locations \n\non federal highways. An initial tender for truck charging sta­\n\ntions at around 130 unmanaged rest areas has already been \n\nlaunched,27 with another to follow. For all planned station \n\nlocations, the electrical connection capacities required and \n\ncorresponding grid connections have already been planned \n\nand applied for.\n\nThe public fast charging infrastructure is primarily needed \n\nto make it possible for battery-electric trucks to cover the typ­\n\nical long-distance transport profiles. This infrastructure will \n\nlikely be of great importance for compliance with the stricter \n\nEuropean fleet CO2 targets from 2030 onward. Until pub­\n\nlic truck charging infrastructure is widely available, many \n\n25 The charging infrastructure capacity for passenger vehicles is considerably lower in contrast. \n\nCurrently, direct current fast charging stations can achieve a maximum of 0.4 megawatts. Typical \n\nalternating current charging stations only achieve 0.022 megawatts.\n\n26 BMWK and BMDV, “Startschuss für das Lkw-Schnellladenetz,” press release from July 3, 2024 \n\n(in German; available online).\n\n27 BMDV, “Ausschreibung für Lkw-Schnellladeinfrastruktur gestartet,” press release from Sep­\n\ntember 16, 2024 (2024) (in German; available online); Nationale Leitstelle Ladeinfrastruktur, Stand-\n\norte für das LKW-Schnellladenetz an Rastanlagen mit benötigten Netzanschlussleistungen (in \n\nGerman; available online); Nationale Leitstelle Ladeinfrastruktur, Standorte für das LKW-Schnell-\n\nladenetz an Rastanlagen mit benötigten Netzanschlussleistungen (in German; available online).\n\nbattery-electric trucks can rely on depot charging, especially \n\ntrucks used for regional transport, which can in turn pro­\n\nmote the market ramp-up of electric trucks.28\n\nChallenges for hydrogen refueling stations\n\nTo date, hydrogen refueling stations have mainly been \n\nplanned for passenger cars at a pressure level of 700 bar. \n\nHowever, trucks require a lower pressure of 350 bar, which \n\nonly around half of the existing refueling stations can cur­\n\nrently provide. As of September 2024, there are 42 refue­\n\nling stations with a pressure level of 350 bar.29 Some man­\n\nufacturers are also considering using liquid hydrogen in \n\nfuture vehicle models, which entails uncertainty regarding \n\nthe construction of new refueling stations.30 The previous \n\nfunding for hydrogen refueling stations from the Climate \n\nand Transformation Fund (Klima- und Transformationfonds, \n\nKTF) was discontinued due to funding problems.\n\nWhile there are concrete private sector activities and gov­\n\nernment tenders being undertaken for the battery-electric \n\ntruck charging infrastructure, there is much more planning \n\nuncertainty when it comes to the construction of hydrogen \n\nrefueling stations. On the government side, the main issue \n\nis how to ensure compliance with the European minimum \n\ninfrastructure requirements31 and whether the targets need \n\nto be adapted to the new market reality.32\n\n28 Pelzeter et al., Bewertung von Technologiekonfigurationen für den Straßengüterverkehr.\n\n29 BMDV, Informationsveranstaltung zum nationalen Strategierahmen gemäß EU-Verordnung \n\nüber den Aufbau der Infrastruktur für alternative Kraftstoffe (AFIR) (2024) (in German; available \n\n online).\n\n30 Cf.

However, a sys­\n\ntematic comparison of different criteria shows that this tech­\n\nnology is also facing various challenges,33 including integra­\n\ntion into the power grid and the effects on the stability of the \n\nenergy system, the space required for the charging infrastruc­\n\nture, the raw materials required for batteries, the operational \n\nchanges required for logistics firms, and the cost of vehicles.\n\nHydrogen has some advantages, but many \n\ndrawbacks\n\nHydrogen drives have advantages when it comes to some \n\nof the observed criteria. For example, they do not require \n\nfast charging infrastructure to be connected to the power \n\ngrid, and thus neither any reinforcement measures in the \n\n33 This section is based on an analysis by Jöhrens et al., Komplementärtechnologien zu BEV-Lkw.\n\nhigher voltage network. The space requirement and the need \n\nfor operational adjustments at logistics firms are also rated \n\nas slightly more favorable than for battery-electric trucks.34 \n\nHowever, hydrogen trucks have some of their own chal­\n\nlenges when it comes to infrastructure expansion and energy \n\ncosts, which ultimately comes down to their poor energy effi­\n\nciency (Box). In addition, uncertainty around future energy \n\ncost appears to be significantly higher for hydrogen trucks \n\nthan for battery-electric trucks. This is due to the fact that \n\nthe hydrogen market hardly exists to date, but it has a large \n\nnumber of potential future consumers.\n\nIn light of the foreseeable high hydrogen demand from other \n\nsectors, especially industry, it seems questionable whether \n\nsignificant quantities of green hydrogen can be made avail­\n\nable for road freight in the medium term. Barely any pro­\n\njects have been realized so far, both in domestic production \n\nas well as planned hydrogen imports.35\n\n34 Pelzeter et al., Bewertung von Technologiekonfigurationen für den Straßengüterverkehr.\n\n35 Cf. the Ampel-Monitor Energiewende for the state of elctrolysis and its targets as well as \n\n Martin Kittel et al., “National Hydrogen Strategy: Clear focus and consistent implementation \n\n necessary,” DIW Weekly Report no. 40+41+42 (2023) (available online).\n\nBox\n\nElectricity sector analysis: Advantages of hydrogen storage do not outweigh energy-efficiency drawbacks\n\nAn analysis using DIW Berlin’s open-source electricity sector \n\n model DIETER shows that battery-electric vehicles with fast charg­\n\ning capabilities result in the lowest electricity sector costs of all \n\noptions under observation. Even if the battery-electric vehicles are \n\nnot optimally charged, they still have clear advantages compared \n\nto hydrogen fuel cell vehicles or synthetic hydrogen-based  e-fuels. \n\nThe advantages are even greater if the batteries are flexibly \n\ncharged based on the electricity market price in combination with \n\nvehicle-to-grid charging, where electricity is fed back to the grid at \n\ntimes.\n\nBattery-electric vehicles have such an advantage due to the poor \n\nenergy efficiency of hydrogen and e-fuels, which are assumed \n\nto be domestically produced in the model. Domestic production \n\nresults in considerable costs for the renewable energy used. \n\nHowever, it is often argued that this drawback could be offset by \n\nthe advantageous storage capacity of hydrogen and e-fuels, which \n\nwill become more important in a future energy system with a high \n\nshare of variable wind and solar energy. However, the model anal­\n\nyses show that the energy efficiency drawbacks of hydrogen and \n\ne-fuels clearly outweigh their storage advantages (Figure).1\n\n1 \n\nCarlos Gaete-Morales et al., “Power sector effects of alternative options for de-fossilizing \n\nheavy-duty vehicles—Go electric, and charge smartly,” Cell Reports Sustainability 1, no. 6 (2024): \n\n100123 (available online).

Their emissions balance over the life cycle, when \n\nincluding vehicle production, seems to offer little advantage \n\nin the medium term (Figure 6),36 especially if gray hydro­\n\ngen (hydrogen produced from natural gas) is used. It seems \n\nplausible that gray hydrogen will be used because the pro­\n\nduction costs of green hydrogen are likely to remain higher \n\nthan the costs of gray hydrogen for some time. The emis­\n\nsions balance is even worse if hydrogen is produced via elec­\n\ntrolysis powered by average grid electricity. Even if electrol­\n\nysis were powered entirely by renewable electricity (green \n\nhydrogen), there would not be any emissions advantage over \n\ngrid-powered battery-electric trucks, as the share of renew­\n\nable energy in the power grid is set to rise to at least 80 per­\n\ncent by 2030. When considering life cycles, battery-electric \n\ntrucks thus have considerable emissions advantages com­\n\npared to hydrogen trucks, at least until 2030. Furthermore, \n\nthe analysis shows that the production of vehicles (including \n\nbatteries) only makes up a small share of the climate impact \n\ncompared to power supply during the use phase.\n\nOther electric technologies advantageous in \n\nsubsectors\n\nOther electric technologies that are not currently widely avail­\n\nable on the market but have been tested could partially com­\n\npensate for some weak spots of battery-electric trucks. Such \n\ntechnologies include electric road systems such as overhead \n\nline systems or third-rail systems, which dynamically power \n\nelectric trucks as they drive, making it possible to reduce the \n\nsize of vehicle batteries. Overhead line systems for trucks \n\nhave already been comprehensively tested in Germany.37 \n\nIn addition, battery swapping systems for trucks are under \n\ndiscussion. While such systems are already widespread in \n\nChina, they have not yet been tested much in Germany. Semi-\n\ntrailers with electric axels and their own battery (e-trailer), \n\nwhich could initially be used in combination with diesel trac­\n\ntors, are another possibility.\n\nSome of these technologies have been evaluated as advan­\n\ntageous with respect to a few challenging aspects for the \n\nmarket ramp-up of battery-electric trucks with fast charg­\n\ning (Figure 7).38 Such challenges include network integra­\n\ntion, the contribution to the stability of the energy system, \n\nand the space requirement. However, there is still no sin­\n\ngle technology that equally addresses all of the drawbacks of \n\nbattery-electric trucks. In addition, each type of technology \n\nhas its own challenges: An overhead line system, for exam­\n\nple, requires high initial investment costs for the core net­\n\nwork, and battery swapping systems must be standardized.\n\n36 Julius Jöhrens et al., “Perspektivische Kosten und Klimabilanz von Lkw mit alternativen Antrie­\n\nben 2030,” enERSyn Schwerpunktpapier no. 2 (forthcoming).\n\n37 Julius Jöhrens et al., “Current technical findings on the eHighway system from field tests and \n\naccompanying research in Germany,” Working paper compiled by the German cross-project Work­\n\ning Group on eHighway Technology (AG Technikbewertung) (2022) (available online).\n\n38 Jöhrens et al., Komplementärtechnologien zu BEV-Lkw.\n\nGreenhouse gas reduction quota could create \n\nstrong incentives for hydrogen use\n\nThe greenhouse gas reduction quota (GHG quota) is a \n\nmarket-based climate change mitigation instrument that \n\naims to reduce the use of fossil fuels in the transport sec­\n\ntor. Companies that create fossil fuel emissions in trans­\n\nport are required to reduce their emissions (including fuel \n\nproduction), with the reduction quota increasing each year. \n\nCurrently, the quota is 9.35 percent compared to the fossil \n\nfuel reference value; in 2030, it will rise to 25.1 percent.39 \n\nThere are various options for reducing emissions, such as \n\nusing electric drives or using more electric fuels such as \n\nhydrogen. Companies do not have to meet the quotas them­\n\nselves, but can rather trade emissions via certificates.\n\nHowever, the GHG quota does not adequately account for the \n\nbetter energy efficiency of battery-electric trucks compared to \n\nhydrogen trucks. As a result, higher certificate revenues can \n\nbe achieved by using hydrogen compared to a correspond­\n\ningly lower amount of electricity that can cover the same \n\nmileage with a battery-electric truck. If this revenue is used \n\nto subsidize the sale of green hydrogen at refueling stations, \n\nthe price of hydrogen would decline by around two euros pro \n\nkilogram at the current GHG quota price of around 70 euros \n\nper ton of CO2. If the certificate prices once again rise to the \n\n2022 level of around 400 euros per ton due to rising reduc­\n\ntion quotas, green hydrogen could be subsidized to be sold \n\n39 More information is available on the German customs website (in German; available online).\n\nFigure 6\n\nClimate impact of semi-trailer trucks in long-haul transport \n\nin 2030\n\nGrams of CO2 equivalent per kilometer\n\n \n\nNote: Considering the entire life cycle.\n\nSource: Julius Jöhrens et al., “Perspektivische Kosten und Klimabilanz von Lkw mit alternativen Antrieben 2030,” \n\nenERSyn Schwerpunktpapier, no. 2 (forthcoming, 2024).\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nCompared to battery-electric vehicles, fuel cell vehicles do not cause fewer emissions \n\nover the life cycle even when using green hydrogen.\n\n296\n\nDIW Weekly Report 47+48/2024\n\nELECTRIC TRUCKS\n\nsuggest that a clear political focus on battery-electric trucks \n\nwith stationary battery charging is more advantageous. On \n\nthe one hand, this focus corresponds with the reality of the \n\nmarket and thus supports current private sector activities. \n\nOn the other hand, these technologies correspond with what \n\nis currently the most plausible path for medium and long-\n\nterm effective climate change mitigation in heavy road freight \n\ntransport. Federal policy should clearly communicate bat­\n\ntery-electric trucks as a key technology to give truck manu­\n\nfacturers and operators security in upcoming investments. \n\nGovernment funding of too many alternative technology \n\noptions could, in contrast, lead to planning uncertainty for \n\nvehicle manufacturers, infrastructure providers, and logis­\n\ntics specialists and thus ultimately delay the transition of \n\ntruck drives.\n\nThe current activities in the private sector for ramping up \n\nthe charging infrastructure for battery-electric trucks should \n\n continue to be supported by the government; the correspond­\n\ning tenders are a first positive step in this direction. Activities \n\nto provide the space needed as well as the required network \n\nconnections also seem sensible. Furthermore, the regula­\n\ntions for the GHG quota should be adjusted to adequately \n\naccount for the energy efficiency advantages of battery-elec­\n\ntric trucks.\n\nfor around 12 euros per kilogram. This is in the range of cur­\n\nrent refueling station prices for hydrogen and would drasti­\n\ncally decrease the energy costs of fuel cell trucks, which are \n\npresently high. In this way, the greenhouse gas emissions \n\nrate in its current form could create stronger incentives for \n\nthe use of hydrogen drives than for battery-electric drives.\n\nConclusion: Focus should be on battery-electric \n\ndrives and fast charging\n\nIn the debate on the use of alternative drives in heavy road \n\nfreight transport, actors from vehicle manufacturing, logis­\n\ntics, and the hydrogen business often argue that a broad tech­\n\nnology portfolio is required to quickly and effectively reduce \n\ngreenhouse gas emissions. Some also argue that a portfo­\n\nlio with as many different types of technologies as possible \n\nmakes sense from an industry policy perspective to provide \n\nmarket opportunities for domestic manufacturers.40\n\nHowever, current market developments, systematic energy \n\nefficiency considerations, the energy system effects, and the \n\nmedium-term expected contributions to emissions reduction \n\n40 Cf.

Preliminary results from an \n\nongoing research projec show ha he flee of ba ery-electric \n\ntrucks as well as he number of models on offer have recently \n\ngrown significantly, albei from a very low level. This is no he \n\ncase for hydrogen rucks. Considerable amounts of invest­\n\nmen from he private sector are flowing into he charging \n\ninfrastructure. Compared o hydrogen rucks, ba ery-electric \n\nvehicles have major advantages when i comes o energy \n\nefficiency, foreseeable energy costs, and heir expected and \n\nrealistic contribution o climate change mitigation. Policymak­\n\ners should herefore se a clear focus on ramping up ba ery-­\n\nelectric rucks while expanding he charging infrastructure, he \n\nfas charging network more vigorously in particular. To face \n\npossible challenges, especially when i comes o grid connec­\n\ntions, ba ery swapping systems, or overhead line systems—\n\nwhich have a large echnological overlap with ba ery-electric \n\ntrucks—could be ested further. Furthermore, he energy \n\nefficiency advantages of ba ery-electric rucks should be con­\n\nsidered in he greenhouse gas reduction quota system.\n\nGermany has se a goal o become climate neutral by 2045. \n\nThis requires climate change mitigation measures in all eco­\n\nnomic sectors, including road freigh ransport. One impor­\n\ntan strategy for his sector is switching from diesel rucks \n\nto ba ery-electric or hydrogen rucks.\n\nThis Weekly Repor provides an overview of he curren flee \n\nand marke developmen rends of ba ery-electric and hydro­\n\ngen rucks as well as of he expansion of he charging and \n\nrefueling infrastructure. Next, i discusses he advantages \n\nand drawbacks of alternative echnologies as well as heir \n\npossible contributions o climate change mitigation. The \n\ndata used in his Weekly Repor are drawn from prelimi­\n\nnary results of an ongoing research projec of he Institute \n\nfor Energy and Environmental Research (Institu für Energie- \n\nund Umweltforschung Heidelberg, ifeu), TU Dresden, and \n\nDIW Berlin.1\n\nNecessity of and options for climate change \n\nmitigation in road freigh ransport\n\nRoad freigh ranges from urban distribution and delivery \n\ntranspor via ligh commercial vehicles o rans-national \n\nheavy goods ransport. A variety of vehicles are used for \n\nsuch ransport, differing in aspects such as configuration \n\nand permi ed gross weight. Vehicles heavier han 3.5 tons \n\nare known as heavy-duty vehicles. The Federal Motor \n\nTranspor Authority (Kraftfahr Bundesamt, KBA) differen­\n\ntiates between straigh rucks (Lastkraftwagen) and ractor \n\nunits (Zugmaschinen). Especially relevan for heavy goods \n\ntranspor is he subgroup of semi-trailer rucks.2 Semi-trailer \n\ntrucks cover daily distances of 400 o 500 kilometers on aver­\n\nage, much greater han other rucks (around 300 kilometers).\n\n1\t\n\nThis Weekly Repor is based on wo recently published projec reports: Julia Pelzeter et al., \n\nBewertung von Technologiekonfigurationen für den Straßengüterverkehr (ifeu, TU Dresden, \n\nDIW Berlin: 20224) (in German; available online.

There appears o be limited poten­\n\ntial for avoiding ranspor and switching o rail freight.4 Thus, \n\nthe focus is on switching from diesel rucks o ba ery-electric \n\nvehicles, which requires an expansion of he fast-charging \n\ninfrastructure. There are also wo hydrogen-based options: \n\nVehicles with hydrogen combustion engines and vehicles \n\nwith fuel cells and an electric motor.

While such systems are already widespread in \n\nChina, hey have no ye been ested much in Germany. Semi-\n\ntrailers with electric axels and heir own ba ery (e-trailer), \n\nwhich could initially be used in combination with diesel rac­\n\ntors, are another possibility.\n\nSome of hese echnologies have been evaluated as advan­\n\ntageous with respec o a few challenging aspects for he \n\nmarke ramp-up of ba ery-electric rucks with fas charg­\n\ning (Figure 7).38 Such challenges include network integra­\n\ntion, he contribution o he stability of he energy system, \n\nand he space requirement. However, here is still no sin­\n\ngle echnology ha equally addresses all of he drawbacks of \n\nba ery-electric rucks. In addition, each ype of echnology \n\nhas its own challenges: An overhead line system, for exam­\n\nple, requires high initial investmen costs for he core net­\n\nwork, and ba ery swapping systems mus be standardized.\n\n36 Julius Jöhrens e al., “Perspektivische Kosten und Klimabilanz von Lkw mi alternativen Antrie­\n\nben 2030,” enERSyn Schwerpunktpapier no. 2 (forthcoming).\n\n37 Julius Jöhrens e al., “Curren echnical findings on he eHighway system from field ests and \n\naccompanying research in Germany,” Working paper compiled by he German cross-projec Work­\n\ning Group on eHighway Technology (AG Technikbewertung) (2022) (available online).\n\n38 Jöhrens e al., Komplementärtechnologien zu BEV-Lkw.\n\nGreenhouse gas reduction quota could create \n\nstrong incentives for hydrogen use\n\nThe greenhouse gas reduction quota (GHG quota) is a \n\nmarket-based climate change mitigation instrumen ha \n\naims o reduce he use of fossil fuels in he ranspor sec­\n\ntor. Companies ha create fossil fuel emissions in rans­\n\npor are required o reduce heir emissions (including fuel \n\nproduction), with he reduction quota increasing each year. \n\nCurrently, he quota is 9.35 percen compared o he fossil \n\nfuel reference value; in 2030, i will rise o 25.1 percent.39 \n\nThere are various options for reducing emissions, such as \n\nusing electric drives or using more electric fuels such as \n\nhydrogen. Companies do no have o mee he quotas hem­\n\nselves, bu can rather rade emissions via certificates.\n\nHowever, he GHG quota does no adequately accoun for he \n\nbe er energy efficiency of ba ery-electric rucks compared o \n\nhydrogen rucks. As a result, higher certificate revenues can \n\nbe achieved by using hydrogen compared o a correspond­\n\ningly lower amoun of electricity ha can cover he same \n\nmileage with a ba ery-electric ruck. If his revenue is used \n\nto subsidize he sale of green hydrogen a refueling stations, \n\nthe price of hydrogen would decline by around wo euros pro \n\nkilogram a he curren GHG quota price of around 70 euros \n\nper on of CO2. If he certificate prices once again rise o he \n\n2022 level of around 400 euros per on due o rising reduc­\n\ntion quotas, green hydrogen could be subsidized o be sold \n\n39 More information is available on he German customs website (in German; available online).\n\nFigure 6\n\nClimate impac of semi-trailer rucks in long-haul ranspor \n\nin 2030\n\nGrams of CO2 equivalen per kilometer\n\n \n\nNote: Considering he entire life cycle.\n\nSource: Julius Jöhrens e al., “Perspektivische Kosten und Klimabilanz von Lkw mi alternativen Antrieben 2030,” \n\nenERSyn Schwerpunktpapier, no. 2 (forthcoming, 2024).\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nCompared o ba ery-electric vehicles, fuel cell vehicles do no cause fewer emissions \n\nover he life cycle even when using green hydrogen.\n\n296\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 47+48/2024\n\nELECTRIC TRUCKS\n\nsugges ha a clear political focus on ba ery-electric rucks \n\nwith stationary ba ery charging is more advantageous.
