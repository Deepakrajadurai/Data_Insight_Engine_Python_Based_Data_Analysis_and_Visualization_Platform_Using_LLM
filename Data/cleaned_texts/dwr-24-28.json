As a classification system, these taxonomies serve \n\nto offer transparency and guidance as to how capital flows \n\ncan be shifted to sustainable and environmentally-friendly \n\nactivities. In this Weekly Report, we analyze 26 sustainable \n\ntaxonomies from countries and regions around the world \n\nusing five criteria. Our study shows that although many tax-\n\nonomies follow a holistic sustainability approach, mandatory \n\ncriteria have often yet to be developed. The share of a country \n\nor region’s emissions that is covered by the taxonomy varies \n\nconsiderably, as the taxonomies follow different approaches \n\nfor determining the activities that are aligned with them. Tax-\n\nonomies often only apply to a limited group of market partici-\n\npants and are rarely linked to mandatory reporting obligations. \n\nThe results emphasize that better coordination between the \n\nexisting taxonomies worldwide is needed and that the criteria \n\nand thresholds for selecting activities in alignment with taxon-\n\nomies should be in accordance with the Paris Agreement. This \n\nway, taxonomies can develop their full potential in guiding the \n\ntransition.\n\nThe EU aims to become climate neutral by 2050 as announced \n\nin the 2019 Green Deal.1 A classification system for sustaina-\n\nble economic activities, known as the EU taxonomy for sus-\n\ntainable activities, plays a crucial role in this transition. The \n\ntaxonomy defines which activities are classified as sustaina-\n\nble for each economic sector.2 The EU Sustainable Finance \n\nAction Plan links the EU taxonomy to further disclosure \n\nrequirements. For example, large capital market-oriented \n\ncompanies3 in the EU have been required to disclose the \n\nshare of their activities that are aligned with the taxonomy \n\nsince the 2022 business year, and other companies will grad-\n\nually follow.4 Banks must also disclose their share of activ-\n\nities aligned with the taxonomy, known as the green asset \n\nratio.5 Financial providers that advertise products with envi-\n\nronmental features must report their taxonomy alignment.6\n\nThis classification system is primarily an instrument for \n\nproviding information and should increase transparency \n\nfor private consumers as well as institutional financial mar-\n\nket actors so that they can invest their capital more sustaina-\n\nbly. This should also enable them to better assess the risk of \n\nstranded assets7 and take these findings into account when \n\nallocating their investments.\n\n1\t\n\nIn Europe alone, investments of up to 350 billion euros per year in low-carbon infrastructure, \n\nsuch as renewable energy plants or electricity grids and storage facilities, will be required by 2030. \n\nCf. Lena Klaaßen und Bjarne Steffen, “Meta-analysis on necessary investment shifts to reach net \n\nzero pathways in Europe,” Nature Climate Change 13 (2023): 58–66 (available online; accessed on \n\nJuly 1, 2024. This applies to all other online sources in this report unless stated otherwise).\n\n2\t Franziska Schütze et al., “EU taxonomy is increasing the transparency of sustainable invest-\n\nments,” DIW Weekly Report no. 51 (2020) (available online).\n\n3\t The first step will affect all companies that are already required to report under the Non-finan-\n\ncial Reporting Directive (NFRD). This includes capital market-oriented companies with more than \n\n500 employees.\n\n4\t As a part of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD EU Regulation 2022/2464 \n\n(available online)), the group of companies obligated to report will expand by non-capital mar-\n\nket-oriented companies with over 250 employees or sales revenue greater than 50 million euros or \n\na balance sheet total of over 24 million euros.\n\n5\t In accordance with Article 8 of the EU Taxonomy Regulation, cf. European Union, Regulation \n\n(EU) 2020/852 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 June 2020 on the establish-\n\nment of a framework to facilitate sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 \n\n(2020) (available online).\n\n6\t As part of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), see European Commission, \n\nSustainability-related disclosure in the financial services sector (2024) (available online).\n\n7\t Stranded assets are investments or assets that can no longer be used and which thus become \n\nunprofitable. For example, investments in a coal-fired power plant that can no longer be operated \n\ndue to climate policy measures can massively lose value.\n\n191\n\nDIW Weekly Report 28/2024\n\nSustainable finance taxonomies\n\nBox 1\n\nTaxonomy development and terminology\n\nA sustainable finance taxonomy1 (referred to here as a “taxonomy”) \n\nclassifies sustainable activities and investments. The emergence \n\nof such taxonomies in various countries, regions, and international \n\norganizations was driven in particular by the Paris Agreement and \n\nthe UN Sustainable Development Goals. However, the names of \n\nthe taxonomies vary, including the words “sustainable,” “green,” \n\n“climate,” “transition,” and “social” in their titles, indicating different \n\ntypes of taxonomies. Sustainable taxonomies are by definition the \n\nmost comprehensive, as the term “sustainable” has an ecological, \n\neconomic, and social dimension.2 Thus, a green taxonomy focuses \n\non pure green activities or those that positively contribute to the \n\n1\t\n\nIn this Weekly Report, we use the general term “sustainable finance taxonomy” unless the tax-\n\nonomy is classified specifically as a green finance taxonomy.\n\n2\t Bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung, Nachhaltigkeit (in \n\nGerman; available online).\n\nenvironmental goals covered by the taxonomy. However, the gran-\n\nularity, scope, criteria, and environmental objectives of the taxon-\n\nomies can differ broadly. Social taxonomies focus mainly on the \n\npositive contribution to social objectives, such as decent work and \n\nadequate living standards.3 In contrast, transition taxonomies take \n\na more dynamic approach, as they identify activities that are not \n\ncurrently in accordance with the Paris Agreement and have a lack \n\nof suitable “green” alternatives. If a taxonomy exclusively promotes \n\ngreen activities, it excludes important parts of the economy that \n\nstill need to be transformed. A green or sustainable taxonomy can \n\nalso contain elements of transition activities.\n\n3\t EU Platform on Sustainable Finance, Report on Social Taxonomy.

The higher the score, the higher \n\nthe transition potential.\n\nBox 2\n\nCriteria for estimating the transition potential of \n\ntaxonomies\n\nThe transition to climate neutrality is different in every country \n\ndue to individual circumstances. A “transition score” (TS) has \n\nbeen developed as an objective scoring system to enable a \n\ncomparable assessment of transformation potential. This score \n\nconsists of five criteria that summarize the data on the taxono-\n\nmies in a structured manner:1 policy embeddedness, sectoral \n\ncoverage, screening approach, target group, and reporting \n\nand disclosure (Table 1).\n\nThere are four stages of fulfillment for each criterion with \n\nassigned scores, here indicated in brackets:2 no contribution \n\n[1], little contribution [2]; moderate contribution [3]; or high \n\ncontribution [4].\n\n1\t\n\nFor a more detailed description of the criteria and scoring, cf. Marchewitz et al., “Sustain-\n\nable Finance Taxonomies.”\n\n2\t The criteria were weighted equally, as all five criteria are necessary for the econom-\n\nic transition. A different weighting was also applied in the publication this Weekly Report is \n\nbased on, but this did not fundamentally change the ranking.\n\nTable 1\n\nAnalysis criteria for measuring a taxonomy’s \n\npotential contribution to the economic transition\n\nCriterion\n\nDefinition\n\nPolicy embeddedness \n\nThis criterion captures whether a taxonomy refers to the climate \n\ntargets in international frameworks such as the Paris Agreement \n\nand the SDGs as well as national or regional climate targets. It \n\nalso assesses whether it includes more comprehensive sustain-\n\nability goals \n\nSectoral coverage\n\nThis criterion refers to the share of emissions explicitly ­covered \n\nin a taxonomy, i.e., the sectors or technologies explicitly men-\n\ntioned in the respective taxonomy framework.1\n\nScreening approach\n\nThis criterion captures whether taxonomies define (technical) \n\nselection criteria or thresholds for including economic activities \n\nand whether these follow a credible, science-based decarboni-\n\nzation pathway. \n\nTarget group\n\nThis criterion refers to which market players in the financial \n\nsector and the real economy and which financial instruments  \n\n(e. g. bonds, loans, guarantees, funds) are affected by the \n\n­taxonomy.\n\nReporting and \n\n­disclosure \n\nThis criterion assesses whether a taxonomy is linked to reporting \n\nobligations for countries in the respective country.\n\n1  We used the World Emissions Clock (WEC) to evaluate the percentual coverage of the \n\ncountry-specific greenhouse gas emissions per sector (available online).\n\nSource: Authors’ depiction.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\n193\n\nDIW Weekly Report 28/2024\n\nSustainable finance taxonomies\n\nwind energy, must be supported.9 A taxonomy that supports \n\nboth can offer companies in these sectors better access to \n\nfinancing options. Building upon this classification system, \n\nthis Weekly Report investigates the potential of the taxono-\n\nmies developed worldwide to support the transition to a cli-\n\nmate-neutral economy.10\n\nMany taxonomies are not suitable for supporting \n\nthe transition\n\nWe used five criteria to analyze official documents of the 26 \n\ntaxonomies already published and built a transition score \n\n(TS). The higher the TS, the higher the transition potential. \n\nThe TS makes it possible to compare the taxonomies (Box 2), \n\nand the results of the comparison reveal a scattered picture \n\n(Figure 2).11 The TS ranges from 2.0 to 3.6 points with an aver-\n\nage score of 2.8. The taxonomies with the highest TS (three \n\nor more points, so a “moderate to high contribution”) are \n\nfrom the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), \n\nColumbia, EU, Georgia, Singapore, South Korea, and Sri \n\nLanka. The taxonomies with the lowest scores (between two \n\nand 2.4 points, “little contribution”) are from Israel, Malaysia, \n\nRussia, South Africa, and Uzbekistan.\n\nMany taxonomies strive for a holistic sustainability \n\napproach\n\nIn terms of policy embeddedness, i.e., how the taxonomy \n\nrefers to the goals in international frameworks such as the \n\nParis Agreement, the analysis paints a predominantly posi-\n\ntive picture (Figure 3). Eighteen of the 26 taxonomies received \n\nall four points for this criterion, while seven received three \n\npoints and Uzbekistan’s taxonomy two points. Some taxon-\n\nomies also refer specifically to the nationally determined \n\ncontributions (NDCs).12 In addition, the taxonomies fre-\n\nquently mention the Paris Agreement targets, the Sustainable \n\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs), and the respective country’s \n\nnational climate and energy policies. Several taxonomies aim \n\nto extend their scope to a broader range of environmental \n\nobjectives, such as biodiversity and the transition to a circu-\n\nlar economy. Thirteen taxonomies, including the Columbian, \n\nMongolian, Russian, South African, and Rwandan taxono-\n\nmies, include nature-related aspects or plan to do so. Others \n\nconsider specific regional aspects, such as the Islamic finan-\n\ncial system in Malaysia. Countries such as Georgia, Mongolia, \n\nand Mexico have already included social aspects, while coun-\n\ntries such as Brazil plan to include them. This indicates that \n\nmany taxonomies follow a holistic sustainability approach, \n\n9\t Mritiunjoy Mohanty and Runa Sarkar, The Role of Coal in a Sustainable Energy Mix for India \n\n(Routledge: 2024) (available online).\n\n10\t Catherine Marchewitz et al., “Sustainable Finance Taxonomies – Enabling the Transition to-\n\nwards Net Zero?

Explicitly covered means that criteria and thresh-\n\nold values have been developed for these economic activi-\n\nties. Six taxonomies cover less than 50 percent of emissions,14 \n\nwhile ten others cover more than 90 percent of emissions.15 \n\n13\t Some of the taxonomies do not yet cover all sectors because they are still in development.\n\n14\t These values are preliminary: For example, Hong Kong and Thailand have announced that \n\nthey want to include more sectors in the next revisions, as previously only drafts have been pub-\n\nlished.\n\n15\t Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Brazil, China, Columbia, South Korea, LAC, \n\nMongolia, Philippines, Singapore.

Data source for emissions: World Emissions Clock.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nThe share of emissions in the economic sectors explicitly covered in the taxonomies \n\nvaries considerably.\n\nBox 3\n\nApproaches for screening economic activities in \n\nalignment with the taxonomy\n\nGenerally, three approaches are used to classify economic \n\nactivities as aligned with a taxonomy. These approaches par-\n\ntially overlap and are independently used or used together in \n\ncombination (G20 SFWG, 2022). One approach involves tech-\n\nnical screening criteria (TSC design), which is used by many \n\ntaxonomies, including the EU taxonomy.1 According to the TSC \n\ndesign, an economic activity is aligned with the taxonomy if its \n\nexpected contribution to an environmental objective defined \n\nin the taxonomy meets a series of criteria and threshold values \n\nfor emission intensity. As the type of technology underlying an \n\nactivity is not restricted, the TSC design is technology neutral. \n\nIn contrast, the whitelist design (WL) used in the taxonomies \n\nof Bangladesh, China, Georgia, Russia, and Mongolia explicitly \n\nmentions the activities aligned with the taxonomy and is thus \n\ntechnology specific. A “whitelist” means that an activity is only \n\nin alignment if it (i) is specifically listed in the taxonomy and \n\n(ii) it meets the relevant national environmental performance \n\nstandards. Finally, some taxonomies follow a principles-based \n\napproach. This approach defines a set of core principles and \n\nis open to the type of technology used, such as in the ASEAN, \n\nMalaysian, Filipino, and Singaporean taxonomies. Most tax-\n\nonomies combine their chosen approach with additional \n\nscreening criteria, such as social minimum safeguards and/\n\nor the “Do No Significant Harm” principle as well as specific \n\nexclusion criteria.\n\n1\t\n\nFor example, EU, Colombia, South Korea, South Africa, Indonesia and Vietnam, as well as \n\npartially Uzbekistan.\n\n195\n\nDIW Weekly Report 28/2024\n\nSustainable finance taxonomies\n\nat least include mandatory obligations for a defined list of \n\nactors and products. The rest of the taxonomies only received \n\ntwo points each, as they either only define a limited target \n\ngroup or set out a voluntary specification. Furthermore, in \n\nsome cases, such as Bangladesh, China, Kazakhstan, Russia, \n\nand Vietnam, the taxonomy only applies to specific financial \n\ninstruments, such as green bonds.17\n\nTaxonomies rarely linked to reporting obligations\n\nMany taxonomies have not been directly linked to manda-\n\ntory disclosure and reporting obligations (Figure 7). In most \n\ncases, companies are not required to disclose information or \n\nto report about their alignment with the taxonomy. As taxon-\n\nomies are often voluntary frameworks, they are not linked to \n\nreporting obligations, even if some taxonomies refer to exist-\n\ning international standards and frameworks.18 The taxono-\n\nmies of Bangladesh, China, Georgia, and the EU are some \n\nof the few that have mandatory regulations. All market par-\n\nticipants who belong to the taxonomies’ target group must \n\ndisclose information and report about their taxonomy-re-\n\nlated activities.\n\nThresholds help decarbonize activities in \n\nemission-intensive sectors\n\nMost taxonomies classify not only economic activities that \n\nare already carbon neutral (such as solar and wind energy, \n\nelectric vehicles, or similar) as sustainable, but also some \n\nactivities in emission-intensive sectors. In these sectors, \n\nthe exact criteria and thresholds are decisive for the ques-\n\ntion of to what extent they can potentially contribute to a cli-\n\nmate-neutral economy. However, the thresholds are not reg-\n\nularly adjusted or are not dynamic in many taxonomies. This \n\ncan mean that corresponding investments are not in accord-\n\nance with the Paris Agreement or lead to stranded assets. To \n\nillustrate the importance of dynamic thresholds, the crite-\n\nria and thresholds for the energy and transportation sectors \n\nused in the taxonomies of the EU, Thailand, and Indonesia \n\nare compared below (Table 2).\n\nThe path to carbon neutrality in the energy sector as well as \n\nin most industrial sectors has not yet been defined in the EU \n\ntaxonomy. For example, a binary threshold was determined \n\nfor the CO2 intensity of electricity generation (for example for \n\nelectricity from hydropower plants, biomass, heat cogenera-\n\ntion, or gas-fired power plants). The taxonomy in Thailand, in \n\ncontrast, has a traffic light system and contains two thresh-\n\nolds for the energy sector that decrease over time. The traf-\n\nfic light system in the Indonesian taxonomy is also based on \n\n17\t While bonds continue to be an important component of project financing, other financial prod-\n\nucts such as loans, funds, insurance products, and blended financing also play an important role. \n\nIn many cases, loans remain the predominant form of project financing, which is indicative of the \n\ndiversity and complexity of the financial landscape. Cf. Frédéric Holm-Hadulla et al., “Firm debt \n\nfinancing structures and the transmission of shocks in the euro area,” Economic Bulletin Articles 4 \n\n(2022) (available online).\n\n18\t The study only examined whether the taxonomy refers to disclosure and reporting obliga-\n\ntions. It did not examine whether there are reporting obligations in the respective country that in \n\nturn refer to the taxonomy.\n\ninternational benchmarks in the strictest category but does \n\nnot require any threshold reductions.19\n\nIn the transport sector, the EU taxonomy defines a dynamic \n\nthreshold for passenger and light commercial vehicles that \n\ndeclines over the years. In the Thai taxonomy, however, there \n\nis already a threshold of zero emissions for passenger and \n\nlight commercial vehicles.\n\nThe examples illustrate that different countries and regions \n\nadjust thresholds differently, which can affect the speed of \n\nthe transition.\n\nConclusion: Global standards for taxonomies are \n\nessential\n\nTaxonomies are important for defining sustainable activi-\n\nties and thus for financing the transition to a climate-neu-\n\ntral economy. With clear criteria and standards, taxonomies \n\ncan contribute to creating a robust market for investments \n\nin climate-friendly activities.\n\n19\t The ASEAN Taxonomy traffic light system contains similar thresholds for the energy sector: \n\nFor “green” (level 1), the threshold is below 100 g CO2e/kWh. The “yellow” category is divided into \n\n“level 2” and “level 3” with the thresholds of 100 to 425 and 425 to 520 g of CO2e/kWh.\n\nFigure 5\n\nScreening approach for taxonomy-aligned economic activities\n\nNo criteria \n\nor thresholds\n\nUZ\n\nThresholds and/or \n\ncriteria, unclear \n\nmeasurability, \n\nscientiﬁc basis is \n\nopaque \n\nDynamic thresholds \n\nand clear screening \n\ncriteria, science-based \n\norigin is unclear\n\nDynamic, \n\nmeasurable \n\nthresholds/criteria \n\nthat are science \n\nbased\n\nRU\n\nRW\n\nZA\n\nJP\n\nVN\n\nBD\n\nBR\n\nTH\n\nCO\n\nEU\n\nGE\n\nKZ\n\nID\n\nHK\n\nLK\n\nKR\n\nSG\n\nMY\n\nMX\n\nMN\n\nPH\n\nIL\n\nCN\n\nHigh\n\ncontri-\n\nbution\n\nLittle\n\ncontri-\n\nbution\n\nModerate \n\ncontri-\n\nbution\n\nNo\n\ncontri-\n\nbution\n\nLAC\n\nAS\n\nSource: Authors’ depiction.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nThe screening approaches for selecting economic activities in alignment with the \n\ntaxonomy differ considerably.\n\n196\n\nDIW Weekly Report 28/2024\n\nSustainable finance taxonomies\n\nIn conclusion, we find that the potential of the taxonomies \n\nanalyzed here to shift capital flows in accordance with the \n\nParis Agreement has not yet been exhausted. To realize the \n\nfull potential of taxonomies, they should contain environ-\n\nmental and social standards that are scientifically sound and \n\nprovide a clear path to climate neutrality. Moreover, an adjust-\n\nment to international climate targets for all sectors must be \n\nensured. This requires a dynamic approach, meaning the \n\ntaxonomy must continually be revised and adjusted based \n\non new scientific findings. In addition, a taxonomy should \n\nbe applied to all relevant financial instruments and actors \n\nin the financial sector and in the real economy and be a part \n\nof corporate reporting.\n\nDespite efforts to achieve international harmonization, there \n\nare major differences and divergent definitions of what is \n\n“green” or “sustainable” around the world. Many firms and \n\ninvestors are active in multiple countries. To increase the \n\neffectiveness of the taxonomies and to avoid shifting emis-\n\nsions abroad (carbon leakage), taxonomies should be har-\n\nmonized at the international level.\n\nTaxonomies worldwide should be better coordinated so that \n\nsustainability policies and programs across countries and \n\nregions can be evaluated coherently and carbon leakage and \n\ncapital market fragmentation can be avoided.20\n\n20\t WWF and Climate & Company, When Finance talks Nature, WWF France in cooperation with Cli-\n\nmate & Company (2022) (available online).\n\nFigure 6\n\nTaxonomy target group\n\nUZ\n\nRU\n\nRW\n\nZA\n\nJP\n\nVN\n\nBD\n\nBR\n\nTH\n\nCO\n\nEU\n\nGE\n\nKZ\n\nID\n\nHK\n\nLK\n\nKR\n\nSG\n\nMY\n\nMX\n\nMN\n\nPH\n\nIL\n\nCN\n\nMandatory obligations for a few market \n\nparticipants or voluntary speciﬁcation \n\nfor potential users\n\nMandatory obligations for a moderate \n\nnumber of market participants or \n\nproducts\n\nMandatory obligations for most or all \n\nrelevant market participants\n\nHigh\n\ncontri-\n\nbution\n\nLittle\n\ncontri-\n\nbution\n\nModerate \n\ncontri-\n\nbution\n\n§\n\n§\n\nNo\n\ncontri-\n\nbution\n\nAS\n\nLAC\n\nNo information on target group.\n\nSource: Authors’ depiction.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nTaxonomies often only apply to a limited group of market participants and financial \n\nproducts.\n\nFigure 7\n\nTaxonomy disclosure and reporting obligations \n\nUZ\n\nRU\n\nRW\n\nZA\n\nJP\n\nVN\n\nBD\n\nBR\n\nTH\n\nCO\n\nEU\n\nGE\n\nKZ\n\nID\n\nHK\n\nLK\n\nKR\n\nSG\n\nMY\n\nMX\n\nMN\n\nPH\n\nIL\n\nCN\n\nDisclosure voluntary and \n\nrecommended, frameworks \n\ncontain detailed speciﬁcations\n\nGranular data on taxonomy-alignment needs to be disclosed\n\nGranular data on taxonomy-alignment \n\nneeds to be disclosed and audited by \n\nan independent third party\n\nHigh\n\ncontri-\n\nbution\n\nLittle\n\ncontri-\n\nbution\n\nModerate \n\ncontri-\n\nbution\n\n§\n\nNo\n\ncontri-\n\nbution\n\nLAC\n\nAS\n\n§\n\nNo disclosure or reporting obligations\n\nSource: Authors’ depiction.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nTaxonomies are rarely linked to disclosure and reporting obligations.\n\nTable 2\n\nThreshold examples in the energy and transport sectors \n\nfor the EU, Thailand, and Indonesia \n\nEU\n\nThailand \n\nIndonesia\n\nEnergy sector*\n\nThreshold for green:  \n\n< 100 gCO2e/kWh, \n\n­previously no reduction \n\npath\n\nThreshold for green in \n\ntraffic light system:\n\n< 100 gCO2e/kWh\n\nReduction to  \n\n< 50 gCO2e/kWh by 2040\n\nThreshold for green in \n\ntraffic light system:\n\n< 100 gCO2e/KWh\n\nNo traffic light system, \n\nhence no yellow category\n\nYellow in traffic light \n\nsystem:  \n\nwill be reduced from < 382 \n\nto < 148 gCO2e/kWh in five-\n\nyear steps to zero by 2040\n\nYellow in traffic light system: \n\n< 510 gCO2/KWh (based \n\non the IEA Sustainable \n\n­Development Scenario \n\n(SDS))\n\nTransportation \n\n(Passenger \n\nvehicles and \n\nlight commercial \n\nvehicles)\n\nThreshold:  \n\n< 50 g CO2 pro kilometer \n\ndriven (g CO2/km)  \n\nEmissions must be reduced \n\nto zero by 2026\n\nNo transition period \n\n(­meaning threshold is  \n\nzero emissions)\n\nNot explicitly contained in \n\nthe taxonomy/thresholds \n\nhave not yet been defined\n\nNotes: * (Life cycle emissions in electricity generation). gCO2e/kWh = grams of CO2 equivalent per \n\nkilowatt hour.\n\nSources: Authors’ depiction; EU, Thai, and Indonesian taxonomies.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\n197\n\nDIW Weekly Report 28/2024\n\nSustainable finance taxonomies\n\nJEL: G18, P00, Q01, Q58\n\nKeywords: Sustainable Finance Taxonomy, Green Finance, Transition Finance, \n\nEU Taxonomy, climate policy, transition plans\n\nCatherine Marchewitz is a Research Associate in the Climate Policy \n\nDepartment at DIW Berlin | cmarchewitz@diw.de\n\nFranziska Schütze is a Research Associate in the Climate Policy Department \n\nat DIW Berlin | fschuetze@diw.de\n\nFernanda Ballesteros is a Ph.D. Student in the Climate Policy Department at \n\nDIW Berlin | fballesteros@diw.de",

As a classification system, hese axonomies serve \n\nto offer ransparency and guidance as o how capital flows \n\ncan be shifted o sustainable and environmentally-friendly \n\nactivities. In his Weekly Report, we analyze 26 sustainable \n\ntaxonomies from countries and regions around he world \n\nusing five criteria. Our study shows ha although many ax-\n\nonomies follow a holistic sustainability approach, mandatory \n\ncriteria have often ye o be developed. The share of a country \n\nor region’s emissions ha is covered by he axonomy varies \n\nconsiderably, as he axonomies follow differen approaches \n\nfor determining he activities ha are aligned with hem. Tax-\n\nonomies often only apply o a limited group of marke partici-\n\npants and are rarely linked o mandatory reporting obligations. \n\nThe results emphasize ha be er coordination between he \n\nexisting axonomies worldwide is needed and ha he criteria \n\nand hresholds for selecting activities in alignmen with axon-\n\nomies should be in accordance with he Paris Agreement. This \n\nway, axonomies can develop heir full potential in guiding he \n\ntransition.\n\nThe EU aims o become climate neutral by 2050 as announced \n\nin he 2019 Green Deal.1 A classification system for sustaina-\n\nble economic activities, known as he EU axonomy for sus-\n\ntainable activities, plays a crucial role in his ransition. The \n\ntaxonomy defines which activities are classified as sustaina-\n\nble for each economic sector.2 The EU Sustainable Finance \n\nAction Plan links he EU axonomy o further disclosure \n\nrequirements. For example, large capital market-oriented \n\ncompanies3 in he EU have been required o disclose he \n\nshare of heir activities ha are aligned with he axonomy \n\nsince he 2022 business year, and other companies will grad-\n\nually follow.4 Banks mus also disclose heir share of activ-\n\nities aligned with he axonomy, known as he green asse \n\nratio.5 Financial providers ha advertise products with envi-\n\nronmental features mus repor heir axonomy alignment.6\n\nThis classification system is primarily an instrumen for \n\nproviding information and should increase ransparency \n\nfor private consumers as well as institutional financial mar-\n\nke actors so ha hey can inves heir capital more sustaina-\n\nbly. This should also enable hem o be er assess he risk of \n\nstranded assets7 and ake hese findings into accoun when \n\nallocating heir investments.\n\n1\t\n\nIn Europe alone, investments of up o 350 billion euros per year in low-carbon infrastructure, \n\nsuch as renewable energy plants or electricity grids and storage facilities, will be required by 2030. \n\nCf. Lena Klaaßen und Bjarne Steffen, “Meta-analysis on necessary investmen shifts o reach ne \n\nzero pathways in Europe,” Nature Climate Change 13 (2023): 58–66 (available online; accessed on \n\nJuly 1, 2024.

This includes capital market-oriented companies with more han \n\n500 employees.\n\n4\t As a par of he Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD EU Regulation 2022/2464 \n\n(available online)), he group of companies obligated o repor will expand by non-capital mar-\n\nket-oriented companies with over 250 employees or sales revenue greater han 50 million euros or \n\na balance shee otal of over 24 million euros.\n\n5\t In accordance with Article 8 of he EU Taxonomy Regulation, cf. European Union, Regulation \n\n(EU) 2020/852 of he European Parliamen and of he Council of 18 June 2020 on he establish-\n\nmen of a framework o facilitate sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 \n\n(2020) (available online).\n\n6\t As par of he Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), see European Commission, \n\nSustainability-related disclosure in he financial services sector (2024) (available online).\n\n7\t Stranded assets are investments or assets ha can no longer be used and which hus become \n\nunprofitable. For example, investments in a coal-fired power plan ha can no longer be operated \n\ndue o climate policy measures can massively lose value.\n\n191\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 28/2024\n\nSustainable finance axonomies\n\nBox 1\n\nTaxonomy developmen and erminology\n\nA sustainable finance axonomy1 (referred o here as a “taxonomy”) \n\nclassifies sustainable activities and investments. The emergence \n\nof such axonomies in various countries, regions, and international \n\norganizations was driven in particular by he Paris Agreemen and \n\nthe UN Sustainable Developmen Goals. However, he names of \n\nthe axonomies vary, including he words “sustainable,” “green,” \n\n“climate,” “transition,” and “social” in heir itles, indicating differen \n\ntypes of axonomies. Sustainable axonomies are by definition he \n\nmos comprehensive, as he erm “sustainable” has an ecological, \n\neconomic, and social dimension.2 Thus, a green axonomy focuses \n\non pure green activities or hose ha positively contribute o he \n\n1\t\n\nIn his Weekly Report, we use he general erm “sustainable finance axonomy” unless he ax-\n\nonomy is classified specifically as a green finance axonomy.\n\n2\t Bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbei und Entwicklung, Nachhaltigkei (in \n\nGerman; available online).\n\nenvironmental goals covered by he axonomy.

The axonomies with he lowes scores (between wo \n\nand 2.4 points, “li le contribution”) are from Israel, Malaysia, \n\nRussia, South Africa, and Uzbekistan.\n\nMany axonomies strive for a holistic sustainability \n\napproach\n\nIn erms of policy embeddedness, i.e., how he axonomy \n\nrefers o he goals in international frameworks such as he \n\nParis Agreement, he analysis paints a predominantly posi-\n\ntive picture (Figure 3). Eighteen of he 26 axonomies received \n\nall four points for his criterion, while seven received hree \n\npoints and Uzbekistan’s axonomy wo points. Some axon-\n\nomies also refer specifically o he nationally determined \n\ncontributions (NDCs).12 In addition, he axonomies fre-\n\nquently mention he Paris Agreemen argets, he Sustainable \n\nDevelopmen Goals (SDGs), and he respective country’s \n\nnational climate and energy policies. Several axonomies aim \n\nto extend heir scope o a broader range of environmental \n\nobjectives, such as biodiversity and he ransition o a circu-\n\nlar economy. Thirteen axonomies, including he Columbian, \n\nMongolian, Russian, South African, and Rwandan axono-\n\nmies, include nature-related aspects or plan o do so. Others \n\nconsider specific regional aspects, such as he Islamic finan-\n\ncial system in Malaysia.

Data source for emissions: World Emissions Clock.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nThe share of emissions in he economic sectors explicitly covered in he axonomies \n\nvaries considerably.\n\nBox 3\n\nApproaches for screening economic activities in \n\nalignmen with he axonomy\n\nGenerally, hree approaches are used o classify economic \n\nactivities as aligned with a axonomy. These approaches par-\n\ntially overlap and are independently used or used ogether in \n\ncombination (G20 SFWG, 2022). One approach involves ech-\n\nnical screening criteria (TSC design), which is used by many \n\ntaxonomies, including he EU axonomy.1 According o he TSC \n\ndesign, an economic activity is aligned with he axonomy if its \n\nexpected contribution o an environmental objective defined \n\nin he axonomy meets a series of criteria and hreshold values \n\nfor emission intensity. As he ype of echnology underlying an \n\nactivity is no restricted, he TSC design is echnology neutral. \n\nIn contrast, he whitelis design (WL) used in he axonomies \n\nof Bangladesh, China, Georgia, Russia, and Mongolia explicitly \n\nmentions he activities aligned with he axonomy and is hus \n\ntechnology specific. A “whitelist” means ha an activity is only \n\nin alignmen if i (i) is specifically listed in he axonomy and \n\n(ii) i meets he relevan national environmental performance \n\nstandards. Finally, some axonomies follow a principles-based \n\napproach. This approach defines a se of core principles and \n\nis open o he ype of echnology used, such as in he ASEAN, \n\nMalaysian, Filipino, and Singaporean axonomies. Mos ax-\n\nonomies combine heir chosen approach with additional \n\nscreening criteria, such as social minimum safeguards and/\n\nor he “Do No Significan Harm” principle as well as specific \n\nexclusion criteria.\n\n1\t\n\nFor example, EU, Colombia, South Korea, South Africa, Indonesia and Vietnam, as well as \n\npartially Uzbekistan.\n\n195\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 28/2024\n\nSustainable finance axonomies\n\na leas include mandatory obligations for a defined lis of \n\nactors and products. The res of he axonomies only received \n\ntwo points each, as hey either only define a limited arge \n\ngroup or se ou a voluntary specification. Furthermore, in \n\nsome cases, such as Bangladesh, China, Kazakhstan, Russia, \n\nand Vietnam, he axonomy only applies o specific financial \n\ninstruments, such as green bonds.17\n\nTaxonomies rarely linked o reporting obligations\n\nMany axonomies have no been directly linked o manda-\n\ntory disclosure and reporting obligations (Figure 7). In mos \n\ncases, companies are no required o disclose information or \n\nto repor abou heir alignmen with he axonomy. As axon-\n\nomies are often voluntary frameworks, hey are no linked o \n\nreporting obligations, even if some axonomies refer o exist-\n\ning international standards and frameworks.18 The axono-\n\nmies of Bangladesh, China, Georgia, and he EU are some \n\nof he few ha have mandatory regulations. All marke par-\n\nticipants who belong o he axonomies’ arge group mus \n\ndisclose information and repor abou heir axonomy-re-\n\nlated activities.\n\nThresholds help decarbonize activities in \n\nemission-intensive sectors\n\nMos axonomies classify no only economic activities ha \n\nare already carbon neutral (such as solar and wind energy, \n\nelectric vehicles, or similar) as sustainable, bu also some \n\nactivities in emission-intensive sectors. In hese sectors, \n\nthe exac criteria and hresholds are decisive for he ques-\n\ntion of o wha exten hey can potentially contribute o a cli-\n\nmate-neutral economy. However, he hresholds are no reg-\n\nularly adjusted or are no dynamic in many axonomies. This \n\ncan mean ha corresponding investments are no in accord-\n\nance with he Paris Agreemen or lead o stranded assets. To \n\nillustrate he importance of dynamic hresholds, he crite-\n\nria and hresholds for he energy and ransportation sectors \n\nused in he axonomies of he EU, Thailand, and Indonesia \n\nare compared below (Table 2).\n\nThe path o carbon neutrality in he energy sector as well as \n\nin mos industrial sectors has no ye been defined in he EU \n\ntaxonomy. For example, a binary hreshold was determined \n\nfor he CO2 intensity of electricity generation (for example for \n\nelectricity from hydropower plants, biomass, hea cogenera-\n\ntion, or gas-fired power plants). The axonomy in Thailand, in \n\ncontrast, has a raffic ligh system and contains wo hresh-\n\nolds for he energy sector ha decrease over ime. The raf-\n\nfic ligh system in he Indonesian axonomy is also based on \n\n17\t While bonds continue o be an importan componen of projec financing, other financial prod-\n\nucts such as loans, funds, insurance products, and blended financing also play an importan role. \n\nIn many cases, loans remain he predominan form of projec financing, which is indicative of he \n\ndiversity and complexity of he financial landscape. Cf. Frédéric Holm-Hadulla et al., “Firm deb \n\nfinancing structures and he ransmission of shocks in he euro area,” Economic Bulletin Articles 4 \n\n(2022) (available online).\n\n18\t The study only examined whether he axonomy refers o disclosure and reporting obliga-\n\ntions. I did no examine whether here are reporting obligations in he respective country ha in \n\nturn refer o he axonomy.\n\ninternational benchmarks in he strictes category bu does \n\nno require any hreshold reductions.19\n\nIn he ranspor sector, he EU axonomy defines a dynamic \n\nthreshold for passenger and ligh commercial vehicles ha \n\ndeclines over he years. In he Thai axonomy, however, here \n\nis already a hreshold of zero emissions for passenger and \n\nligh commercial vehicles.\n\nThe examples illustrate ha differen countries and regions \n\nadjus hresholds differently, which can affec he speed of \n\nthe ransition.\n\nConclusion: Global standards for axonomies are \n\nessential\n\nTaxonomies are importan for defining sustainable activi-\n\nties and hus for financing he ransition o a climate-neu-\n\ntral economy. With clear criteria and standards, axonomies \n\ncan contribute o creating a robus marke for investments \n\nin climate-friendly activities.\n\n19\t The ASEAN Taxonomy raffic ligh system contains similar hresholds for he energy sector: \n\nFor “green” (level 1), he hreshold is below 100 g CO2e/kWh. The “yellow” category is divided into \n\n“level 2” and “level 3” with he hresholds of 100 o 425 and 425 o 520 g of CO2e/kWh.\n\nFigure 5\n\nScreening approach for axonomy-aligned economic activities\n\nNo criteria \n\nor hresholds\n\nUZ\n\nThresholds and/or \n\ncriteria, unclear \n\nmeasurability, \n\nscientiﬁc basis is \n\nopaque \n\nDynamic hresholds \n\nand clear screening \n\ncriteria, science-based \n\norigin is unclear\n\nDynamic, \n\nmeasurable \n\nthresholds/criteria \n\ntha are science \n\nbased\n\nRU\n\nRW\n\nZA\n\nJP\n\nVN\n\nBD\n\nBR\n\nTH\n\nCO\n\nEU\n\nGE\n\nKZ\n\nID\n\nHK\n\nLK\n\nKR\n\nSG\n\nMY\n\nMX\n\nMN\n\nPH\n\nIL\n\nCN\n\nHigh\n\ncontri-\n\nbution\n\nLi le\n\ncontri-\n\nbution\n\nModerate \n\ncontri-\n\nbution\n\nNo\n\ncontri-\n\nbution\n\nLAC\n\nAS\n\nSource: Authors’ depiction.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nThe screening approaches for selecting economic activities in alignmen with he \n\ntaxonomy differ considerably.\n\n196\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 28/2024\n\nSustainable finance axonomies\n\nIn conclusion, we find ha he potential of he axonomies \n\nanalyzed here o shif capital flows in accordance with he \n\nParis Agreemen has no ye been exhausted.

In addition, a axonomy should \n\nbe applied o all relevan financial instruments and actors \n\nin he financial sector and in he real economy and be a par \n\nof corporate reporting.\n\nDespite efforts o achieve international harmonization, here \n\nare major differences and divergen definitions of wha is \n\n“green” or “sustainable” around he world.

To increase he \n\neffectiveness of he axonomies and o avoid shifting emis-\n\nsions abroad (carbon leakage), axonomies should be har-\n\nmonized a he international level.\n\nTaxonomies worldwide should be be er coordinated so ha \n\nsustainability policies and programs across countries and \n\nregions can be evaluated coherently and carbon leakage and \n\ncapital marke fragmentation can be avoided.20\n\n20\t WWF and Climate & Company, When Finance alks Nature, WWF France in cooperation with Cli-\n\nmate & Company (2022) (available online).\n\nFigure 6\n\nTaxonomy arge group\n\nUZ\n\nRU\n\nRW\n\nZA\n\nJP\n\nVN\n\nBD\n\nBR\n\nTH\n\nCO\n\nEU\n\nGE\n\nKZ\n\nID\n\nHK\n\nLK\n\nKR\n\nSG\n\nMY\n\nMX\n\nMN\n\nPH\n\nIL\n\nCN\n\nMandatory obligations for a few marke \n\nparticipants or voluntary speciﬁcation \n\nfor potential users\n\nMandatory obligations for a moderate \n\nnumber of marke participants or \n\nproducts\n\nMandatory obligations for mos or all \n\nrelevan marke participants\n\nHigh\n\ncontri-\n\nbution\n\nLi le\n\ncontri-\n\nbution\n\nModerate \n\ncontri-\n\nbution\n\n§\n\n§\n\nNo\n\ncontri-\n\nbution\n\nAS\n\nLAC\n\nNo information on arge group.\n\nSource: Authors’ depiction.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nTaxonomies often only apply o a limited group of marke participants and financial \n\nproducts.\n\nFigure 7\n\nTaxonomy disclosure and reporting obligations \n\nUZ\n\nRU\n\nRW\n\nZA\n\nJP\n\nVN\n\nBD\n\nBR\n\nTH\n\nCO\n\nEU\n\nGE\n\nKZ\n\nID\n\nHK\n\nLK\n\nKR\n\nSG\n\nMY\n\nMX\n\nMN\n\nPH\n\nIL\n\nCN\n\nDisclosure voluntary and \n\nrecommended, frameworks \n\ncontain detailed speciﬁcations\n\nGranular data on axonomy-alignmen needs o be disclosed\n\nGranular data on axonomy-alignmen \n\nneeds o be disclosed and audited by \n\nan independen hird party\n\nHigh\n\ncontri-\n\nbution\n\nLi le\n\ncontri-\n\nbution\n\nModerate \n\ncontri-\n\nbution\n\n§\n\nNo\n\ncontri-\n\nbution\n\nLAC\n\nAS\n\n§\n\nNo disclosure or reporting obligations\n\nSource: Authors’ depiction.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nTaxonomies are rarely linked o disclosure and reporting obligations.\n\nTable 2\n\nThreshold examples in he energy and ranspor sectors \n\nfor he EU, Thailand, and Indonesia \n\nEU\n\nThailand \n\nIndonesia\n\nEnergy sector*\n\nThreshold for green: \n\n< 100 gCO2e/kWh, \n\n­previously no reduction \n\npath\n\nThreshold for green in \n\ntraffic ligh system:\n\n< 100 gCO2e/kWh\n\nReduction o \n\n< 50 gCO2e/kWh by 2040\n\nThreshold for green in \n\ntraffic ligh system:\n\n< 100 gCO2e/KWh\n\nNo raffic ligh system, \n\nhence no yellow category\n\nYellow in raffic ligh \n\nsystem: \n\nwill be reduced from < 382 \n\nto < 148 gCO2e/kWh in five-\n\nyear steps o zero by 2040\n\nYellow in raffic ligh system: \n\n< 510 gCO2/KWh (based \n\non the IEA Sustainable \n\n­Developmen Scenario \n\n(SDS))\n\nTransportation \n\n(Passenger \n\nvehicles and \n\nligh commercial \n\nvehicles)\n\nThreshold: \n\n< 50 g CO2 pro kilometer \n\ndriven (g CO2/km) \n\nEmissions mus be reduced \n\nto zero by 2026\n\nNo ransition period \n\n(­meaning hreshold is \n\nzero emissions)\n\nNo explicitly contained in \n\nthe axonomy/thresholds \n\nhave no ye been defined\n\nNotes: * (Life cycle emissions in electricity generation). gCO2e/kWh = grams of CO2 equivalen per \n\nkilowa hour.\n\nSources: Authors’ depiction; EU, Thai, and Indonesian axonomies.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\n197\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 28/2024\n\nSustainable finance axonomies\n\nJEL: G18, P00, Q01, Q58\n\nKeywords: Sustainable Finance Taxonomy, Green Finance, Transition Finance, \n\nEU Taxonomy, climate policy, ransition plans\n\nCatherine Marchewitz is a Research Associate in he Climate Policy \n\nDepartmen a DIW Berlin | cmarchewitz@diw.de\n\nFranziska Schütze is a Research Associate in he Climate Policy Departmen \n\na DIW Berlin | fschuetze@diw.de\n\nFernanda Ballesteros is a Ph.D. Studen in he Climate Policy Departmen a \n\nDIW Berlin | fballesteros@diw.de"
