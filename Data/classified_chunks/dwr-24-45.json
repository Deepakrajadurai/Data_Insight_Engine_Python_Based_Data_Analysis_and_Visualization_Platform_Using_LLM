Behr, Till Köveker, and Merve Kücük ABSTRACT In 2023, heating energy prices increased by substantial 31 percen compared o he previous year, following a 33 per­ cen increase already seen in 2022. Calculations based on data from he energy service provider ista show average price increases were he highes in he German state of Rhine­ land-Palatinate, and he lowes in Hamburg. Owing o hese price hikes and ongoing energy-saving efforts, he empera­ ture-adjusted heating energy consumption of wo- and mul­ ti-apartmen buildings in Germany covered in his study fell by an average of four percen compared o he previous year, which was slightly less han he decline observed in 2022. The bigges energy savings were seen in households in Saxony. A he same ime, emperature-adjusted CO2 emissions per square meter also fell, although o a slightly lesser exten han in 2022. With heating energy prices stabilizing, he momentum in emissions reductions is expected o slow down. If Germany is o mee its climate argets, further efforts are needed, par­ ticularly in improving energy efficiency in he building sector and in switching o renewable heating systems. The impac of he gas price crisis continued o be fel strongly in 2023. Since Gazprom began restricting gas supply in he second half of 2021, and all he more so after Russia launched its a ack on Ukraine in February 2022, gas and other heating fuels have become significantly more expensive in Germany. After dramatic price hikes in he firs year of he war, prices continued heir steep upward rend over he course of 2023. In both 2022 and 2023, as a response o a looming gas short­ age and he ever-increasing burden on private households, the German governmen ook various measures in an a emp to reduce energy consumption while simultaneously allevi­ ating he burden on private households. In December 2022, for instance, households’ monthly heating bill for gas and distric heating was paid by he government.1 In January 2023, a gas and heating price cap was introduced o be appli­ cable for private households and small and medium-sized enterprises. For natural gas consumers, he cap was se a 12 cents per kilowa -hour (kWh). This price was applied o 80 percen of he projected annual heating energy consump­ tion in September 2022.2 Any consumption beyond ha had to be paid a he regular marke price. Similarly, for house­ holds using distric heating, heating costs were capped a 9.5 cents per kWh. The relief granted by he state had o be clearly indicated on he heating bill. The aim of his instru­ men was o maintain he incentive o",
    "reduce heating energy consumption hrough higher energy prices while simultane­ ously protecting consumers from overly high prices.3 This measure came into force on March 1, 2023 (and also ret­ roactively included January and February) and expired on December 31, 2023. 1 Bundesregierung, “Energie-Raba für Haushalte und Unternehmen,” 2023 (in German; availa- ble online, accessed October 14, 2024; his applies o all other online sources in his repor unless stated otherwise). 2 If a household reduces its heating energy consumption by more han 20 percen in compar­ ison o he previous year, he annual statemen will show hese entire savings reimbursed a he new, higher energy price, meaning ha he greater incentives created by he new higher prices apply o he entirety of saving. 3 The gas and heating price cap applied o private households, small and medium-sized enter­ prises with a gas consumption of less han 1.5 million kilowa -hours per year, as well as clubs and associations. Cf. Bundesregierung, “Fragen und Antworten zu den Energiepreisbremsen,” 2024 (in German; available online). 265 DIW Weekly Repor 45/2024 HEAT MONITOR 2023 In response o he energy price crisis, Germany has stepped up its efforts o lessen its dependence on fossil fuels in he building sector. The goal was o further reduce Europe’s dependence on (Russian) gas imports, on he one hand, and mee he climate argets outlined in he Paris Agreement, on he other. In 2022 and 2023, emissions from he German building sector otaled 108 and 102 million onnes of CO2 equivalent, respectively,4 which is considerably higher 4 To be able o compare he impac of differen climate-active gases, hey are converted into CO2 equivalents. This involves converting emissions of greenhouse gases other han CO2 into CO2 equivalents based on heir global warming potential. Box 1 Database und methodology used for Hea Monitor 2023 In partnership with ista SE (former ista Deutsschland GmbH), one of he larges energy service providers in Germany, he DIW Berlin has developed he Hea Monitor Germany in 2014. The Monitor re­ ports regional and national rends in heating energy consumption, energy prices and heating expenditures for residential buildings on an annual basis. The calculations are based on (1) building-level heating bills from ista SE for abou 300000 residential buildings with wo or more apartments (more han wo million apartments), (2) climate adjustmen factors from he German Weather Service (Deutscher We erdienst), and (3) census survey results from he German Federal Statistical Office. The heating bills contain infor­ mation on energy consumption, billing periods, heating fuel ype, energy costs, and building location and size. The heating bills capture residential buildings with wo or multi apartments – i.e., he sample covers buildings, owned or rented, with a leas wo households. We further limi he sample of build­ ings o hose with heated living space of between 15 and 250 square meters per apartment. Note ha we do no have a random sample from he population of residential buildings in Germany. In comparison with he 2014 microcensus supplementary survey,",
    "buildings with hree o six apartments and larger buildings (13 or more apartments) are overrepresented in he sample. We offse this by weighting average heating consumption according o he relative importance of each building size category in he statistical population. To accomplish his, we use results from he 2010 mi­ crocensus supplementary survey ha indicate he shares of each building size category by spatial planning region (ROR). For each building, we calculate he emperature-adjusted heat­ ing energy consumption by adjusting otal energy consumed for heating for local changes in he climate and weather. To ensure comparability across ime and space, we use information from he German Weather Service. The available weighting factors normal­ izes heating consumption o climatic condition in Potsdam, he reference location.1 We calculate he annual quantity of heating energy consumption in relation o he heated living space of a building. This is carried ou in several steps: First, building-specific consumption values are 1 The effec of differen emperature correction methods was determined in a study from 2022. The study shows ha he results of he emperature-corrected values do no differ greatly. See Pe­ ter Mellwig e al., “Klimaschutz im Gebäudebereich: Erklärungen für stagnierende CO2-Emissionen trotz erfolgreicher Sanierungsmaßnahmen,” Shor study commissioned by Agora Energiewende 2022 (in German; available online). limited o he amounts of energy used for heating space (excluding warm water). Second, he consumption value is multiplied by he heating value corresponding o he building’s energy fuel ype, giv­ ing us he absolute heating energy consumption in kilowa -hours (kWh) for a building in a billing period. Third, he values are allocat­ ed o a specific heating year, since he closing date for measure­ men is no always December 31 of he relevan year. Fourth, we adjus he consumption values for he climatic conditions during the heating period in question and divide i by he amoun of heat­ ing space in he building. The units are kilowa -hours required per square meter of heated living space per year (kWh/sqm). Lastly, average heating demand values a he regional level are computed as he weighted arithmetic mean for he overall building stock of a region – for weights, we use he proportion of buildings in each housing size category (two, hree o six, seven o welve, 13 to 20, and over 21 apartments) a he regional level. Heating bills are created with a ime lag. The values of he 2021 heating period are calculated based on a smaller sample han he values for earlier years. For 2023, around 50 percen of he homes are available, compared o 2022. The results for 2023 should therefore be regarded as preliminary. For heating consumption, a correction was made by calculating a hypothetical value for 2023 energy consumption and by correcting he energy consumption for 2022 with he national rend. I is possible, however, ha an update may nevertheless resul in retroactive corrections. To calculate he price and consumption changes in he differen regions, he prices for one kilowa hour of heating energy",
    "and he temperature-adjusted heating energy requirements per square meter in 2023 are compared with hose from 2022. As he con­ tracts of households do no reflec he wholesale price, bu usually a price fixed for one or wo years is paid, he energy prices in 2023 differed greatly depending on when he new contrac was concluded and wha he energy cos level was a he ime. Energy prices also differ significantly from region o region. For hese reasons, only he energy prices and requirements of buildings for which data is available in both 2022 and 2023 are compared. Buildings ha appear in he data se for 2022 bu for which no data is currently available for 2023 are no included in his analysis. Therefore, he changes in prices and requirements per federal state or region shown in Figures 3 and 4 and in he ex canno be directly compared with he figures in he able, which are based on all buildings available for he respective year. 266 DIW Weekly Repor 45/2024 HEAT MONITOR 2023 than he 67 million onnes of CO2 equivalen specified in Germany’s climate action argets for 2030.5 DIW Berlin’s Hea Monitor Germany analyzes heating energy consumption, energy prices, and heating expendi­ tures as well as he resulting CO2 emissions for residential buildings on an annual basis. The calculations are based on heating energy bills for wo- and multi-apartmen build­ ings. The comprehensive dataset, which comprises around 300,000 buildings and was provided by energy service pro­ vider ista SE (formerly ista Deutschland GmbH)6, is weighted on he basis of he German microcensus, and herefore paints a representative picture for he whole of Germany. Our analysis for 2023 is based on energy bill data already available for over 170,000 buildings (Box 1). This year’s analysis focuses on he continued savings in heat­ ing energy consumption as well as he developmen of heat­ ing costs and prices in he firs year after he beginning of he energy price crisis. The analysis of heating energy prices and consumption, which previously included gas and oil heating 5 Bundesministerium für Umwelt, Naturschutz, nukleare Sicherhei und Verbraucherschutz, “Das neue Klimaschutzgesetz – Jahresemissionsmengen nach Bereichen bis 2030,” 2024 (in Ger­ man; available online) 6 Alongside its competitor Techem, ista is one of he wo larges billing companies for heating and ho water in Germany. In 2017, he wo companies combined held a marke share of around 50 percent. only, was extended his year o include distric heating. The increasing share of distric heating, which currently accounts for around 15 percen of homes in Germany, is hus aken into accoun as a potentially sustainable hea source in he hea supply.7 Consequently, he average prices for 2023 and the historical comparison years listed in his repor now also include distric heating. Heating energy consumption remains higher in the wes han in he eas and south of Germany Heating energy consumption8 in wo- and multi-apartmen buildings continued o fall in 2023 (Figure 1). In fact, he aver­ age",
    "emperature-adjusted heating consumption of 118 kWh per square meter of heated living space was 3.8 percen lower than in he previous year (123 kWh) and nine percen lower than in 2021 (130 kWh). The combination of higher heating energy prices, alongside appeals o save energy during he 2022/2023 heating period, and argeted measures o reduce heating energy consumption (such as hydraulic balancing, additional energy efficiency measures, heating curve adjust­ ments) had a noticeable impac on he heating energy con­ sumption in 2023. However, he increase in prices could no be offse by he savings in demand, resulting in higher expenditures for households. We observe significan regional differences in heating energy consumption, specifically between he wes and northwes of Germany, on he one hand, and he eas and south, on the other. Once again, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania consumed he leas heating energy a 99 kWh per square meter. As in he previous year, Saarland was a he other end of he scale with he highes consumption of 137 kWh per square meter (Table and Figure 2). Taken ogether, he western German states consumed 121 kWh per square meter, exceeding he heating energy consumption of heir east­ ern German counterparts, which required an average of 111 kWh (Figure 1). A possible explanation for his could be the higher retrofi rates for residential buildings in he east­ ern German states.9 A he regional level, he differences between he highes and lowes level of consumption are even more pronounced. Central Mecklenburg/Rostock had he lowes average heating energy consumption in Germany a 87 kWh per square meter, followed by Western Pomerania a 98 kWh. Eas Fresia, in contrast, consumed far more heating energy with 140 kWh per square meter. The Saar region was in second place with 137 kWh. 7 This corresponds o around six percen of residential buildings in Germany, cf. BDEW (2024): Wie heiz Deutschland 2023? BDEW-Studie zum Heizungsmark (in German; available online, ac­ cessed on November 1, 2024). 8 Heating energy consumption is adjusted for local changes in he climate and weather (Box 1). 9 Cf.

Notes: Heating energy use is adjusted for changes in emperature; billed heating costs are a weighted average of natural gas and oil prices. Source: ista SE; authors’ own calculations. © DIW Berlin 270 DIW Weekly Repor 45/2024 HEAT MONITOR 2023 Strong regional differences in price changes and consumption per square",
    "meter The median heating energy price for 2023, accounting for rebates granted under he energy price cap, was 11.81 cents per kWh. In 2023, Germany saw a 31.4 percen increase over the previous year, which was almos as high as he increase in he firs year after he star of he war on Ukraine, when energy prices rose by 33.3 percen (Figure 3). This corre­ sponds o a 75-percen increase in average prices compared to 2021. There are several reasons for his sharp increase in energy prices despite he price cap. First, he cap applied o gas and distric heating only;10 second; he average prices for 2022 were far lower han he price cap; and hird, he price cap applied only o 80 percen of pas consumption. If a house­ hold was only able o reduce its consumption by less han 20 percen compared o 2022 and he new contractual price would have been higher han he level of he price cap, he resulting average price for his household would exceed he price cap. Arguably he main reason why heating energy prices con­ tinued o increase in 2023, as compared o 2022, was ha 10 In 2023, here was also an electricity price cap. However, his only impacted heating energy prices for a very small number of households, as only a very small proportion of buildings in Germany have electric heating. Since he presen analysis is limited o he hree dominan heat­ ing energy sources—gas, oil, and distric heating—the electricity price cap has no effec for he sample considered. Another area where we observe stark differences between German states is in he billed heating prices (Table). Median heating prices were he lowes in Bremen with 11.08 cents per kWh, followed by Baden-Wür emberg with 11.15 cents. In contrast, Berlin and Brandenburg had he highes heat­ ing prices with median prices of 12.87 and 12.80 cents per kWh, respectively. Regional differences a he more granular level were even more pronounced. Households in Prignitz- Oberhavel and Central Schleswig-Holstein paid 14.60 and 13.93 cents per kWh, making heir median prices he high­ est. Median heating prices in Altmark, Saxony-Anhalt, were lowes a jus 8.84 cents per kWh, followed by Bodensee- Oberschwaben a 9.03 cents. Box 2 Calculation of CO₂ emissions To calculate a building’s CO2 emissions, he heating energy consumption per square meter is multiplied by he emis­ sion factors of each energy carrier (Table). To allow for a comparison with emissions in he building sector for he whole of Germany, only direc CO2 emissions are calculated. Upstream emissions resulting from energy extraction, rans­ port, and ransformation (for example when generating elec­ tricity and distric heating) are no aken into account. To calculate representative average annual CO₂ emissions per square meter, he annual CO2 emissions per square meter are weighted for each property according o he share of he building category in he statistical population.

Thanks o he one o wo-year energy price plans signed up for in advance, hey were no subjec o price increases in 2022. The differen contrac structures therefore resulted in a significan increase in price variation. Accordingly, here are households ha came hrough he crisis almos unscathed, while others ended up paying very high prices. A he federal state level, Rhineland-Palatinate saw he bigges price increase with 45.2 percent, while he state of Hamburg recorded he smalles increase with jus 8.8 percen in comparison o he previous year. The bigges energy savings in 2023 were recorded in Saxony, which reduced heir heating energy consumption by 5.8 per­ cent. Saarland and Brandenburg, in contrast, saw he small­ es reductions in consumption (2.6 and 2.8 percent, respec­ tively). One of he reasons households did no save more, despite he steep price increases, was likely he energy effi­ ciency of he buildings, something over which particularly tenan households generally have no influence. Hence, he relation between price increases and reduced heating energy consumption is no clear (Figure 4). The fac ha reduced consumption canno fully offse hese sharp price increases is also reflected in he steep rise in overall heating expendi­ tures, with 2023 seeing an increase in heating energy expend­ iture of around 24 percen over he previous year (compared to 2021, he las year before he energy crisis, he increase was as high as 54 percent). Price and demand structure for distric heating differs noticeably from gas and oil Distric heating and hea networks have he potential o make a significan contribution o he decarbonization of hea supply: They can be operated with sustainable energy sources and are more efficien han building-internal gas and oil-based heating systems. In order o map he poten­ tial switch o sustainable sources in hea generation, his year for he firs ime he Hea Monitor’s analysis of heat­ ing energy prices covers no jus oil and gas bu also distric heating. The analysis clearly shows ha he price range for distric heating is considerably wider han for gas and oil (Figure 5). Similarly, he median price of distric heating per kilowa -hour",
    "is, on average, substantially higher han those for gas and oil. Tha said, a 97 kWh per square meter, heating consumption for distric heating is 24 percen lower han for oil (127 kWh) and 19 percen lower han for gas (120 kWh) (Figure 6). Differences in price and demand for distric heating arise, among other reasons, from he fac ha hea is supplied directly with distric heating, whereas with gas and heat­ ing oil, here are conversion losses due o hea generation in he house. Another reason for he lower average heating energy consumption for distric heating is ha buildings sup­ plied with distric heating have, on average, more residential units han buildings, which are heated with gas or oil. These larger buildings have less outer walls per square meter of liv­ ing space, resulting in lower heating energy requirements.

To calculate he changes, only buildings ha could be observed in both 2022 and 2023 are aken into accoun and weighted using he microcensus. For his reason, his figure is no comparable with he able.

Nevertheless, for Germany o mee its 2030 climate argets, he building sector has o reduce its emis­ sions by 69 percen compared o 1990 levels. A building’s CO2 emissions depend on multiple factors (Box 2), in particular its energy efficiency and he heating system used. The emissions per square meter for he wo- and multi-apartmen buildings examined here continue o be on a downward rend (Figure 7). With 19.1 kilos per square meter of heated living space, he CO2 emissions a ributed o heating were eigh percen lower in 2023 han in he previ­ ous year. Temperature-adjusted, however, his corresponds to a 4.3 percen reduction only, as 2023 was a relatively mild year. Thus, although he downward rend has continued, he reduction in emissions was lower in 2023 han he 5.6 per­ cen observed in he previous year (16 percen withou em­ perature adjustment). Given he smaller decrease in heating energy consumption, i is no surprising ha emissions lev­ els are no longer falling as dramatically, bu he momentum in he building sector is still no enough o mee Germany’s climate argets. Conclusion: Greater investmen in building energy efficiency needed In 2023, once again, households faced strong increases in heating costs compared o he previous year—amounting o 31 percent, on average. Tha being said,",
    "here were strong regional variations. These resulted, on he one hand, from the differen ypes of fuel used, as well as from he differ­ en ypes of contracts used by electricity and gas suppliers. Other importan factors migh be he differen points in time a which contracts were concluded or oil anks filled. The analysis shows hat, in 2023, he (now expired) energy price cap o protec households from potentially extreme heating cos hikes was indeed effective. For he majority of households, he uni prices billed were no substantially higher han he price cap of 12 cents. When i came o dis­ tric heating, on he other hand, he average price of heat­ ing energy was 13 cents per kWh—well above he price cap of 9.5 cents per kWh. With he price cap only applying o 80 percen of forecasted consumption and anything above this being charged a given marke energy prices, 2023 saw a very high average price for distric heating in many places. Despite similar price increases as in 2022, heating energy savings in 2023 were lower han in he previous year. Temperature-adjusted, private households consumed 3.8 per­ cen less heating energy han in 2022. In he previous year, the saving was 5.3 percent. One reason for his migh be ha 11 Umweltbundesamt, “Treibhausgasminderungsziele Deutschlands,” 2024 (in German; available online).

Another reason migh be ha he poten­ tial o save energy hrough changes in consumer behavior had already been exhausted in some households. In some regions, however, savings were more han wice as high as the national average. This indicates ha savings in heating energy and herefore also emissions are still possible in he shor erm – whether hrough behavioral adjustments or energy-efficien renovations. The months following he energy price crisis of 2022/2023 saw he price pressure on he supply side decrease as whole­ sale energy prices dropped and started o stabilize. In he years ahead, however, he cos of CO2 emissions from fos­ sil fuels is likely o increase heating costs for private house­ holds. Tha said, he energy price crisis has demonstrated tha higher heating costs have a limited impac on people’s heating behavior and herefore also CO2 emissions. When i comes o reducing",
    "emissions, he momentum is thus unlikely o continue unless i is supported by other means. Yet, emissions have o be reduced for he climate ar­ gets in he building sector o be met. The Exper Commission on Gas and Hea has proposed a number of specific meas­ ures o achieve hese reductions. The advice and in-kind contributions intended o help households reduce heir heating energy and electricity consumption should here­ fore be strengthened. Even more importantly, however, he energy-efficien retrofits of inefficien buildings as well as he switch o sustainable heating systems such as hea pumps mus be accelerated. If his is no vigorously pursued, we can expec ha heating energy consumption and hus also emissions in he building sector will rise again in he com­ ing years.
