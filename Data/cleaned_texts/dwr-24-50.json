The \n\ncontinuing lack of orders in manufacturing, increasing \n\ninternational competition, and sluggish development in \n\nindustry-related services are now affecting the labor mar­\n\nket and leading not only to short-time work but to layoffs \n\ntoo, despite the continuing skilled worker shortage. While \n\nGDP increased slightly by 0.1 percent in the third quarter \n\nof 2023, this growth was preceded by a stronger than \n\ninitially recorded decline in economic output of 0.3 percent \n\nin the second quarter. Thus, the German economy cannot \n\nbe said to be on a stable growth path. In contrast, leading \n\nindicators suggest that economic output will decline again \n\nin the fourth quarter, with overall growth for 2024 likely to \n\nbe 0.2 percent. This means that the German economy will \n\ncontract for the second year in a row.\n\nGerman industry in particular is experiencing a serious \n\ncrisis. Foreign trade may temporarily benefit, as many com­\n\npanies despite a lack of demand are expected to increase \n\ntheir exports to the United States in order to get ahead of \n\nthe possible tariffs that US President-elect Donald Trump \n\nannounced. However, impending protectionist measures \n\nare already having an impact and unsettling local compa­\n\nnies, which are therefore postponing investments further. \n\nIn addition, the economic framework conditions in Ger­\n\nmany are unclear and will remain unpredictable until at \n\nleast the spring when there is a new federal government. \n\nAll of these factors in conjunction with increasing concerns \n\nabout their own jobs are unsettling households in Ger­\n\nmany, resulting in private consumption failing to pick up \n\nspeed despite rising real wages.\n\nA gradual easing is not expected until mid-2025, when \n\ndomestic and foreign economic uncertainties will succes­\n\nsively lessen. Nevertheless, the German economy should \n\nexpand by 0.2 percent in 2025. Thus, DIW Berlin is revis­\n\ning its fall forecast downward by 0.7 percentage points. \n\nEconomic output is expected to increase by 1.2 percent in \n\n2026, although this is partially due to non-recurring effects \n\nsuch as a relatively high number of work days.\n\nIn regard to the global economy, the boom in the United \n\nStates will remain a key driver for now, compensating for \n\nthe sluggish recovery in many other advanced econo­\n\nmies as well as China. While the Chinese economy falters, \n\na gradual upswing is continuing in the euro area due to \n\nrising purchasing power and falling inflation. In 2024, the \n\nglobal economy is expected to grow by 3.7 percent, while \n\nit should grow by 3.6 percent and 3.7 percent in 2025 and \n\n2026, respectively.\n\n313\n\nDIW Weekly Report 50–52/2024\n\nGLOBAL ECONOMY\n\nThe sustained boom in the United States is once again \n\ndetermining the expansion tempo of the global economy in \n\n2024, compensating for the sluggish recovery in many other \n\nadvanced economies and China. Thus, the gap in economic \n\noutput between the United States and other important econ­\n\nomies such as the euro area is growing. Purchasing power \n\nhas recovered in the euro area and the United Kingdom and \n\nis supporting a gradual upturn there. The Chinese economy \n\nis faltering, meaning it will not reach its growth target of five \n\npercent for 2024. Lastly, the economic and trade policies of \n\nUS President-elect Donald Trump are putting the global eco­\n\nnomic order to the test.\n\nGlobal economic growth has picked up speed recently: The \n\nglobal economy expanded by 0.8 percent in the third quar­\n\nter of 2024 after growth of 0.7 percent in the second quarter \n\n(Figure 1). In the fall, global growth in the advanced econ­\n\nomies was primarily driven by a strong increase of 0.7 per­\n\ncent in the United States. Most other advanced economies \n\nare continuing to recover at a moderate pace; for example, \n\nthe British and Japanese economies grew by only 0.1 and \n\n0.2 percent, respectively. The euro area, in contrast, contin­\n\nued its recovery, recording an increase of 0.4 percent. Spain \n\nand the Netherlands grew the most by 0.8 percent each, \n\nfollowed by France by 0.4 percent. In contrast, Italy and \n\nGermany stagnated.\n\nThe economies of the Central and Southeastern EU coun­\n\ntries suffered from weak demand from Germany. In these \n\ncountries, economic output declined by 0.2 percent in the \n\nthird quarter of 2024. The only exception was Czechia, where \n\nGDP increased by 0.3 percent.\n\nFollowing a weak second quarter, the situation was some­\n\nwhat better for emerging economies. The Chinese economy \n\npicked up speed and recorded growth of 0.9 percent. The pace \n\nof expansion of the Indian economy has also been stronger \n\nrecently, and Mexico’s GDP increased by 1.1 percent in the \n\nthird quarter. In contrast, growth of 0.9 percent in Brazil was \n\nweaker than in the previous quarter.\n\nDespite the expected geopolitical and trade policy cutbacks, \n\nthe global economy should expand slightly in the fourth quar­\n\nter of 2024, in part thanks to China’s increasingly strong eco­\n\nnomic growth. Most advanced economies are losing momen­\n\ntum slightly, and the leading indicators deteriorated in the \n\nfall months. The slump in global industrial production con­\n\ntinues as well: The Purchasing Managers Indices for the \n\nUnited States and the euro area were tilted to the downside \n\nfrom May to September and recently moved sideways. The \n\npicture in the services sector appears to be mixed: While the \n\nUnited States experienced strong growth in November, the \n\nindices for the euro area fell below the expansion threshold. \n\nIn October, the Purchasing Manager’s Index for manufac­\n\nturing in the United Kingdom dropped below 50, a trend \n\nthat continued into November. The index for Japanese man­\n\nufacturing is continuing its sideways movement slightly \n\nbelow the expansion threshold. In surveys, the newest polit­\n\nical developments, such as Trump’s re-election and the col­\n\nlapse of the German government coalition, were only par­\n\ntially reflected. However, these events are likely to have led \n\nto increased uncertainty among firms and private house­\n\nholds alike about future economic policy frameworks. The \n\nbiggest uncertainties concern the future trade policy of the \n\nUnited States. To hedge against this, companies will likely \n\npull orders forward, meaning that exports to the United \n\nStates should initially be somewhat stronger than expected. \n\nHowever, this will presumably not be reflected in the aggre­\n\ngated global economic output.\n\nWe expect growth in the United States in the fourth quarter \n\nof 2024 will continue to be strong, albeit somewhat weaker \n\nthan in the third quarter, and supported by private consump­\n\ntion in particular. The recovery in the euro area will lose \n\nsome momentum for the time being: For example, France \n\nis experiencing a weak fourth quarter following the one-\n\noff effects related to the Olympic Games. The Japanese and \n\nThe rising shadow of protectionism is negatively \n\naffecting the global economy\n\nFigure 1\n\nGrowth of real GDP\n\nQuarter-on-quarter percentage growth (left axis);  \n\nIndex 2015 Q1 = 100 (right axis)\n\n \n\nSources: National Statistical Offices; DIW Berlin Economic Outlook Winter 2024.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nTightened trade barriers are likely to slow the global economy down somewhat.\n\n314\n\nDIW Weekly Report 50–52/2024\n\nGLOBAL ECONOMY\n\nSouth Korean economies, in contrast, are projected to gain \n\nsome momentum again. In China, the outlook has improved \n\ndue to the recently announced monetary and fiscal policy \n\nmeasures, which has brightened economic sentiment.\n\nWe assume that a less restrictive monetary policy will sup­\n\nport economic growth in the coming years. The central banks \n\nof many advanced economies will likely cut interest rates \n\nfurther in 2025. The inflation rate continues to be lower in \n\nmany places, which is mainly due to falling energy prices. \n\nInflation in the services sector remains high in many places. \n\nEmerging economies have initiated an interest rate turna­\n\nround earlier and may have reached the end of the inter­\n\nest rate cuts. For example, inflation in Mexico is proving \n\nto be more persistent than expected, and the Central Bank \n\nof Brazil recently raised interest rates again in response \n\nto higher core inflation. In contrast, the People's Bank of \n\nChina is following a loose  monetary policy due to deflation­\n\nary tendencies.\n\nFiscal policy is slightly expansionary in most economies. In \n\nthe United Kingdom, the Labour government passed its fall \n\nbudget, ushering in an expansionary fiscal policy. Fiscal pol­\n\nicy in the United States is also likely to be expansionary over \n\nthe forecast horizon due to many of President-elect Trump’s \n\nproposals. At the end of September, the Chinese government \n\nannounced its largest stimulus package since the pandemic. \n\nEqualing around 1,300 billion euros, the package focuses on \n\nsolving the debt problems of local governments. An excep­\n\ntion to the expansionary fiscal policy is the euro area, where \n\nfiscal policy will likely remain slightly restrictive over the \n\nforecast period.\n\nTable 1\n\nReal GDP, consumer prices, and unemployment rates in the global economy\n\nIn percent\n\nGDP\n\nConsumer prices\n\nUnemployment rate in percent\n\nYear-on-year percentage change\n\n2023 \n\n2024 \n\n2025 \n\n2026 \n\n2023 \n\n2024 \n\n2025 \n\n2026 \n\n2023 \n\n2024 \n\n2025 \n\n2026 \n\nEurope\n\nEuropean Union\n\n0.5\n\n0.9\n\n1.5\n\n1.9\n\n6.4 \n\n2.6 \n\n2.4\n\n2.2\n\n6.1\n\n6.0\n\n5.9\n\n5.7\n\nEuro area\n\n0.5\n\n0.7\n\n1.1\n\n1.4\n\n5.4 \n\n2.4 \n\n2.1\n\n2.0\n\n6.6\n\n6.4\n\n6.3\n\n6.2\n\nexcluding Germany\n\n1.2\n\n1.3\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n5.0 \n\n2.2 \n\n2.0\n\n1.9\n\n8.3\n\n7.9\n\n7.7\n\n7.5\n\nFrance\n\n1.1\n\n1.1\n\n0.9\n\n1.5\n\n5.7 \n\n2.4 \n\n1.9\n\n1.8\n\n7.3\n\n7.5\n\n7.4\n\n7.3\n\nItaly\n\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n5.9 \n\n1.1 \n\n1.9\n\n2.0\n\n7.7\n\n6.7\n\n6.5\n\n6.4\n\nSpain\n\n2.7\n\n3.1\n\n2.3\n\n2.2\n\n3.4 \n\n2.8 \n\n2.3\n\n1.9\n\n12.2\n\n11.5\n\n11.1\n\n10.8\n\nNetherlands\n\n0.1\n\n1.0\n\n2.2\n\n1.8\n\n4.1 \n\n3.1 \n\n2.5\n\n2.0\n\n3.6\n\n3.7\n\n3.6\n\n3.6\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\n0.3\n\n0.9\n\n1.2\n\n1.2\n\n7.3 \n\n2.5 \n\n2.2\n\n2.1\n\n4.0\n\n4.3\n\n4.4\n\n4.3\n\nSwitzerland\n\n0.7\n\n1.7\n\n1.8\n\n1.8\n\n2.1 \n\n1.2 \n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n4.0\n\n4.2\n\n4.3\n\n4.1\n\nCentral and Eastern Europe\n\n0.5\n\n1.7\n\n2.7\n\n3.4\n\n11.6 \n\n4.0 \n\n3.4\n\n3.0\n\n3.6\n\n3.7\n\n3.5\n\n3.4\n\nTurkey\n\n5.1\n\n3.4\n\n2.9\n\n3.4\n\n54.0 \n\n58.7 \n\n35.9\n\n29.8\n\n9.4\n\n8.7\n\n9.0\n\n8.6\n\nRussia1\n\n3.3\n\n3.5\n\n1.7\n\n1.5\n\n5.9 \n\n8.2 \n\n6.5\n\n4.6\n\n3.2\n\n2.5\n\n2.4\n\n2.4\n\nThe Americas\n\nUSA\n\n2.9\n\n2.7\n\n2.4\n\n2.2\n\n4.1 \n\n2.8 \n\n2.2\n\n2.2\n\n3.6\n\n4.0\n\n4.1\n\n3.9\n\nMexico\n\n3.2\n\n1.3\n\n1.4\n\n1.8\n\n5.5 \n\n4.6 \n\n3.2\n\n2.9\n\n2.8\n\n2.7\n\n2.6\n\n2.6\n\nBrazil\n\n2.9\n\n3.0\n\n2.4\n\n2.3\n\n4.6 \n\n4.2 \n\n3.1\n\n2.9\n\n8.0\n\n7.0\n\n6.8\n\n6.9\n\nAsia\n\nJapan\n\n1.7\n\n−0.1\n\n1.2\n\n0.9\n\n3.3 \n\n2.6 \n\n1.9\n\n1.6\n\n2.6\n\n2.6\n\n2.4\n\n2.3\n\nSouth Korea\n\n1.4\n\n2.2\n\n2.0\n\n2.2\n\n3.6 \n\n2.4 \n\n1.9\n\n1.9\n\n2.7\n\n2.8\n\n3.0\n\n3.0\n\nChina\n\n5.2\n\n4.7\n\n4.5\n\n4.3\n\n−1.7 \n\n0.4 \n\n1.3\n\n1.4\n\n5.2\n\n5.1\n\n5.0\n\n5.0\n\nIndia\n\n7.8\n\n6.5\n\n6.1\n\n6.6\n\n5.7 \n\n4.9 \n\n5.7\n\n4.6\n\n8.1\n\n7.9\n\n7.5\n\n7.3\n\nTotal\n\nAdvanced economies\n\n1.9\n\n1.8\n\n1.8\n\n1.8\n\n4.8 \n\n3.0 \n\n2.3\n\n2.3\n\n4.4\n\n4.5\n\n4.5\n\n4.3\n\nEmerging economies\n\n5.5\n\n4.7\n\n4.5\n\n4.6\n\n4.5 \n\n5.9 \n\n5.7\n\n5.4\n\n6.2\n\n6.0\n\n5.8\n\n5.7\n\nGlobal economy\n\n4.1\n\n3.7\n\n3.6\n\n3.7\n\n4.3 \n\n3.9 \n\n3.5\n\n3.4\n\n5.8\n\n5.7\n\n5.5\n\n5.4\n\nFor reference:\n\nExport weighted2\n\n3.1\n\n2.8\n\n2.8\n\n2.8\n\nGDP weighted in USD3\n\n3.4\n\n3.1\n\n3.1\n\n3.1\n\n1 The data forecast for Russia are subject to major uncertainties.

Assuming \n\nthat global trade barriers are tightened from 2025 onwards, \n\ninternational trade is likely to be stronger in the fourth quar­\n\nter of 2024, due to anticipated purchases . Therefore, overall \n\ngrowth of 1.2 percent is expected for 2024. Only a moderate \n\nupswing is expected for 2025 and 2026 due to likely tighter \n\ntrade barriers. Furthermore, industry’s ongoing weak growth \n\nshould continue to weigh on international trade before fall­\n\ning interest rates boost corporate investment somewhat at \n\nthe end of 2025 and support international trade.\n\nIn the coming years, the expected increase in trade barri­\n\ners is likely to slow global economic growth. This forecast \n\nassumes that the US government will increase tariff rates on \n\nChinese goods imports by 10 percentage points, resulting in \n\nan average rate on Chinese exports of around 30 percent. At \n\nthe same time, the forecast also assumes that the aluminum \n\nand steel tariffs on the European Union, which had been sus­\n\npended by the Biden administration, will be reintroduced. \n\nIn reaction to the increase in US tariffs, it is assumed that \n\nthe economies affected will take targeted countermeasures, \n\nbut avoid an escalation. Due to tariff asymmetries, regions \n\nmay be affected differently.\n\nBox 1\n\nAssumptions and framework conditions\n\nAssumptions about interest rates, exchange rates, \n\nand energy prices\n\nThis forecast is based on the following assumptions about the \n\nfurther development of key interest rates, exchange rates, and \n\ncommodity prices (Table). These assumptions were made based \n\non previous developments, futures markets prices, and the clos­\n\ning prices on the date of this forecast (November 12, 2024). The \n\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) decreased interest rates once again \n\nin October, thus continuing the path of normalization. For the win­\n\nter forecast, four further interest rate cuts of 25 basis points each \n\nare assumed for the deposit rate until spring 2025. The money \n\nmarket interest rates also fell in line with key interest rates. We \n\nexpect that key interest rates will continue to fall until mid-2025 \n\nand then remain at that level. The transmission of interest rate cuts \n\ninto the real economy is also beginning to show. For example, the \n\nrefinancing costs for households and firms began to decline in the \n\nsecond quarter of 2024, and this decline is likely to continue in line \n\nwith key interest rates. The yield on government bonds increased \n\nagain slightly in the fourth quarter of 2024. We assume that cap­\n\nital market interest rates will remain largely unchanged over the \n\nforecast horizon at 2.3 percent for Germany and 2.9 percent for the \n\neuro area. The euro has recently appreciated slightly against the \n\nUS dollar. For the forecast period, it is assumed that the exchange \n\nrate of EUR to USD will remain at 1.07 USD per EUR, the level \n\nreached at the end of the data period. According to futures, the \n\nprice for Brent oil should increase slightly in the coming months \n\nbefore declining again at the start of 2025 until the end of the \n\nforecast period. In 2024, the average price should be 81 USD per \n\nbarrel before declining to an average of 73 USD per barrel in 2025 \n\nand finally to 71 USD per barrel in 2026. The wholesale price for \n\ngas (TTF) rose over the course of 2024 and should be 34 euros per \n\nmegawatt hour on average. Over the forecast horizon, we assume \n\nthat the prices will increase to 40 euros in 2025 before falling to \n\n34 euros per megawatt hour in 2026.\n\nGeopolitical and trade policy assumptions\n\nAdditionally, the forecast assumes that there will be no further es­\n\ncalation in the war in Ukraine. In the Middle East, an easing of ten­\n\nsions is becoming increasingly less likely. The fall of former Syrian \n\nPresident Bashar al-Assad is causing uncertainty and could lead to \n\nhigher oil and gas prices. In addition, this forecast assumes that US \n\nPresident-elect Trump will implement some of the trade tariffs he \n\nhas announced. It is assumed that the American government will \n\nincrease tariff rates by 10 percentage points for all goods imported \n\nfrom China in the first quarter of 2025. As a result, the average \n\ntariff rate on Chinese goods, which is currently around 20 percent, \n\nwould increase again by half to around 30 percent (including \n\nautomotive tariffs and 100-percent tariffs on e-cars). The tariffs on \n\nEuropean Union aluminum and steel, which had been suspended, \n\nwill be implemented again (10 percent for aluminum and 25 per­\n\ncent for steel). Furthermore, trade partners will presumably forego \n\nbroad countermeasures and only react with retaliatory tariffs on \n\nspecific groups of goods.\n\nTable\n\nForecast assumptions\n\n2023\n\n2024\n\n2025\n\n2026\n\nECB deposit rate1 (year end)\n\nPercent\n\n4.0\n\n3.0\n\n2.25\n\n2.25\n\nMoney market interest rate\n\nThree-month EURIBOR in percent\n\n3.4\n\n3.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.0\n\nCapital market interest\n\nYield on euro-area government bonds \n\nwith a remaining term of 10 years\n\n3.3\n\n3.0\n\n2.9\n\n2.9\n\nCapital market interest\n\nYield on German government bonds \n\nwith a remaining term of 10 years\n\n2.6\n\n2.4\n\n2.3\n\n2.3\n\nExchange rate\n\nUSD/EUR\n\n1.08\n\n1.08\n\n1.06\n\n1.06\n\nCrude oil price\n\nUSD per barrel\n\n82.5\n\n80.3\n\n72.9\n\n70.9\n\nGas price\n\nEUR per megawatt hour\n\n42.1\n\n34.1\n\n40.4\n\n34.2\n\n1 The ECB is currently steering the economy via the deposit facility, not the main refinancing rate (key interest \n\nrate).\n\nNote: Annual average values; ECB deposit facility values at the end of the year.\n\nSources: European Central Bank; European Money Markets Institute (EMMI); Eurex Exchange; Deutsche Bundes-\n\nbank;  Federal Reserve; Energy Information Administration (EIA); Intercontinental Exchange (ICE); CME Group; \n\nDIW Berlin  Economic Forecast Winter 2024.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\n316\n\nDIW Weekly Report 50–52/2024\n\nGLOBAL ECONOMY\n\nBox 2\n\nTrump reloaded: Expected American trade policy\n\nMajority of tariff announcements likely to function as \n\nbargaining chips\n\nAn increase in protectionist measures in the United States is ex­\n\npected over the forecast horizon. President-elect Donald Trump \n\nhas made contradictory and sometimes extreme announcements \n\nabout tariff increases. It is likely that Trump will continue the trade \n\npolicy of his first term and that the threat of additional import tariffs \n\nwill primarily serve as a means of exerting pressure in bilateral \n\nnegotiations, with tariffs likely to be implemented only partially. \n\nConcretely, this forecast assumes that following Trump’s inaugu­\n\nration, tariffs on Chinese goods will increase by 10 percent1 and \n\nthe tariffs on European Union aluminum and steel, which were \n\nsuspended by the Biden administration (10 percent for aluminum \n\nand 25 percent for steel), will be reimplemented. Furthermore, the \n\nUnited States’ trade partners will presumably avoid broad counter­\n\nmeasures and only react with retaliatory tariffs on specific groups \n\nof goods.\n\nAlthough Trump announced further drastic measures such as \n\nuniversal import tariffs of 10 or 20 percent during his election \n\ncampaign, these would have considerable economic and polit­\n\nical implications if implemented. On the one hand, tariffs of this \n\nmagnitude would considerably increase the prices of imported \n\ngoods and thus create strong inflation, potentially accompanied \n\nby supply chain disruptions and a supply shortage in the United \n\nStates.2 This is likely to be met with considerable resistance from \n\nthe public as well as from industry. For example, a study has shown \n\nthat high inflation rates considerably decrease approval of the \n\nreigning government.3 In addition, a sharp increase in import tariffs \n\ncould destabilize the stock markets, as indicated by the recent \n\ndrop in shares of the car manufacturers General Motors and Ford \n\nfollowing Trump’s announcements of tariffs on Mexican imports. \n\nFinally, there are legal hurdles which, despite the US President’s \n\nfar-reaching powers, are likely to make an escalation in trade spol­\n\nicy more difficult.\n\nIf all tariffs actually are implemented, they will cause \n\nsignificant real economic distortions\n\nNevertheless, there is great uncertainty regarding these assump­\n\ntions and it seems possible that considerably comprehensive pro­\n\ntectionist measures will be implemented. Drastic import tariffs are \n\nnot only justified as a means of obtaining concessions from trade \n\npartners, but also as a means of generating public revenue as well \n\n1 \n\nCf.

Although these \n\njustifications are not empirically sound, they could point to the \n\nactual implementation of more far-reaching tariffs.\n\nFor example, Trump has repeatedly announced universal import \n\ntariffs of 10 percent and tariffs on Chinese imports of 60 percent. \n\nThis would be a drastic break from previous American trade pol­\n\nicy; for example, the average effective tariff rate in 2023 was only \n\n3.8 percent. Such a massive tightening of trade policy would also \n\nhave very negative economic consequences for the United States. \n\nFor example, model calculations4 show that implementing univer­\n\nsal import tariffs of 10 percent without trade policy reactions would \n\nreduce US production by 0.4 percentage points by the end of the \n\nforecast horizon. In the year of the tariff increase, inflation would be \n\n0.6 percentage points higher. \n\nThe Federal Reserve would likely respond to this strong price \n\npressure with a restrictive course, which would dampen domestic \n\neconomic activity. In the long term, comprehensive tariffs are also \n\nlikely to weaken the competitiveness of the US economy due to \n\nhigher production costs and the shifting of resources to less pro­\n\nductive sectors.5 The United States’ trade partners could respond \n\nwith broad retaliatory tariffs, which could trigger a trade war and \n\nfurther destabilize international trade relations. Positive effects of \n\nthe import tariffs on the US economy will likely be limited. For ex­\n\nample, a study6 shows that the tariffs during Trump’s first term did \n\nnot create any jobs in tariffed sectors. On the contrary, the result­\n\ning counter tariffs imposed by China were economically costly for \n\nthe United States7 and negatively affected employment levels.8 \n\nAt the same time, the tariffs would not reduce the trade deficit,9 \n\npartly due to an expected appreciation of the US dollar, which \n\nmakes exports more expensive and imports cheaper.\n\nThe global economy would also be hit hard by such a comprehen­\n\nsive increase in US tariffs. For example, exports will decline and \n\nproduction will fall in the rest of the world, while at the same time \n\ngoods imported from the United States will become more expen­\n\nsive due to a likely appreciation of the US dollar. The negative con­\n\nsequences for individual countries will likely depend on the tariff \n\namount and the country’s dependency on the United States as a \n\ntrade partner.

The economic \n\nconsequences of the tariffs may thus be rather limited overall, but \n\nthere are significant regional differences. A study10 investigated \n\npossible consequences of a universal import tariff of 10 percent, \n\n60 percent on Chinese imports, and 100 percent on all imported \n\ncars. According to the model calculations in the study, the EU’s \n\nGDP is expected to decline by around 0.11 percent.11 \n\nGermany’s economy, in contrast, would be hit even harder; impos­\n\ning import tariffs on cars would severely affect German industry.12 \n\nIn addition, the United States is the most important individual \n\nsales market for German pharmaceutical companies. If US gas \n\nexports to the EU are used as a means of political pressure, \n\nthere is also the risk that energy prices will rise again. This would \n\nlikely further burden the beleaguered manufacturing industry in \n\nGermany in particular. However, Germany could benefit from tariff \n\nasymmetries and trade diversification, which may somewhat com­\n\npensate for the negative effects; an escalation of the trade conflict \n\nbetween the United States and China that entails significantly \n\nhigher tariffs on both trade partners would make German products \n\nrelatively more affordable. At the same time, the tariff policy may \n\nlead to more diversification of trade relationships with other coun­\n\ntries,13 which could further increase demand for German products.\n\nWith a share of around 15 percent of total export volume in 2023, \n\nthe United States is China’s most important trade partner. An in­\n\ncrease in tariffs on all imported Chinese goods to 60 percent would \n\nhit the Chinese economy hard and lead to distortions in interna­\n\ntional trade. At the same time, China may, as in 2018, take counter­\n\nmeasures, which would likely strengthen the effect. During the first \n\nTrump administration, the counter tariffs were around the amount \n\nof the American tariffs, which avoided an escalation.\n\nTariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods could result in significant \n\neconomic losses for both countries. In Canada, the crude oil sec­\n\ntor14 would be affected, while in Mexcio, the automobile industry, \n\nthe country's most important industrial sector, would be affected \n\nin particular.\n\n10 Cf. Aurélien Saussay, The economic impacts of Trump’s tariff proposals on Europe \n\n(Policy Publication, London School of Economics: 2024) (available online).\n\n11 The United Kingdom’s GDP is also projected to experience only a moderate decline of \n\n0.14 percent.\n\n12 Cf.

While a pro­\n\ntectionist trade policy and restrictive immigration policy will \n\nlead to price pressure, falling energy prices will likely dampen \n\nthis pressure in the forecast period. Continued strong con­\n\nsumption should contribute to growth, supported by house­\n\nholds’ good financial situation, a solid labor market, and \n\nplanned tax relief for private households under the new gov­\n\nernment. Corporate investments will likely support growth \n\nas well, driven by better financing conditions, the recovery \n\nof the real estate sector, and an expected decrease in the cor­\n\nporate income tax.\n\nThe euro area economy should expand further in 2025 and \n\n2026 due to strong domestic demand as a result of rising real \n\nwages (Figure 2). The effects of US tariffs as assumed in this \n\nforecast should only marginally hamper growth. While the \n\nUnited States is an important trade partner for European \n\neconomies, its market share for exports from the large EU \n\nMember States is in the single digits on average and there­\n\nfore relatively small compared to that of the Member States’ \n\ntrade partners within the EU (Box 2).\n\nThe outlook for the emerging economies remains favora­\n\nble, but the new US government is likely to increase trade \n\npolicy uncertainty. In addition to China, Mexico may be the \n\ncountry most affected by import tariffs. In China, the most \n\nrecent stimulus package is generating growth, although the \n\nAmerican import tariffs on Chinese products will weigh \n\n heavily on goods exports.\n\nIn 2024, advanced economies are projected to expand by \n\n1.8 percent and emerging economies by 4.7 percent. A growth \n\nrate of 3.7 percent is expected for the global economy in 2024, \n\nwhile growth of 3.6 and 3.7 percent is expected for 2025 and \n\n2026, respectively. The forecast for 2025 has been adjusted \n\ndownward by 0.1 percentage points. This moderate down­\n\nward correction results from the fact that the assumed trade \n\nbarriers are offset by more dynamic growth in the United \n\nStates (Table 1).\n\nDownward risks for the global economy have increased con­\n\nsiderably since the fall. Geopolitical risks remain quite high. \n\nFurther escalation in the Middle East could increase oil and \n\ngas prices even more. The war in Ukraine remains incalcu­\n\nlable, especially following Trump’s re-election, which has \n\nincreased economic and security policy risks overall. This \n\nforecast makes assumptions about future US trade and \n\nfiscal policy after Trump’s inauguration in January 2025 \n\n(Box 1). However, if there are considerably higher trade bar­\n\nriers than assumed in this forecast, there are likely to be \n\ngreater global economic fallouts (Box 2). A further risk fac­\n\ntor is public debt sustainability. In France, government bond \n\nyields have risen, as the resignation of French Prime Minister \n\nMichel Barnier has increased doubts about a reduction in \n\nthe debt burden.\n\n319\n\nDIW Weekly Report 50–52/2024\n\nGERMAN ECONOMY\n\nThe German economy continues to experience weak growth. \n\nIn addition to the ongoing global industrial slump, the eco­\n\nnomic structural change in Germany is having a noticeable \n\nimpact: Structural adaptation in the manufacturing indus­\n\ntry, for example to stronger international competition, has \n\nnow reached industry-related sectors such as business-re­\n\nlated services and are affecting the labor market. Companies \n\nin industry as well as those in industry-related sectors are \n\nresponding to the lack of orders not only by expanding short-\n\ntime work, but also by laying off some of their staff despite \n\nthe ongoing skilled worker shortage. Accordingly, unem­\n\nployment has increased again recently. While economic out­\n\nput increased slightly (by 0.1 percent) in the third quarter \n\nof 2024, this growth was preceded by a strong decline (by \n\n0.3 percent) in the second quarter (Figure 2).\n\nExports and investments in particular have declined again, \n\nlikely also due to structural reasons. Persistently weak for­\n\neign demand for local manufacturing products was also evi­\n\ndent in the third quarter: Exports dropped significantly, goods \n\nexports experienced a considerable slump. This in combina­\n\ntion with slightly positive imports resulted in a negative trade \n\nbalance. Thus, foreign trade depressed economic growth in \n\nGermany. Investments in equipment and construction were \n\nalso on the decline again.\n\nNonetheless, GDP increased slightly in the third quarter, \n\nwhich can be attributed to a moderate expansion of private \n\nconsumption on the one hand. However, as this growth fol­\n\nlowed a steep decline in the previous quarter, this cannot be \n\nconsidered a recovery. Taking into account stable inflation \n\nrates and sustained wage increases, which were once again \n\nstrong in the third quarter, the expansion of private con­\n\nsumption seems rather restrained. In light of the impending \n\nlayoffs at major industrial companies, many private house­\n\nholds are likely to be more concerned about their own jobs. \n\nIt seems that they are saving more money again out of cau­\n\ntion: The savings rate increased for the fourth quarter in a \n\nrow. On the other hand, inventories were expanded signif­\n\nicantly and supported economic development: Companies \n\nproduced more than was consumed, resulting in GDP being \n\nhigher than the sum of its components.\n\nExamining individual economic sectors makes it clear that \n\nthe crisis in German industry is worsening and noticeably \n\nimpacting other sectors. The gross value added of manu­\n\nfacturing as well as the construction sector have recently \n\ndeclined. It declined by 1.4 percent for manufacturing, con­\n\nsiderably more than expected in the fall. The gross value \n\nadded of some services, such as professional services firms, \n\nfinancial services and insurance providers, and information \n\nand communication services, declined. Strong growth in \n\npublic services and other service providers are keeping over­\n\nall gross value added from dipping into the red.\n\nThe re-election of Donald Trump and the collapse of the \n\nGerman government coalition at the beginning of November \n\ncreated further uncertainty about the economic policy frame­\n\nwork of the coming years, especially among companies. The \n\noutlook for foreign trade has worsened, as the Trump admin­\n\nistration will likely increase trade barriers significantly start­\n\ning in 2025. This forecast assumes that after Trump takes \n\noffice, he will reimpose 10-percent tariffs on steel and 25-per­\n\ncent tariffs on aluminum that had previously been repealed \n\nby current US President Joe Biden. Moreover, it assumes that \n\nthe tariff rate for Chinese exports to the United States will \n\nincrease by 10 percentage points. The average tariff rate on \n\ngoods imports from China to the United States will likely be \n\n30 percent instead of around 20 percent (Box 1).\n\nDomestically, there is still no federal budget for 2025 due to \n\nthe collapse of the government coalition and the snap elec­\n\ntion. Provisional budget management applies following the \n\ncollapse, under which expenditure may only be incurred \n\nFigure 2\n\nGrowth of real GDP in Germany\n\nIn billions of euros (left axis) and quarter-on-quarter in percent \n\n(right axis)\n\n \n\nNote: Forecast from the fourth quarter of 2024; adjusted for price, seasonal, and calendar effects.\n\nSources: National Statistical Offices; DIW Berlin Economic Outlook Winter 2024.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nThe German economy will experience steady growth once again from 2025.\n\nGerman economy still struggling to \n\nmake headway\n\n320\n\nDIW Weekly Report 50–52/2024\n\nGERMAN ECONOMY\n\nThe increased uncertainty is hitting the German economy \n\nin an already extremely difficult situation between cyclical \n\nweakness and structural change. Thus, another decline in \n\neconomic output is expected in the current fourth quarter \n\n(Table 2). Leading indicators from the beginning of the cur­\n\nrent quarter, i.e., before the US presidential election and the \n\ncollapse of the German government coalition caused addi­\n\ntional uncertainty, suggest that the industrial slump would \n\nhave continued regardless of the additional negative factors \n\nand that a recovery would have been delayed again. The \n\nGlobal Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index remained \n\nbelow the expansion threshold of 50 index points in October. \n\nIn November, the index declined again. While the index for \n\nindustry stagnated below the expansion threshold of 50, the \n\nindex for services fell below this threshold for the first time \n\nsince February. It should be noted that only some of the sur­\n\nveys took place following Trump’s re-election and the col­\n\nlapse of the German government coalition. The extent to \n\nwhich these political developments have further depressed \n\nsentiment will probably only become fully apparent in the \n\nDecember survey. Meanwhile, the order situation remains \n\nweak for both services as well as manufacturing. For exam­\n\nple, gross value added in the current fourth quarter is likely \n\nto decline slightly overall, yet slight increases in the ser­\n\nvice sectors will compensate for further declines in indus­\n\ntrial production.\n\nThe uncertainties due to foreign and domestic political devel­\n\nopments should result in companies acting more reserved in \n\nto “maintain existing institutions, legal obligations of the \n\nfederal government,”1 and for measures that have already \n\nbeen adopted. In addition, some fiscal policy support that \n\nhad already passed the Federal Cabinet but had not yet \n\nbeen approved by the Bundestag will no longer find a major­\n\nity under the current minority government. This support \n\nincludes measures aimed at stimulating investment, such \n\nas the extension of degressive depreciation rules, which were \n\nintroduced as part of the growth initiative announced in late \n\nsummer. Planned adjustments to the income tax rate to \n\neliminate bracket creep and the increase in the child allow­\n\nance and child benefit are also unlikely to happen for the \n\ntime being. This forecast assumes that a government will be \n\nformed and a budget resolution agreed upon in early sum­\n\nmer 2025, which will support the financial situation of the \n\nfederal ministries and agencies and thus government con­\n\nsumption. However, as new government plans and fiscal pol­\n\nicy measures cannot yet be known, fiscal policy will remain \n\nrestrictive for the time being.

The deteriorating external eco­\n\nnomic environment is also having an dampening impact on \n\nforeign trade as well as the willingness to invest. On the flip \n\nside, exports to the United States are expected to be pulled \n\nforward to the current and upcoming quarters, as the risk \n\nof steep tariff increases goes well beyond the reintroduction \n\nof aluminum and steel tariffs assumed in this forecast. The \n\ntemporary rise in exports should in turn boost imports of \n\nintermediary goods. Overall, foreign trade is expected to once \n\nagain make a negative contribution to GDP in this quarter.\n\nPrivate consumption should continue to develop weakly, \n\nbarely supporting economic development in the fourth quar­\n\nter. Job worries in particular are dampening private house­\n\nholds’ willingness to spend. This is reflected in the savings \n\nrate, which has been rising for four quarters. In addition, \n\nthe price level, which has become permanently higher, is \n\nslowing consumption despite rising real disposable income. \n\nConstruction investments in which residential construction \n\nlargely driven by private households plays a key role are likely \n\nto decline again.\n\nWe expect that the economic situation will relax very gradu­\n\nally over the further course of the forecast. From mid-2025, \n\nwith a new federal government and clearer external economic \n\nconditions, more and more uncertainties will dissipate and \n\nmake households and companies more confident again. The \n\nstabilization of employment over the course of 2025, which \n\nshould even grow somewhat in 2026 should also contribute \n\nto this. Accordingly, unemployment will gradually decline. \n\nAs a result, we expect that more of the higher disposable \n\nincomes and at least some of the household savings will \n\nbe spent again. Construction and equipment investments \n\nshould then stabilize, with the latter likely also being sup­\n\nported by government expenditure in 2025 in particular as a \n\npart of the Bundeswehr’s special fund. Companies will likely \n\nincreasingly invest in their production capacities beginning \n\nin 2026. As European industry increasingly recovers, foreign \n\ndemand will rise and the European Central Bank (ECB), as \n\nassumed, will cut interest rates further and German exports \n\nwill likely pick up speed again.\n\nWhile monetary policy will become increasingly less restric­\n\ntive due to further interest rate cuts over the course of the \n\nforecast period, fiscal policy will likely remain restrictive. On \n\nthe one hand, this is due to the expiry of expansionary meas­\n\nures in response to the energy crisis, the end of tax breaks, \n\nand tax increases. On the other hand, we assume that the col­\n\nlapse of the coalition will mean that revenue-reducing legis­\n\nlation will no longer be implemented, thus decreasing expan­\n\nsionary stimuli. Due to the snap elections for the German \n\nBundestag, the overall direction of fiscal policy during the \n\nforecast period is subject to a high degree of uncertainty.\n\nAll in all, price-adjusted GDP will likely contract by 0.2 per­\n\ncent in 2024 for the second year in a row (Table 3). In 2025, \n\nglobal economic output should expand by 0.2 percent, con­\n\nsiderably less than was expected in the fall. Growth will be \n\nstronger in 2026 at 1.2 percent. However, this will be in part \n\ndue to non-recurring effects such as a comparatively high \n\nnumber of work days. Thus, DIW Berlin is lowering its fore­\n\ncast for 2024 by 0.5 percentage points and for 2025 and 2026 \n\nby 0.7 and 0.2 percentage points, respectively. The signifi­\n\ncant downward revision in some cases is primarily due to the \n\nenormous additional burdens on the German economy due \n\nto the many uncertainties, both for companies as well as pri­\n\nvate households. With this forecast, DIW Berlin is revising \n\npotential GDP downward again. In 2029, potential growth \n\nof the German economy should still be 0.3 percent. Overall, \n\nthe output gap for 2024 and 2025 is likely to be a bit larger \n\nthan expected in fall. The gap will be −1.0 percent for 2024 \n\nand −0.9 percent for 2025. Over the course of the recovery, \n\nthe gap is expected to nearly close at −0.2 percent in 2026.\n\nFollowing the strong growth of previous years, average con­\n\nsumer price inflation should be 2.2 percent, primarily due \n\nto falling energy prices. This is close to the ECB’s two-per­\n\ncent target In the coming years, the inflation rate is expected \n\nto level off at two percent. Thus, DIW Berlin’s inflation fore­\n\ncast remains unchanged compared to the fall. The core rate \n\n(inflation excluding energy and food) should also decline fur­\n\nther and come closer to the inflation target, but more slowly \n\nthan the overall rate of inflation.\n\nThe downside risks for the German economy grew signifi­\n\ncantly larger in the fall. In particular, domestic and foreign \n\neconomic policy uncertainties pose a risk of real economic \n\ndistortions that could be significantly greater than assumed \n\nin this forecast. There could be delays in forming a govern­\n\nment and, accordingly, in the budget process, which would \n\nTable 3\n\nKey economic indicators for the German economy\n\n2023\n\n2024\n\n2025\n\n2026\n\nGDP1\n\n−0.3\n\n−0.2\n\n0.2\n\n1.2\n\nEmployment2 (1,000 persons)\n\n46,011\n\n46,106\n\n46,071\n\n46,120\n\nUnemployed (1,000 persons)\n\n2,609\n\n2,787\n\n2,854\n\n2,707\n\nUnemployment3 (BA concept, in percent)\n\n5.7\n\n6.0\n\n6.1\n\n5.8\n\nConsumer prices4\n\n5.9\n\n2.2\n\n2.0\n\n2.0\n\nUnit labor costs5\n\n6.7\n\n5.4\n\n3.1\n\n1.8\n\nGovernment budget balance6\n\nin billions of euros\n\n−107.5\n\n−108.6\n\n−92.8\n\n−82.7\n\nin percent of nominal GDP\n\n−2.6\n\n−2.5\n\n−2.1\n\n−1.8\n\nCurrent account balance\n\nin billions of euros\n\n248.7\n\n254.3\n\n223.4\n\n209.5\n\nin percent of nominal GDP\n\n5.9\n\n5.9\n\n5.1\n\n4.6\n\n1 Price adjusted.

The \n\ncontinuing lack of orders in manufacturing, increasing \n\ninternational competition, and sluggish developmen in \n\nindustry-related services are now affecting he labor mar­\n\nke and leading no only o short-time work bu o layoffs \n\ntoo, despite he continuing skilled worker shortage. While \n\nGDP increased slightly by 0.1 percen in he hird quarter \n\nof 2023, his growth was preceded by a stronger han \n\ninitially recorded decline in economic outpu of 0.3 percen \n\nin he second quarter. Thus, he German economy canno \n\nbe said o be on a stable growth path. In contrast, leading \n\nindicators sugges ha economic outpu will decline again \n\nin he fourth quarter, with overall growth for 2024 likely o \n\nbe 0.2 percent. This means ha he German economy will \n\ncontrac for he second year in a row.\n\nGerman industry in particular is experiencing a serious \n\ncrisis. Foreign rade may emporarily benefit, as many com­\n\npanies despite a lack of demand are expected o increase \n\ntheir exports o he United States in order o ge ahead of \n\nthe possible ariffs ha US President-elec Donald Trump \n\nannounced. However, impending protectionis measures \n\nare already having an impac and unse ling local compa­\n\nnies, which are herefore postponing investments further. \n\nIn addition, he economic framework conditions in Ger­\n\nmany are unclear and will remain unpredictable until a \n\nleas he spring when here is a new federal government. \n\nAll of hese factors in conjunction with increasing concerns \n\nabou heir own jobs are unse ling households in Ger­\n\nmany, resulting in private consumption failing o pick up \n\nspeed despite rising real wages.\n\nA gradual easing is no expected until mid-2025, when \n\ndomestic and foreign economic uncertainties will succes­\n\nsively lessen. Nevertheless, he German economy should \n\nexpand by 0.2 percen in 2025. Thus, DIW Berlin is revis­\n\ning its fall forecas downward by 0.7 percentage points. \n\nEconomic outpu is expected o increase by 1.2 percen in \n\n2026, although his is partially due o non-recurring effects \n\nsuch as a relatively high number of work days.\n\nIn regard o he global economy, he boom in he United \n\nStates will remain a key driver for now, compensating for \n\nthe sluggish recovery in many other advanced econo­\n\nmies as well as China. While he Chinese economy falters, \n\na gradual upswing is continuing in he euro area due o \n\nrising purchasing power and falling inflation. In 2024, he \n\nglobal economy is expected o grow by 3.7 percent, while \n\ni should grow by 3.6 percen and 3.7 percen in 2025 and \n\n2026, respectively.\n\n313\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 50–52/2024\n\nGLOBAL ECONOMY\n\nThe sustained boom in he United States is once again \n\ndetermining he expansion empo of he global economy in \n\n2024, compensating for he sluggish recovery in many other \n\nadvanced economies and China. Thus, he gap in economic \n\noutpu between he United States and other importan econ­\n\nomies such as he euro area is growing. Purchasing power \n\nhas recovered in he euro area and he United Kingdom and \n\nis supporting a gradual upturn here. The Chinese economy \n\nis faltering, meaning i will no reach its growth arge of five \n\npercen for 2024. Lastly, he economic and rade policies of \n\nUS President-elec Donald Trump are pu ing he global eco­\n\nnomic order o he est.\n\nGlobal economic growth has picked up speed recently: The \n\nglobal economy expanded by 0.8 percen in he hird quar­\n\nter of 2024 after growth of 0.7 percen in he second quarter \n\n(Figure 1). In he fall, global growth in he advanced econ­\n\nomies was primarily driven by a strong increase of 0.7 per­\n\ncen in he United States. Mos other advanced economies \n\nare continuing o recover a a moderate pace; for example, \n\nthe British and Japanese economies grew by only 0.1 and \n\n0.2 percent, respectively. The euro area, in contrast, contin­\n\nued its recovery, recording an increase of 0.4 percent. Spain \n\nand he Netherlands grew he mos by 0.8 percen each, \n\nfollowed by France by 0.4 percent. In contrast, Italy and \n\nGermany stagnated.\n\nThe economies of he Central and Southeastern EU coun­\n\ntries suffered from weak demand from Germany. In hese \n\ncountries, economic outpu declined by 0.2 percen in he \n\nthird quarter of 2024.

In contrast, growth of 0.9 percen in Brazil was \n\nweaker han in he previous quarter.\n\nDespite he expected geopolitical and rade policy cutbacks, \n\nthe global economy should expand slightly in he fourth quar­\n\nter of 2024, in par hanks o China’s increasingly strong eco­\n\nnomic growth. Mos advanced economies are losing momen­\n\ntum slightly, and he leading indicators deteriorated in he \n\nfall months. The slump in global industrial production con­\n\ntinues as well: The Purchasing Managers Indices for he \n\nUnited States and he euro area were ilted o he downside \n\nfrom May o September and recently moved sideways. The \n\npicture in he services sector appears o be mixed: While he \n\nUnited States experienced strong growth in November, he \n\nindices for he euro area fell below he expansion hreshold. \n\nIn October, he Purchasing Manager’s Index for manufac­\n\nturing in he United Kingdom dropped below 50, a rend \n\ntha continued into November. The index for Japanese man­\n\nufacturing is continuing its sideways movemen slightly \n\nbelow he expansion hreshold. In surveys, he newes polit­\n\nical developments, such as Trump’s re-election and he col­\n\nlapse of he German governmen coalition, were only par­\n\ntially reflected. However, hese events are likely o have led \n\nto increased uncertainty among firms and private house­\n\nholds alike abou future economic policy frameworks. The \n\nbigges uncertainties concern he future rade policy of he \n\nUnited States. To hedge agains his, companies will likely \n\npull orders forward, meaning ha exports o he United \n\nStates should initially be somewha stronger han expected. \n\nHowever, his will presumably no be reflected in he aggre­\n\ngated global economic output.\n\nWe expec growth in he United States in he fourth quarter \n\nof 2024 will continue o be strong, albei somewha weaker \n\nthan in he hird quarter, and supported by private consump­\n\ntion in particular.

In China, he outlook has improved \n\ndue o he recently announced monetary and fiscal policy \n\nmeasures, which has brightened economic sentiment.\n\nWe assume ha a less restrictive monetary policy will sup­\n\npor economic growth in he coming years. The central banks \n\nof many advanced economies will likely cu interes rates \n\nfurther in 2025. The inflation rate continues o be lower in \n\nmany places, which is mainly due o falling energy prices. \n\nInflation in he services sector remains high in many places. \n\nEmerging economies have initiated an interes rate urna­\n\nround earlier and may have reached he end of he inter­\n\nes rate cuts. For example, inflation in Mexico is proving \n\nto be more persisten han expected, and he Central Bank \n\nof Brazil recently raised interes rates again in response \n\nto higher core inflation. In contrast, he People's Bank of \n\nChina is following a loose monetary policy due o deflation­\n\nary endencies.\n\nFiscal policy is slightly expansionary in mos economies. In \n\nthe United Kingdom, he Labour governmen passed its fall \n\nbudget, ushering in an expansionary fiscal policy.

Assuming \n\ntha global rade barriers are ightened from 2025 onwards, \n\ninternational rade is likely o be stronger in he fourth quar­\n\nter of 2024, due o anticipated purchases . Therefore, overall \n\ngrowth of 1.2 percen is expected for 2024. Only a moderate \n\nupswing is expected for 2025 and 2026 due o likely ighter \n\ntrade barriers. Furthermore, industry’s ongoing weak growth \n\nshould continue o weigh on international rade before fall­\n\ning interes rates boos corporate investmen somewha a \n\nthe end of 2025 and suppor international rade.\n\nIn he coming years, he expected increase in rade barri­\n\ners is likely o slow global economic growth. This forecas \n\nassumes ha he US governmen will increase ariff rates on \n\nChinese goods imports by 10 percentage points, resulting in \n\nan average rate on Chinese exports of around 30 percent. A \n\nthe same ime, he forecas also assumes ha he aluminum \n\nand steel ariffs on he European Union, which had been sus­\n\npended by he Biden administration, will be reintroduced. \n\nIn reaction o he increase in US ariffs, i is assumed ha \n\nthe economies affected will ake argeted countermeasures, \n\nbu avoid an escalation. Due o ariff asymmetries, regions \n\nmay be affected differently.\n\nBox 1\n\nAssumptions and framework conditions\n\nAssumptions abou interes rates, exchange rates, \n\nand energy prices\n\nThis forecas is based on he following assumptions abou he \n\nfurther developmen of key interes rates, exchange rates, and \n\ncommodity prices (Table). These assumptions were made based \n\non previous developments, futures markets prices, and he clos­\n\ning prices on he date of his forecas (November 12, 2024). The \n\nEuropean Central Bank (ECB) decreased interes rates once again \n\nin October, hus continuing he path of normalization. For he win­\n\nter forecast, four further interes rate cuts of 25 basis points each \n\nare assumed for he deposi rate until spring 2025. The money \n\nmarke interes rates also fell in line with key interes rates. We \n\nexpec ha key interes rates will continue o fall until mid-2025 \n\nand hen remain a ha level. The ransmission of interes rate cuts \n\ninto he real economy is also beginning o show. For example, he \n\nrefinancing costs for households and firms began o decline in he \n\nsecond quarter of 2024, and his decline is likely o continue in line \n\nwith key interes rates. The yield on governmen bonds increased \n\nagain slightly in he fourth quarter of 2024. We assume ha cap­\n\nital marke interes rates will remain largely unchanged over he \n\nforecas horizon a 2.3 percen for Germany and 2.9 percen for he \n\neuro area. The euro has recently appreciated slightly agains he \n\nUS dollar. For he forecas period, i is assumed ha he exchange \n\nrate of EUR o USD will remain a 1.07 USD per EUR, he level \n\nreached a he end of he data period. According o futures, he \n\nprice for Bren oil should increase slightly in he coming months \n\nbefore declining again a he star of 2025 until he end of he \n\nforecas period. In 2024, he average price should be 81 USD per \n\nbarrel before declining o an average of 73 USD per barrel in 2025 \n\nand finally o 71 USD per barrel in 2026. The wholesale price for \n\ngas (TTF) rose over he course of 2024 and should be 34 euros per \n\nmegawa hour on average. Over he forecas horizon, we assume \n\ntha he prices will increase o 40 euros in 2025 before falling o \n\n34 euros per megawa hour in 2026.\n\nGeopolitical and rade policy assumptions\n\nAdditionally, he forecas assumes ha here will be no further es­\n\ncalation in he war in Ukraine. In he Middle East, an easing of en­\n\nsions is becoming increasingly less likely. The fall of former Syrian \n\nPresiden Bashar al-Assad is causing uncertainty and could lead o \n\nhigher oil and gas prices. In addition, his forecas assumes ha US \n\nPresident-elec Trump will implemen some of he rade ariffs he \n\nhas announced. I is assumed ha he American governmen will \n\nincrease ariff rates by 10 percentage points for all goods imported \n\nfrom China in he firs quarter of 2025. As a result, he average \n\ntariff rate on Chinese goods, which is currently around 20 percent, \n\nwould increase again by half o around 30 percen (including \n\nautomotive ariffs and 100-percen ariffs on e-cars). The ariffs on \n\nEuropean Union aluminum and steel, which had been suspended, \n\nwill be implemented again (10 percen for aluminum and 25 per­\n\ncen for steel). Furthermore, rade partners will presumably forego \n\nbroad countermeasures and only reac with retaliatory ariffs on \n\nspecific groups of goods.\n\nTable\n\nForecas assumptions\n\n2023\n\n2024\n\n2025\n\n2026\n\nECB deposi rate1 (year end)\n\nPercent\n\n4.0\n\n3.0\n\n2.25\n\n2.25\n\nMoney marke interes rate\n\nThree-month EURIBOR in percent\n\n3.4\n\n3.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.0\n\nCapital marke interest\n\nYield on euro-area governmen bonds \n\nwith a remaining erm of 10 years\n\n3.3\n\n3.0\n\n2.9\n\n2.9\n\nCapital marke interest\n\nYield on German governmen bonds \n\nwith a remaining erm of 10 years\n\n2.6\n\n2.4\n\n2.3\n\n2.3\n\nExchange rate\n\nUSD/EUR\n\n1.08\n\n1.08\n\n1.06\n\n1.06\n\nCrude oil price\n\nUSD per barrel\n\n82.5\n\n80.3\n\n72.9\n\n70.9\n\nGas price\n\nEUR per megawa hour\n\n42.1\n\n34.1\n\n40.4\n\n34.2\n\n1 The ECB is currently steering he economy via he deposi facility, no he main refinancing rate (key interes \n\nrate).\n\nNote: Annual average values; ECB deposi facility values a he end of he year.\n\nSources: European Central Bank; European Money Markets Institute (EMMI); Eurex Exchange; Deutsche Bundes-\n\nbank; Federal Reserve; Energy Information Administration (EIA); Intercontinental Exchange (ICE); CME Group; \n\nDIW Berlin Economic Forecas Winter 2024.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\n316\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 50–52/2024\n\nGLOBAL ECONOMY\n\nBox 2\n\nTrump reloaded: Expected American rade policy\n\nMajority of ariff announcements likely o function as \n\nbargaining chips\n\nAn increase in protectionis measures in he United States is ex­\n\npected over he forecas horizon. President-elec Donald Trump \n\nhas made contradictory and sometimes extreme announcements \n\nabou ariff increases. I is likely ha Trump will continue he rade \n\npolicy of his firs erm and ha he hrea of additional impor ariffs \n\nwill primarily serve as a means of exerting pressure in bilateral \n\nnegotiations, with ariffs likely o be implemented only partially. \n\nConcretely, his forecas assumes ha following Trump’s inaugu­\n\nration, ariffs on Chinese goods will increase by 10 percent1 and \n\nthe ariffs on European Union aluminum and steel, which were \n\nsuspended by he Biden administration (10 percen for aluminum \n\nand 25 percen for steel), will be reimplemented. Furthermore, he \n\nUnited States’ rade partners will presumably avoid broad counter­\n\nmeasures and only reac with retaliatory ariffs on specific groups \n\nof goods.\n\nAlthough Trump announced further drastic measures such as \n\nuniversal impor ariffs of 10 or 20 percen during his election \n\ncampaign, hese would have considerable economic and polit­\n\nical implications if implemented. On he one hand, ariffs of his \n\nmagnitude would considerably increase he prices of imported \n\ngoods and hus create strong inflation, potentially accompanied \n\nby supply chain disruptions and a supply shortage in he United \n\nStates.2 This is likely o be me with considerable resistance from \n\nthe public as well as from industry. For example, a study has shown \n\ntha high inflation rates considerably decrease approval of he \n\nreigning government.3 In addition, a sharp increase in impor ariffs \n\ncould destabilize he stock markets, as indicated by he recen \n\ndrop in shares of he car manufacturers General Motors and Ford \n\nfollowing Trump’s announcements of ariffs on Mexican imports. \n\nFinally, here are legal hurdles which, despite he US President’s \n\nfar-reaching powers, are likely o make an escalation in rade spol­\n\nicy more difficult.\n\nIf all ariffs actually are implemented, hey will cause \n\nsignifican real economic distortions\n\nNevertheless, here is grea uncertainty regarding hese assump­\n\ntions and i seems possible ha considerably comprehensive pro­\n\ntectionis measures will be implemented. Drastic impor ariffs are \n\nno only justified as a means of obtaining concessions from rade \n\npartners, bu also as a means of generating public revenue as well \n\n1 \n\nCf.

Although hese \n\njustifications are no empirically sound, hey could poin o he \n\nactual implementation of more far-reaching ariffs.\n\nFor example, Trump has repeatedly announced universal impor \n\ntariffs of 10 percen and ariffs on Chinese imports of 60 percent. \n\nThis would be a drastic break from previous American rade pol­\n\nicy; for example, he average effective ariff rate in 2023 was only \n\n3.8 percent. Such a massive ightening of rade policy would also \n\nhave very negative economic consequences for he United States. \n\nFor example, model calculations4 show ha implementing univer­\n\nsal impor ariffs of 10 percen withou rade policy reactions would \n\nreduce US production by 0.4 percentage points by he end of he \n\nforecas horizon. In he year of he ariff increase, inflation would be \n\n0.6 percentage points higher. \n\nThe Federal Reserve would likely respond o his strong price \n\npressure with a restrictive course, which would dampen domestic \n\neconomic activity. In he long erm, comprehensive ariffs are also \n\nlikely o weaken he competitiveness of he US economy due o \n\nhigher production costs and he shifting of resources o less pro­\n\nductive sectors.5 The United States’ rade partners could respond \n\nwith broad retaliatory ariffs, which could rigger a rade war and \n\nfurther destabilize international rade relations. Positive effects of \n\nthe impor ariffs on he US economy will likely be limited. For ex­\n\nample, a study6 shows ha he ariffs during Trump’s firs erm did \n\nno create any jobs in ariffed sectors. On he contrary, he result­\n\ning counter ariffs imposed by China were economically costly for \n\nthe United States7 and negatively affected employmen levels.8 \n\nA he same ime, he ariffs would no reduce he rade deficit,9 \n\npartly due o an expected appreciation of he US dollar, which \n\nmakes exports more expensive and imports cheaper.\n\nThe global economy would also be hi hard by such a comprehen­\n\nsive increase in US ariffs. For example, exports will decline and \n\nproduction will fall in he res of he world, while a he same ime \n\ngoods imported from he United States will become more expen­\n\nsive due o a likely appreciation of he US dollar. The negative con­\n\nsequences for individual countries will likely depend on he ariff \n\namoun and he country’s dependency on he United States as a \n\ntrade partner.

The economic \n\nconsequences of he ariffs may hus be rather limited overall, bu \n\nthere are significan regional differences. A study10 investigated \n\npossible consequences of a universal impor ariff of 10 percent, \n\n60 percen on Chinese imports, and 100 percen on all imported \n\ncars. According o he model calculations in he study, he EU’s \n\nGDP is expected o decline by around 0.11 percent.11 \n\nGermany’s economy, in contrast, would be hi even harder; impos­\n\ning impor ariffs on cars would severely affec German industry.12 \n\nIn addition, he United States is he mos importan individual \n\nsales marke for German pharmaceutical companies. If US gas \n\nexports o he EU are used as a means of political pressure, \n\nthere is also he risk ha energy prices will rise again. This would \n\nlikely further burden he beleaguered manufacturing industry in \n\nGermany in particular. However, Germany could benefi from ariff \n\nasymmetries and rade diversification, which may somewha com­\n\npensate for he negative effects; an escalation of he rade conflic \n\nbetween he United States and China ha entails significantly \n\nhigher ariffs on both rade partners would make German products \n\nrelatively more affordable. A he same ime, he ariff policy may \n\nlead o more diversification of rade relationships with other coun­\n\ntries,13 which could further increase demand for German products.\n\nWith a share of around 15 percen of otal expor volume in 2023, \n\nthe United States is China’s mos importan rade partner. An in­\n\ncrease in ariffs on all imported Chinese goods o 60 percen would \n\nhi he Chinese economy hard and lead o distortions in interna­\n\ntional rade. A he same ime, China may, as in 2018, ake counter­\n\nmeasures, which would likely strengthen he effect. During he firs \n\nTrump administration, he counter ariffs were around he amoun \n\nof he American ariffs, which avoided an escalation.\n\nTariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods could resul in significan \n\neconomic losses for both countries.

While a pro­\n\ntectionis rade policy and restrictive immigration policy will \n\nlead o price pressure, falling energy prices will likely dampen \n\nthis pressure in he forecas period. Continued strong con­\n\nsumption should contribute o growth, supported by house­\n\nholds’ good financial situation, a solid labor market, and \n\nplanned ax relief for private households under he new gov­\n\nernment. Corporate investments will likely suppor growth \n\nas well, driven by be er financing conditions, he recovery \n\nof he real estate sector, and an expected decrease in he cor­\n\nporate income ax.\n\nThe euro area economy should expand further in 2025 and \n\n2026 due o strong domestic demand as a resul of rising real \n\nwages (Figure 2). The effects of US ariffs as assumed in his \n\nforecas should only marginally hamper growth. While he \n\nUnited States is an importan rade partner for European \n\neconomies, its marke share for exports from he large EU \n\nMember States is in he single digits on average and here­\n\nfore relatively small compared o ha of he Member States’ \n\ntrade partners within he EU (Box 2).\n\nThe outlook for he emerging economies remains favora­\n\nble, bu he new US governmen is likely o increase rade \n\npolicy uncertainty. In addition o China, Mexico may be he \n\ncountry mos affected by impor ariffs. In China, he mos \n\nrecen stimulus package is generating growth, although he \n\nAmerican impor ariffs on Chinese products will weigh \n\n heavily on goods exports.\n\nIn 2024, advanced economies are projected o expand by \n\n1.8 percen and emerging economies by 4.7 percent. A growth \n\nrate of 3.7 percen is expected for he global economy in 2024, \n\nwhile growth of 3.6 and 3.7 percen is expected for 2025 and \n\n2026, respectively. The forecas for 2025 has been adjusted \n\ndownward by 0.1 percentage points. This moderate down­\n\nward correction results from he fac ha he assumed rade \n\nbarriers are offse by more dynamic growth in he United \n\nStates (Table 1).\n\nDownward risks for he global economy have increased con­\n\nsiderably since he fall. Geopolitical risks remain quite high. \n\nFurther escalation in he Middle Eas could increase oil and \n\ngas prices even more. The war in Ukraine remains incalcu­\n\nlable, especially following Trump’s re-election, which has \n\nincreased economic and security policy risks overall. This \n\nforecas makes assumptions abou future US rade and \n\nfiscal policy after Trump’s inauguration in January 2025 \n\n(Box 1). However, if here are considerably higher rade bar­\n\nriers han assumed in his forecast, here are likely o be \n\ngreater global economic fallouts (Box 2). A further risk fac­\n\ntor is public deb sustainability. In France, governmen bond \n\nyields have risen, as he resignation of French Prime Minister \n\nMichel Barnier has increased doubts abou a reduction in \n\nthe deb burden.\n\n319\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 50–52/2024\n\nGERMAN ECONOMY\n\nThe German economy continues o experience weak growth. \n\nIn addition o he ongoing global industrial slump, he eco­\n\nnomic structural change in Germany is having a noticeable \n\nimpact: Structural adaptation in he manufacturing indus­\n\ntry, for example o stronger international competition, has \n\nnow reached industry-related sectors such as business-re­\n\nlated services and are affecting he labor market. Companies \n\nin industry as well as hose in industry-related sectors are \n\nresponding o he lack of orders no only by expanding short-\n\ntime work, bu also by laying off some of heir staff despite \n\nthe ongoing skilled worker shortage. Accordingly, unem­\n\nploymen has increased again recently. While economic out­\n\npu increased slightly (by 0.1 percent) in he hird quarter \n\nof 2024, his growth was preceded by a strong decline (by \n\n0.3 percent) in he second quarter (Figure 2).\n\nExports and investments in particular have declined again, \n\nlikely also due o structural reasons. Persistently weak for­\n\neign demand for local manufacturing products was also evi­\n\nden in he hird quarter: Exports dropped significantly, goods \n\nexports experienced a considerable slump. This in combina­\n\ntion with slightly positive imports resulted in a negative rade \n\nbalance. Thus, foreign rade depressed economic growth in \n\nGermany. Investments in equipmen and construction were \n\nalso on he decline again.\n\nNonetheless, GDP increased slightly in he hird quarter, \n\nwhich can be a ributed o a moderate expansion of private \n\nconsumption on he one hand. However, as his growth fol­\n\nlowed a steep decline in he previous quarter, his canno be \n\nconsidered a recovery. Taking into accoun stable inflation \n\nrates and sustained wage increases, which were once again \n\nstrong in he hird quarter, he expansion of private con­\n\nsumption seems rather restrained. In ligh of he impending \n\nlayoffs a major industrial companies, many private house­\n\nholds are likely o be more concerned abou heir own jobs. \n\nI seems ha hey are saving more money again ou of cau­\n\ntion: The savings rate increased for he fourth quarter in a \n\nrow. On he other hand, inventories were expanded signif­\n\nicantly and supported economic development: Companies \n\nproduced more han was consumed, resulting in GDP being \n\nhigher han he sum of its components.\n\nExamining individual economic sectors makes i clear ha \n\nthe crisis in German industry is worsening and noticeably \n\nimpacting other sectors. The gross value added of manu­\n\nfacturing as well as he construction sector have recently \n\ndeclined. I declined by 1.4 percen for manufacturing, con­\n\nsiderably more han expected in he fall. The gross value \n\nadded of some services, such as professional services firms, \n\nfinancial services and insurance providers, and information \n\nand communication services, declined. Strong growth in \n\npublic services and other service providers are keeping over­\n\nall gross value added from dipping into he red.\n\nThe re-election of Donald Trump and he collapse of he \n\nGerman governmen coalition a he beginning of November \n\ncreated further uncertainty abou he economic policy frame­\n\nwork of he coming years, especially among companies. The \n\noutlook for foreign rade has worsened, as he Trump admin­\n\nistration will likely increase rade barriers significantly start­\n\ning in 2025. This forecas assumes ha after Trump akes \n\noffice, he will reimpose 10-percen ariffs on steel and 25-per­\n\ncen ariffs on aluminum ha had previously been repealed \n\nby curren US Presiden Joe Biden. Moreover, i assumes ha \n\nthe ariff rate for Chinese exports o he United States will \n\nincrease by 10 percentage points. The average ariff rate on \n\ngoods imports from China o he United States will likely be \n\n30 percen instead of around 20 percen (Box 1).\n\nDomestically, here is still no federal budge for 2025 due o \n\nthe collapse of he governmen coalition and he snap elec­\n\ntion. Provisional budge managemen applies following he \n\ncollapse, under which expenditure may only be incurred \n\nFigure 2\n\nGrowth of real GDP in Germany\n\nIn billions of euros (lef axis) and quarter-on-quarter in percen \n\n(righ axis)\n\n \n\nNote: Forecas from he fourth quarter of 2024; adjusted for price, seasonal, and calendar effects.\n\nSources: National Statistical Offices; DIW Berlin Economic Outlook Winter 2024.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nThe German economy will experience steady growth once again from 2025.\n\nGerman economy still struggling o \n\nmake headway\n\n320\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 50–52/2024\n\nGERMAN ECONOMY\n\nThe increased uncertainty is hi ing he German economy \n\nin an already extremely difficul situation between cyclical \n\nweakness and structural change. Thus, another decline in \n\neconomic outpu is expected in he curren fourth quarter \n\n(Table 2). Leading indicators from he beginning of he cur­\n\nren quarter, i.e., before he US presidential election and he \n\ncollapse of he German governmen coalition caused addi­\n\ntional uncertainty, sugges ha he industrial slump would \n\nhave continued regardless of he additional negative factors \n\nand ha a recovery would have been delayed again. The \n\nGlobal Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index remained \n\nbelow he expansion hreshold of 50 index points in October. \n\nIn November, he index declined again. While he index for \n\nindustry stagnated below he expansion hreshold of 50, he \n\nindex for services fell below his hreshold for he firs ime \n\nsince February. I should be noted ha only some of he sur­\n\nveys ook place following Trump’s re-election and he col­\n\nlapse of he German governmen coalition. The exten o \n\nwhich hese political developments have further depressed \n\nsentimen will probably only become fully apparen in he \n\nDecember survey. Meanwhile, he order situation remains \n\nweak for both services as well as manufacturing. For exam­\n\nple, gross value added in he curren fourth quarter is likely \n\nto decline slightly overall, ye sligh increases in he ser­\n\nvice sectors will compensate for further declines in indus­\n\ntrial production.\n\nThe uncertainties due o foreign and domestic political devel­\n\nopments should resul in companies acting more reserved in \n\nto “maintain existing institutions, legal obligations of he \n\nfederal government,”1 and for measures ha have already \n\nbeen adopted. In addition, some fiscal policy suppor ha \n\nhad already passed he Federal Cabine bu had no ye \n\nbeen approved by he Bundestag will no longer find a major­\n\nity under he curren minority government. This suppor \n\nincludes measures aimed a stimulating investment, such \n\nas he extension of degressive depreciation rules, which were \n\nintroduced as par of he growth initiative announced in late \n\nsummer. Planned adjustments o he income ax rate o \n\neliminate bracke creep and he increase in he child allow­\n\nance and child benefi are also unlikely o happen for he \n\ntime being. This forecas assumes ha a governmen will be \n\nformed and a budge resolution agreed upon in early sum­\n\nmer 2025, which will suppor he financial situation of he \n\nfederal ministries and agencies and hus governmen con­\n\nsumption. However, as new governmen plans and fiscal pol­\n\nicy measures canno ye be known, fiscal policy will remain \n\nrestrictive for he ime being. Due o uncertainties abou a \n\nnew government’s economic policy orientation, companies \n\nlocated in Germany in particular are likely o ac carefully. \n\nThus, investmen decisions are likely o be delayed o 2025.\n\n1 \n\nThe legal basis for provisional budge managemen is Article 111 of he Basic Law. The erm \n\n“institutions” includes constitutional bodies, federal agencies, institutions, and construction facil­\n\nities, for example.

The deteriorating external eco­\n\nnomic environmen is also having an dampening impac on \n\nforeign rade as well as he willingness o invest. On he flip \n\nside, exports o he United States are expected o be pulled \n\nforward o he curren and upcoming quarters, as he risk \n\nof steep ariff increases goes well beyond he reintroduction \n\nof aluminum and steel ariffs assumed in his forecast. The \n\ntemporary rise in exports should in urn boos imports of \n\nintermediary goods. Overall, foreign rade is expected o once \n\nagain make a negative contribution o GDP in his quarter.\n\nPrivate consumption should continue o develop weakly, \n\nbarely supporting economic developmen in he fourth quar­\n\nter. Job worries in particular are dampening private house­\n\nholds’ willingness o spend. This is reflected in he savings \n\nrate, which has been rising for four quarters. In addition, \n\nthe price level, which has become permanently higher, is \n\nslowing consumption despite rising real disposable income. \n\nConstruction investments in which residential construction \n\nlargely driven by private households plays a key role are likely \n\nto decline again.\n\nWe expec ha he economic situation will relax very gradu­\n\nally over he further course of he forecast. From mid-2025, \n\nwith a new federal governmen and clearer external economic \n\nconditions, more and more uncertainties will dissipate and \n\nmake households and companies more confiden again. The \n\nstabilization of employmen over he course of 2025, which \n\nshould even grow somewha in 2026 should also contribute \n\nto his. Accordingly, unemploymen will gradually decline. \n\nAs a result, we expec ha more of he higher disposable \n\nincomes and a leas some of he household savings will \n\nbe spen again. Construction and equipmen investments \n\nshould hen stabilize, with he la er likely also being sup­\n\nported by governmen expenditure in 2025 in particular as a \n\npar of he Bundeswehr’s special fund. Companies will likely \n\nincreasingly inves in heir production capacities beginning \n\nin 2026. As European industry increasingly recovers, foreign \n\ndemand will rise and he European Central Bank (ECB), as \n\nassumed, will cu interes rates further and German exports \n\nwill likely pick up speed again.\n\nWhile monetary policy will become increasingly less restric­\n\ntive due o further interes rate cuts over he course of he \n\nforecas period, fiscal policy will likely remain restrictive. On \n\nthe one hand, his is due o he expiry of expansionary meas­\n\nures in response o he energy crisis, he end of ax breaks, \n\nand ax increases. On he other hand, we assume ha he col­\n\nlapse of he coalition will mean ha revenue-reducing legis­\n\nlation will no longer be implemented, hus decreasing expan­\n\nsionary stimuli. Due o he snap elections for he German \n\nBundestag, he overall direction of fiscal policy during he \n\nforecas period is subjec o a high degree of uncertainty.\n\nAll in all, price-adjusted GDP will likely contrac by 0.2 per­\n\ncen in 2024 for he second year in a row (Table 3). In 2025, \n\nglobal economic outpu should expand by 0.2 percent, con­\n\nsiderably less han was expected in he fall. Growth will be \n\nstronger in 2026 a 1.2 percent. However, his will be in par \n\ndue o non-recurring effects such as a comparatively high \n\nnumber of work days. Thus, DIW Berlin is lowering its fore­\n\ncas for 2024 by 0.5 percentage points and for 2025 and 2026 \n\nby 0.7 and 0.2 percentage points, respectively. The signifi­\n\ncan downward revision in some cases is primarily due o he \n\nenormous additional burdens on he German economy due \n\nto he many uncertainties, both for companies as well as pri­\n\nvate households. With his forecast, DIW Berlin is revising \n\npotential GDP downward again. In 2029, potential growth \n\nof he German economy should still be 0.3 percent. Overall, \n\nthe outpu gap for 2024 and 2025 is likely o be a bi larger \n\nthan expected in fall. The gap will be −1.0 percen for 2024 \n\nand −0.9 percen for 2025. Over he course of he recovery, \n\nthe gap is expected o nearly close a −0.2 percen in 2026.\n\nFollowing he strong growth of previous years, average con­\n\nsumer price inflation should be 2.2 percent, primarily due \n\nto falling energy prices.
