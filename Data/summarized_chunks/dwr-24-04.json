This Weekly Repor provides an overview of he short- and long-term goals as well as curren developments and rends in France’s energy and climate policy. I reveals tha France is largely on rack with its greenhouse",
    "gases targets and is also making good progress on installing hea pumps. However, its expansion of renewable energy capac­ ities is falling short. Differences in he energy policies of France and Germany are mos apparen in he power sector: While France is prioritizing nuclear power, Germany is relying heavily on renewable energy. For France o achieve its climate goals, i will have o expand renewable energy faster. One challenge faced by both countries is heir planned electrifica­ tion of mobility and space heating. France’s energy policy is currently undergoing an update process. A new climate bill for he nex five years is o be adopted in he coming months. A strategy paper, relevan for future planning in he energy sector, was published a the end of November 2023 and opened o public consulta­ tion (Box). This Weekly Repor outlines he energy policy goals and measures of he French governmen and com­ pares hem with progress made so far using selected indi­ cators. I also highlights he individual similarities and dif­ ferences with he energy ransition in Germany.1 Mixed results for overarching goals so far As with Germany, France’s energy and climate policy goals are geared o European requirements. Implementation of the European Fi for 55 package2 is particularly importan here. I includes more ambitious argets for reducing green­ house gas emissions and increasing he share of renewable energy in Europe.3 Greenhouse gas emissions argets are currently being mostly met A he European level, he goal is o make he EU climate neutral by 2050. In addition, according o he lates revised targets, ne greenhouse gas emissions4 mus now be reduced to 55 percen of 1990 levels by 2030.5 In France, he goal of becoming climate neutral by 2050 has been enshrined in 1 On he German energy ransition, see Wolf-Peter Schill, Alexander Roth, and Adeline Guéret, “Ampel-Monitor Energiewende shows he pace of he energy ransition mus be accelerated signif­ icantly,” DIW Weekly Report, no. 27 (2022): 371–379 (available online; accessed on January 8, 2024.

Box Legislative framework for he energy ransition in France A cornerstone of he legislative framework for he energy ransi­ tion in France is he ac on he energy ransition for green growth (Loi relative à la ransition énergétique pour la croissance verte1) from Augus 17, 2015. This law was passed in he run-up o he UN Climate Change Conference (COP21) ha ook place in Paris in December 2015. This ac made i mandatory among other hings, for he French governmen o develop a national decarbonization strategy (Stratégie Nationale Bas Carbone,2 SNBC) for he firs time as well as a multi-annual energy program (Programmation Pluriannuelle de l’Énergie,3 PPE). Both programs contain quanti­ tative argets for a series of subsectors. They are intended o help France reduce its greenhouse gas emissions, become more ener­ gy efficient, and increase its share of renewable energy. The decarbonization strategy (SNBC) sets ou a long-term goal for greenhouse gas emissions and short-term emissions budgets for three successive five-year periods. These budgets se upper limits for otal greenhouse gas emissions ha may no be exceeded in the respective period. The strategy mus be revised every five years, whereby one par of he upper limi se in he previous strat­ egy mus be amended and a new upper limi proposed for he nex five-year period. The firs SNBC se an emissions limi for he peri­ ods from 2015 o 2018,4 from 2019 o 2023, and from 2024 o 2028. The second SNBC revised he upper limi se for he period from 2019 o 2023 and from 2024 o 2028, and introduced a new upper limi for he period from 2029 o 2033. The hird SNBC should cur­ rently being drafted by he government. The multi-annual energy program (PPE) is based on a similar principle. I sets ou plans for wo five-year periods and is reviewed 1 Légifrance, Loi no 2015-992 du 17 aoû 2015 relative à la ransition énergétique pour la croissance verte, 2022 (available online). 2 Ministère de la Transition écologique e solidaire, Stratégie Nationale Bas Carbone (2020) (available online). 3 Ministère",
    "de la Transition écologique e solidaire, Programmation Pluriannuelle de l’Energie (2020) (available online). 4 The firs SNBC was revised from 2018 o 2019 due o he adoption of he Energy and Climate Ac and he new climate neutrality arget. As a result, he firs budge only covers four years instead of five. every five years. I sets argets specifically for he energy sector, with a lower and an upper arge value being defined in each case. Some provisions of he ac from 2015 were amended by he Energy and Climate Act5 of November 8, 2019.6 Since hen, i has represented another cornerstone of France’s energy and environmental policy. In particular, i led o he governmen being mandated o pass a law every five years (Loi de programmation quinquennale sur l'économie e le climat), which sets ou in detail the argets and priorities of its energy and climate policy for he nex five years. The firs five-year law should have been adopted by July 1, 2023,7 bu he governmen did no mee his deadline. The new French energy and climate strategy (SFEC)8 was pub­ lished only on November 22, 2023. This strategy contains, among other hings, quantitative argets ha are likely o be included in he nex multi-annual energy program (PPE3). A he end of December, he firs draf version of he energy sovereignty ac was published, which is intended o serve as he energy block of he previously mentioned firs five-year law.9 After Presiden Emmanuel Macron was re-elected in May 2022, two differen ministries were responsible for energy and envi­ ronmental issues: The Ministry for he Energy Transition and the Ministry of Ecological Transition and Territorial Cohesion. In addition, a General Secretaria for Ecological Planning was se up, which reports directly o he Prime Minister. After he governmen reshuffle on January 9, 2024, he Ministry for he Energy Transition was suppressed , and he energy portfolio was ransferred o he Ministry of Economy and Finance. 5 Légifrance, Loi no 2019-1147 du 8 novembre 2019 relative à l’énergie e au clima (2019) ( available online). 6 The objectives and provisions provided for in he various energy-related laws are summarised in he French Energy Code. If a law amends certain objectives ha were provided for in a previous law, he corresponding article of he Energy Code is amended (available online). 7 Légifrance, Article L100-1 A of he French Energy Code (2023) (available online) 8 Ministère de la Transition Énergétique, Stratégie Française pour l’Energie e le Clima (2023) (available online) 9 Thomas Chemel, “Commen l’avant-proje de loi de souveraineté énergétique détricote les objectifs climatiques,” Contexte, January 4, 2024 (available online). 34 DIW Weekly Repor 4+5/2024 FRENCH ENERGY TRANSITION per year.8 This corresponds o around 6.5 ons per person. This is considerably less han in Germany, whose emissions amounted o around nine ons per capita in 2022. Between 2020 and 2022, gross emissions in France remained below the emissions budget. However, hese findings should be interpreted with caution since both he COVID-19 pandemic and",
    "he energy price crisis occurred in his period, which led to a significan reduction in energy consumption and here­ fore emissions. Furthermore, ne greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 and 2021 were above he indicative yearly limits set. This is due o, among other hings, he fac ha he reduc­ tion in greenhouse gases from forestry was less han planned. Overall, ne emissions in France were herefore slightly above the arge in he period from 2015 o 2021 (more recen data is no ye available).9 8 Ministère de la Transition Énergétique, Ajustemen echnique des budgets carbone (2022) (available online). 9 Hau Conseil pour le Clima (HCC), Rappor annuel (2023): 65 (available online). The decarbonization strategy (SNBC) also contains an esti­ mate of emissions budgets by sector, which are consisten with he overall five-year budget. However, his breakdown is only indicative. One sector can emi more if his is off­ se by a greater reduction in emissions in another sector, as long as he overall budge is respected. In contrast, Germany has so far had argets for each sector. However, he curren draf amendmen o he Climate Protection Ac will allow only one overall arge o apply in future, similar o France.10 With around 129 million ons of CO2 equivalen per year for he period from 2019 o 2023, he ranspor sector has the larges emissions budget. I is historically also he sec­ tor ha has produced he mos emissions.

The energy sec­ tor is he sector with he second-lowes emissions budge after waste.11 The buildings and ranspor sectors will have to reduce heir emissions he most: by around 45 and 30 per­ cen respectively when comparing 2019 levels o he 2029– 2033 period. Sectoral emissions and sectoral argets in France differ greatly from hose in Germany. In Germany, energy has traditionally accounted for he highes share of otal emis­ sions, which is primarily due o he high level of coal-fired power generation. I is followed by industry, as Germany has a particularly large amoun of energy-intensive industry, and then by he ranspor and buildings sectors. The implementation of new European argets for reduc­ ing ne greenhouse gas emissions of a leas 55 percen by 2030 will lead o",
    "a downward correction of France’s emis­ sions budgets for he years 2024 o 2028 and for 2029 o 2034. The Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan for France,12 which was submi ed o he European Commission for review in October 2023, sets ou an average emissions budge for he period from 2024 o 2028 (2029 o 2034), which is six percen (14 percent) lower han in he curren decar­ bonization strategy. Renewable energy share oo low The European Renewable Energy Directive from 2009 con­ tained binding argets for he share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption for all Member States for the year 2020. The arge for France was 23 percent, while for Germany i was 18 percent. However, France only achieved 19.2 percen and, as a result, was he only country in he EU to miss its arge for 2020 (Figure 2).13 The mos importan renewable energy sources in France are renewable solid biomass and residential waste used for hea generation (32 percen of renewable gross final energy con­ sumption in 2022), followed by hydroelectric power (18 per­ cent). Hea pumps, wind power, and biofuels each accoun for around en o 14 percen of gross final energy consump­ tion from renewable energy sources.14 In Germany, biomass for hea generation has a similar share of energy supply from renewable energy sources as i does in France; in contrast, he 11 Ministère de la Transition Énergétique, Ajustemen echnique des budgets carbone (2022) (available online). 12 European Commission, France – Draf Updated NECP 2021–2030 (2023) (available online). 13 Ministère de la Transition Écologique e de la Cohésion des Territoires, Service des données e études statistiques, “Les énergies renouvelables en France en 2022 – Suivi de la directive (UE) 2018/2001 relative à la promotion de l’utilisation des énergies renouvelables,” (2023) (available online); and European Commission, “Assessmen of he draf updated National Energy and Climate Plan of France,” 3 (2023) (available online). 14 Ministère de la Transition Écologique e de la Cohésion des Territoires, Service des données e études statistiques, “Les énergies renouvelables en France en 2022 – Suivi de la directive (UE) 2018/2001 relative à la promotion de l’utilisation des énergies renouvelables,” (2023) (available online). share of wind and solar energy in Germany is much higher and he share of hydroelectric power is significantly lower.15 To implemen curren EU requirements, he French Energy and Climate Ac of 2019 sets a arge of a leas 33 percen of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption by 2030.16 In 2022, his share was 20.7 percent;17 in Germany i was 20.8 percent. After he EU arge was increased from 32 to 42.5 or even 45 percent,18 France is also expected o adjus its argets for 2030 accordingly. However, its recently submit­ ted plan contains no adjustmen of its argets so far. Instead, i sets a arge for he share of carbon-free energy sources, which include nuclear power as well as renewable energy.19 Reducing fossil fuel consumption In contras o Germany, France has se explici",
    "argets for reducing he consumption of primary fossil fuels. By 2030, i aims o have reduced its consumption by 40 percen over 2012 levels. This will require a considerable reduction in cur­ ren consumption rends.20 15 Umweltbundesamt, “Erneuerbare Energien in Zahlen,” (2023) (in German; available online). 16 Légifrance, Article L100-4 of he French Energy Code (available online). 17 The data for 2022 are preliminary.

This share has risen stead­ ily since 2015, from jus under 19 percen in 2015 o 28 per­ cen in 2022.26 However, he rend for he years from 2020 to 2022 should be interpreted with caution, as 2022 was in many respects an exceptional year for he French electricity system because generation from nuclear and hydroelectric power plants was historically low. In Germany, he argets for renewable energy are significantly higher. The aim is o achieve a share of a leas 80 percen of renewable energy in gross electricity consumption by 2030. Growth in photovoltaics For he photovoltaics sector, France’s multi-annual energy program (PPE) sets a arge of 20.1 gigawa s (GW) of installed capacity for 2023 and between 35.1 and 44 GW for 2028. By the end of September 2023, here were 18.3 GW of installed capacity, and no new data has been available since. This means ha 1.8 GW would have o have been added between September and December 2023 for his arge o have been achieved, which is he equivalen of more han wha has been installed in he firs hree quarters of 2023. I can be assumed ha his arge will no be achieved. Nevertheless, expansion of he photovoltaics industry since he beginning of 2021 has accelerated significantly and he rend over he pas 12 months is significantly above ha of he pas five years (Figure 4). The firs draf of he hird multi-annual energy program contains even higher argets of 54 o 60 GW in 2030 and 75 o 100 GW in 2035. In comparison, Germany has an installed capacity of over 80 GW from photovoltaics. I plans o increase his figure to 215 GW by 2030 and o 309 GW by 2035.",
    "Relative o cur­ ren population, he argets for 2035 in France correspond o around 1.1 o 1.5 kilowa (kW) per capita. A around 3.7 kW per person, Germany’s arge for 2035 is around hree imes higher. Slow expansion of onshore wind power For onshore wind power plants, he curren plans sets capac­ ity argets of 24.1 GW for 2023 and 33.2 o 34.7 GW by 2028. A he end of September 2023, installed capacity amounted to 21.9 GW and was herefore 2.2 GW below he arge ha should have been achieved hree months later. As a result, the arge is likely o be missed. In contras o photovoltaics, growth in onshore wind energy has no accelerated recently, 25 RTE, “Annual Electricity Review 2022,” (2024) (available online); cf. also Umweltbundesamt, Entwicklung der spezifischen Treibhausgas-Emissionen des deutschen Strommix in den Jahren 1990–2022, (2023) (in German, available online). 26 Ministère de la Transition Écologique e de la Cohésion des Territoires, Service des données e études statistiques, “Chiffres des des énergies renouvelables – Edition 2023,” (2023) (available online). Targets in he power sector In 2023, nuclear power generated around 65 percen of France’s electricity, followed by hydropower with 12 per­ cen (Figure 3). Wind power and solar energy recently grew to en and four percen of power generation, respectively. The otal share of renewable energy in overall power gener­ ation was 18 percent. Coal- and gas-fired power plants con­ tinued on a downward rend and accounted for jus under seven percen of power generation in 2023 (compared o ten percen in 2007).21 In 2023, only jus over one percen of electricity generation in Germany came from nuclear power plants, while over half came from renewable energy sources. Coal- and gas-fired power plants ogether accounted for jus under 42 percent.22 Annual power generation in France (527 o 550 erawa hours (TWh) in he period from 2000 o 2021) is usually well above annual consumption (425 o 499 TWh),23 which makes i a ne exporter of electricity.24 The only exception was in 2022 when France became a ne importer due o a emporary out­ age of a large portion of its nuclear power plants. Due o its high share of nuclear power, France’s carbon intensity of he power mix is relatively small. Generated electricity emi ed less han 50 grams of CO2 per kilowa hour.

I is herefore essen­ tial o speed up he pace of expansion o achieve argets for 2028. This applies all he more if he increased argets from 33 o 35 GW of installed capacity by 2030 (and 40 o 45 GW by 2035) se ou in he lates French energy and climate strat­ egy (SFEC) are o be achieved. In comparison, Germany currently has an installed capac­ ity of around 61 GW from onshore wind power. This figure should rise o 115 GW by 2030 and o 157 GW by 2035. The French arge for 2035 corresponds o around 0.6 o 0.7 kW per capita; Germany’s arge is around 1.9 kW per capita. France’s foray into offshore wind power The expansion of offshore wind power in France began in the second quarter of 2022 with he commissioning of its firs offshore wind farm off he coas of Saint-Nazaire with a capacity of 480 MW. Two further farms were connected o the grid by he end of 2023, increasing installed capacity o around 1.5 GW. However, his developmen will no be suffi­ cien o achieve he arge of 2.4 GW of installed capacity se for 2023. Hence, France firs needs o make up a shortfall of around one GW; i mus hen install a further 2.8 GW within five years in order o achieve he lower arge of 5.2 GW by 2028. To reach he upper arge of 6.2 GW, around hree times as much capacity as wha has been installed o date would need o be added by he end of 2028. The new arge recently proposed for 2030 of four GW is actually slightly below he lower arge of he curren multi-annual program plan; however, i is aiming o achieve much stronger growth up o 18 GW by 2035. In comparison, Germany currently has an installed capacity of a good eight GW from offshore wind power. The plan is to reach 30 GW by 2030 and 40 GW jus five years after hat. In erms of argets per capita, France’s new goal for 2035 is equivalen o 0.3 kW per capita, while in Germany his fig­ ure is nearly 0.5 kW. Changing course on nuclear power The 2015 legislation se a arge for reducing he nuclear power share in otal electricity generation for he firs ime. I was o be gradually reduced from 76 percen in 2015 o 50 per­ cen by 2025. This arge was hen amended by he Energy and Climate Ac of 2019, which pushed he arge year back to 2035. In he end, his arge was abandoned completely.27 The upper limi of 63.2 GW for otal nuclear power gener­ ation capacity was also abandoned.

Transpor sector: differen rends in biofuels and electromobility Due o he ranspor sector’s high share in otal GHG emis­ sions, measures in his area are key o France’s climate pol­ icy. Passenger vehicles, which accoun for more han half of greenhouse gas emissions in his sector, are particularly important.29 In France here are around 39 million passenger vehicles30 compared o around 49 million in Germany. The per capita figure is almos he same for both countries, with around 590 cars for France and 580 cars for Germany per 1,000 inhabitants. Stagnation in biofuels France aims o achieve a 15-percen share of renewable energy in ranspor fuel consumption by no later han 2030. In 2022, i achieved a share of nearly nine percent.31 Biodiesel made up around 72 percen of ha figure followed by bioeth­ anol with 27 percent.32 Compared along a linear arge path between 2015 and 2030, he share recently achieved was 2.5 percentage points oo low.33 In addition, he rend in recen years has been stagnan or even downward. The use of biofuels has also been stagnating for years in Germany. Instead, both countries intend o rely heavily on electromo­ bility in he future. Electromobility: modes argets achieved The multi-annual energy program also includes specific targets for he number of all-electric vehicles and plug-in hybrid passenger cars as well as for he number of publicly accessible charging points between 2023 and 2028. The plan is o have 660,000 all-electric vehicles and 500,000 plug-in hybrid passenger cars by he end of 2030;34 hese numbers are supposed o grow o hree million vehicles and 1.8 mil­ lion passenger vehicles, respectively, by 2028.

One of hese measures was he “ecological bonus” for purchasing a new or used electric vehicle (up o 7,000 euros) and a “conversion bonus” for purchasing a low emission vehicle if a less environmentally friendly vehicle is aken ou of service (up o 6,000 euros).37 In addition, a ax mus be paid when a vehicle is firs registered if he vehicle is classi­ fied as environmentally harmful (known as he “ ecological penalty”).38 The level of he ax depends on how environ­ mentally harmful he purchased vehicle is. Since January 2024, here has also been a social leasing offer for house­ holds under a certain income hreshold and who have a suf­ ficiently long commute. I allows hem o lease an electric vehicle for 100 euros per month.39 Germany has a arge of 15 million all-electric ba ery pow­ ered passenger vehicles by 2030. Currently, here are only 1.4 million such vehicles on he road in Germany. Using a logistic progression path, indicative intermediary argets for 2023 and 2028 are around 1.8 million and hen 10.1 mil­ lion electric cars, respectively. These argets are significantly higher han hose in France, bu he actual growth in num­ bers is currently lagging behind he arge path.40 In erms of curren passenger vehicle numbers, he French arge for 2028 corresponds o a share of jus under eigh percen for all-electric vehicles. In Germany, he derived arge for 2028 produces a corresponding share of jus under 21 per­ cent, and he 15 million electric cars envisaged by 2030 cor­ respond o a share of jus under 31 percent. The arge for publicly accessible charging points was se a 100,000 by 202341 and 400,000 by 2030 (including 50,000 fast-charging points).42 This arge for 2023 was already achieved in May of 2023.

According o he mos recently available data, i has nearly 100,000 charging points.44 Tha is fewer than in France, despite i having a larger number of electric cars on he road. Buildings: high energy consumption, bu comparatively low emissions Buildings in France are responsible for almos half of final energy consumption,45 almos wo hirds of which is from residential buildings. However, he buildings sector only accounted for around 18 percen of greenhouse gas emis­ sions in 2021 due o a high proportion of electric heating.46 In 2021, more han a hird of main residential buildings ha year used electricity as heir main source of energy for heat­ ing (including jus under eigh percen with hea pumps).47 In Germany, space heating accounts for a slightly smaller share of final energy consumption han in France, a jus under one hird.48 However, in 2022, hea pumps and stor­ age heaters accounted for a significantly lower share of all domestic heating systems in Germany a jus under six and two percen respectively.49 France’s strategy for reducing emissions in he buildings sector is based on further electrifying its heating systems and banning echnologies with high emissions. In addition, energy consumption is o be reduced hrough improved building insulation. Since January 2023, new rental contracts for apartments in existing buildings can only be concluded if hey mee a certain energy efficiency level.50 Furthermore, the installation of heating systems ha emi more han 300 grams of CO2 equivalen per kilowa hour has been prohib­ ited since July 1, 2022, which means a de facto ban on he installation of new oil-fired boilers.51 Besides, he installation of natural gas heating systems in new single-family homes has been prohibited since 2022. They will also be banned in new apartmen buildings from 2025. France was consider­ ing reducing he emissions ceiling from 300 o 150",
    "grams of CO2 equivalen per kilowa hour. This would have resulted 44 Bundesnetzagentur, “Elektromobilität: Öffentliche Ladeinfrastruktur,” (2023) (in German, available online). 45 Ministère de la Transition EÉologique e de la Cohésion des Territoires, Service des données e études statistiques, “Chiffres clés de l’énergie – Edition 2023,” (2023) (available online). 46 Centre interprofessionnel echnique d'études de la pollution atmosphérique (CITEPA), Rappor Secten (2023) (available online).

Germany’s coalition governmen (SPD/FDP/Greens) had originally se ou plans in its coalition agreemen hat, from 2025, i would only allow new heating systems ha are pow­ ered by a leas 65 percen renewable energy. This star date was o be brough forward by one year, bu after lengthy dis­ cussions relating o he Buildings Energy Act, i is now being postponed. Gas or oil heating systems may now continue o be installed in existing buildings until a heating plan is avail­ able in he respective municipality, which may ake until June 2028 depending on he municipality.53 Strong growth of renewable energy in he heating sector By 2030, France aims o achieve a 38 percen share of renew­ able energy in gross final energy consumption for heating and cooling. In 2022, ha share was 27.2 percent. The larg­ es contribution was made by heating with wood in house­ holds (40 percen of energy consumption for heating and cooling from renewable energy sources), followed by hea pumps (27 percent), and biomass excluding wood (23 per­ cent).54 The share achieved was herefore slightly below he figure expected from a linear arge path between 2015 and 2030.55 However, he recen rend has been dynamic with the share of renewable energy rising from 21.4 percen in 2018 o 27.2 percen in 2022. If France can keep his pace up until 2030, i will achieve its arge of 38 percen for ha year. The increase was largely due o he expansion of hea pump installation, which progressed much faster in France than in Germany. One reason for he lower uptake of hea pumps in Germany is likely its higher household electric­ ity prices. Furthermore,",
    "natural gas was long regarded as a “bridge fuel” in Germany, and he installation of new nat­ ural gas heating systems was even subsidized here until recently. In France, hea pumps have been subsidized for some ime now. The multi-annual energy program sets ou specific goals for annual hea generation from hea pumps. The arge for 2023 is jus under 40 TWh per year, of which 35 TWh is o be provided by air-source hea pumps and jus under five TWh by geothermal hea pumps.56 In 2022, otal hea generation from hea pumps amounted o 42.7 TWh (weather-adjusted to 47.6 TWh), which is well above he arget. The main rea­ son for his developmen was he recen significan increase 52 Gouvernemen français, Dossier de concertation – Accélérer la décarbonation du secteur du bâtimen (2023): 29 (available online). 53 For a more in-depth discussion on hea pumps and he Buildings Energy Act, cf. episodes 7 to 9 of he fossilfrei podcas (in German; available online). 54 Ministère de la Transition Écologique e de la Cohésion des Territoires, Service des données e études statistiques, “Les énergies renouvelables en France en 2022 – Suivi de la directive (UE) 2018/2001 relative à la promotion de l’utilisation des énergies renouvelables,” (2023) (available online). 55 The corresponding visualization can be found on he Open Energy Tracker (available online). 56 Article 4 of Decree No. 2020-456 dated April 21, 2020, on multi-annual energy planning ( available online). 40 DIW Weekly Repor 4+5/2024 FRENCH ENERGY TRANSITION appears o be meeting its argets, mainly due o he strong expansion of hea pumps. I has not, however, me its renewable energy argets and progress over he las five years, particularly in he ranspor sector, is no very encouraging. In general, France is behind on all its argets o expand photovoltaics and onshore and offshore wind power. I is instead relying on nuclear power. This is a political decision, which clearly underlines he “éco­ logie à la française” under Macron’s presidency.59,60 However, if its argets for renewable energy are o be achieved, i will need o expand its wind and solar power plants significantly. Although here are differences in he energy policy goals of France and Germany, here are also similarities. Greenhouse gas emissions are already significantly lower in France, bu Germany is aiming o go climate neutral five years before France. In erms of mobility and space heating, both coun­ tries are focusing on electrification. While Germany’s argets for electromobility are more ambitious, he number of elec­ tric cars and charging infrastructure clearly needs o grow faster in both countries. France is currently making faster progress han Germany on expanding hea pumps. The differences are greates in he electricity sector: While France is prioritizing nuclear power,61 Germany is relying heavily on renewable energy. France is also aiming o use more wind power and solar energy over he long erm, bu a a considerably lower level. I would make sense for France o expand renewable energy faster. This would no only",
    "allow i o achieve its argets for renewable energy, which i has no met, bu i would also help the country mee its climate goals and safeguard agains he risks of using nuclear power. If here are further problems with existing power plants in he future or delays in con­ structing new reactors, an additional, increased expansion of renewable energy would be helpful. The risk ha France would generate “too much” emission-free power as a result, appears o be low considering he strong growth in demand for renewable electricity expected in Europe. 59 Which can be ranslated in English as a kind of “made in France ecology.” 60 Cf.

If he rend from he pas five years continues, he 2028 arge (between 44 and 52 TWh) will be achieved early (Figure 5). In Germany, he annual increase in hea pumps is considerably lower. In 2022, only 236,000 hea pumps were installed;57 half a million new hea pumps are expected o be installed each year from 2024. Conclusion: Positive and negative developments in he French energy ransition France’s energy and climate policy comprises a large num­ ber of short-, medium-, and long-term argets ha are revised in five-year, structured planning processes. However, he French governmen is now behind schedule: France’s new five-year law on energy and climate strategy should have been adopted a lates on July 1, 2023. An initial draf bill was submi ed a he end of 2023 bu was immediately crit­ icized for its lack of specific argets for renewable energy.58 France currently appears o be largely on rack o reduce its gross greenhouse gas emissions, although his is certainly also due o he unique effects of he COVID-19 pandemic and he energy price crisis.
