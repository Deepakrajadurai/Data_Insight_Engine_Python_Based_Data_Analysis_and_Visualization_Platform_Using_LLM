DIW Weekly Report 1+2 2024 AT A GLANCE Decline in nominal construction volume expected for he firs ime since he financial crisis; residential construction situation worsening By Martin Gornig and Laura Pagenhardt • Falling construction prices will cause construction volume o decline by 3.5 percen in nominal terms and by 1.5 percen in real erms in 2024 • Residential construction is declining markedly, more so in new construction han in renovation • Goal of constructing 400,000 residences per year becoming more ou of reach • Only civil engineering is cushioning he downturn and will increase again in 2025 • The situation is expected o stabilize in 2025 MEDIA Audio Interview with Laura Pagenhard (in German) www.diw.de/mediathek FROM THE AUTHORS “To provide he construction industry with some momentum again, i is very importan for policy makers o deal with he uncertainty regarding subsidy programs as soon as possible. This includes he subsidy program for energy-efficien building renovation, bu also new residential construction.” — Laura Pagenhard — 2024 even weaker han 2023: Worsening crisis in residential construction, while civil engineering cushions he downturn Real change in construction volume in percen compared o previous year 4 DIW Weekly Repor 1+2/2024 DOI: h ps://doi.org/10.18723/diw_dwr:2024-1-1 CONSTRUCTION VOLUME CALCULATION Decline in nominal construction volume expected for he firs ime since he financial crisis; residential construction situation worsening By Martin Gornig and Laura Pagenhardt ABSTRACT High construction prices and worsened financing conditions are weighing on he construction industry, especially build­ ing construction. Despite a nominal increase of six percen in construction",
    "expenses in 2023, i decreased by jus over one percen in inflation-adjusted erms. In 2024, he nominal construction volume is likely o contrac by around 3.5 per­ cent, declining for he firs ime since he financial crisis due o falling construction prices. Residential construction in particu­ lar experienced a sharp decline in 2023 and will continue on this downward rend more strongly in 2024. Renovation and modernization activity is less affected han new construction. The situation will stabilize by 2025. The prospec of con­ structing 400,000 new residences annually is hus becoming increasingly ou of reach. Only civil engineering is stabilizing the construction industry overall; i is likely o expand in both 2024 and 2025. The differen growth prospects of he sectors require restructuring in he construction industry. In particu­ lar, capacities freed up in new residential construction should be utilized in he energy-efficien renovation of private and public buildings. Policy makers should actively suppor his restructuring. In addition, hey should provide clarity abou he subsidy programs for energy-efficien building renovation and residential uni construction. A he same ime, i is importan to maintain focus on he new housing construction arget. The construction industry in Germany continues o strug­ gle. The crisis began in 2021 with material and supply bot­ tlenecks and continued in 2022 and 2023 with he energy crisis and loss of household purchasing power due o con­ sumer price inflation. This was compounded by rapidly ris­ ing interes rates, which made i considerably more diffi­ cul o finance construction projects, particularly for private households, bu also for companies. In particular, incoming orders and building permits for new residential construc­ tion plummeted las year. Due o he very dynamic devel­ opmen of construction prices, he construction volume in nominal erms increased over he years, bu price-adjusted declines have already been recorded in almos all construc­ tion sectors since 2021. Nominal construction volume is expected o contrac in 2024. Due o declining capacity utilization and falling material prices, prices are likely o fall as well and a urnaround in interes rates is expected in summer 2024. However, as prices and interes rates are likely o remain high overall and many subsidy programs are in limbo, he building construction volume in particular is likely o suffer and in some cases decline considerably. Developmen is likely o improve in 2025, bu strong growth is no expected. These are he results of DIW Berlin’s calculations of he con­ struction volume,1 which includes construction investments as well as repairs ha do no increase value. Furthermore, in addition o construction in he narrower sense, he calcula­ tions encompass related sectors, such as steel and ligh metal construction, he manufacture of prefabricated buildings, building fi ings, planning, and other services. As a supple­ men o he investmen calculation of he Statistical Offices, DIW Berlin’s annual construction volume differentiates 1 The construction volume calculation is financed with funds from he Zukunf Bau research in­ itiative of he Federal Ministry for Housing, Urban Developmen and Building (Bundesministerium",
    "für Wohnen, Stadtentwicklung und Bauwesen, BMWSB). Cf. he mos recen construction volume calculation: Martin Gornig and Laura Pagenhardt, \"Construction Boom Coming o an End; Change in Policy Strategy Needed,\" DIW Weekly Report, no. 1+2 (2023) (available online; accessed on December 18, 2023.

DIW Berlin no only calculates and documents he construc­ tion volume of pas years; i also forecasts corresponding val­ ues for he curren (2024) and upcoming years (2025). This forecas (Box) is integrated into DIW Berlin’s Economic Outlook, particularly with regard o investmen activity. In addition o he presen estimates regarding he developmen of construction investment, he construction volume calcu­ lation includes forecasts on he growth of new and existing housing volumes in he building construction, residential, and non-residential sectors.3 Moreover, hese figures are used o derive he developmen rends of he core construc­ tion industry and he renovation sector. Residential construction situation worsening The pas hree years have been difficul for he residential construction sector. The enormous price increases—which began in 2021 due o supply bo lenecks and material short­ ages before hen being exacerbated by he energy crisis in 2022—were compounded by he ECB’s key interes rate hikes, which had an impac on mortgage rates within a very shor period of ime: Between he end of 2021 and autumn 2023, interes rates rose from 1.3 o over four percent. In 2024, hey are now as high as hey were las in 2011 (Figure 1). Financing conditions are currently almos impossible o meet, especially for private households, resulting in projects being reduced, canceled, or no initiated a all. This is also reflected in new orders, which have been rending downward since early 2022 and have only recently stabilized (Figure 2). 3 Cf.

Box Method for forecasting construction volume Indicator-based statistical models are used o forecas he construction volume. The forecasting variable, for example residential construction volume, is regressed on an autore­ gressive erm and on concurren as well as lagged values of the respective indicator, for example new orders. The con­ struction volumes of new and existing buildings are estimated separately. The forecas equation is as follows: y stands for he value o be forecast, x for he indicator, and ε for he statistical error erm. α, βi, and γj are he estimated parameters. The numbers of lags n and m (years) are deter­ mined based on",
    "he autocorrelation or cross-correlation func­ tion. The approach of estimating a large number of individual models and using average values for he forecas has proved effective. For an individual series, up o 1,500 single models are estimated. Construction permits, new orders and he order backlog, production, interest, loan volumes, employmen and income rends, and surveys of construction companies and freelance architects have proven o be suitable indicators.1 Using his approach, a forecas with a prediction capability of up o wo years can be made for all aggregates. I should be noted, however, ha he number of poin estimates used for averaging decreases significantly as he forecas range increases due o he differen prediction capabilities of he individual indicators. To provide he forecas with additional stability, expectations for employmen and GDP for 2023 o 2025 are herefore also included in he models as concurren indicators. Expected civil engineering volume is equal o he difference between otal volume and construction volume. The construction volume forecas for he previous year (2023) is also calculated using his method (nowcast). The indicators are updated using statistical methods o obtain values for 2023. All model results are rationalized using he construction investmen forecast. Assumptions abou he developmen of construction prices are based on he DIW Berlin economic forecas for winter 2023 and he authors’ calculations. Price forecasts are adjusted for each sectors. 1 Michelsen and Gornig, “Prognose der Bestandsmaßnahmen und Neubauleistungen im Wohnungsbau und im Nichtwohnungsbau.” 6 DIW Weekly Repor 1+2/2024 CONSTRUCTION VOLUME CALCULATION According o he ifo Institute, nearly half of residential con­ struction companies have complained abou a lack of orders, while a fifth of hem are dealing with order cancelations.4 For example, he number of existing orders have shrunk consid­ erably since he peak in spring 2022 (Figure 3). According to an autumn 2023 survey conducted by he Zentralverband des Deutschen Baugewerbes (ZDB), 70 percen of construction companies expec he business situation o worsen.5 The outlook for 2024 is no much be er.

The uncertainty abou he future develop­ men of income and he overall economic outpu is likely o further dampen housing investments. The continuing high demand for (affordable) living space, especially in urban centers, does li le o change his. For example, accord­ ing o studies from he Hans Böckler Foundation and its Macroeconomic Policy Institute (IMK), potentially millions of additional units of social housing are still needed in large German cities.6 Following hree years of enormous increases, construction prices are expected o decline in 2024:",

Accordingly, he noticeable wage increases ha are expected following he collective wage negotiations are likely to come a he expense of corporate profits. Meanwhile, a urnaround in interes rates is expected in early summer 2024, when marke participants foresee he firs ECB interes rate cuts.7 Financing conditions are here­ fore likely o ease somewha his year. The declines in prices, 7 Timm Bönke e al., “DIW Berlin Economic Forecast: Forecas ranges from cloudy o bright,” DIW Weekly Report, no. 50+51+52 (2023): 305–313 (available online). however, will likely be unable o completely compensate for the continued high interes rate. Overall, he nominal residential construction volume in 2023 likely increased by 5.5 percen (Table 1). Construction price inflation is likely o have completely swallowed up this increase, resulting in a real decline of 2.3 percent. In 2024, he residential construction volume is expected o sig­ nificantly decrease despite falling prices in both nominal (minus 5.4 percent) and real (minus 3.4 percent) erms. A further nominal decline of 0.4 percen is expected for 2025 (Figure 5). As prices are expected o sink further, here is real growth of 0.4 percent. Residential uni construction sector in a slump The problems in residential construction are particularly affecting new construction. There, difficul financing condi­ tions are likely playing he decisive role, making i impossi­ ble for a large share of households o star new construction plans. Building permits have plummeted since he begin­ ning of 2022: In autumn 2023, hey were almos 40 percen below he peak values in 2021 and 2022 (Figure 6). In addi­ tion, a large number of approved projects have no started because financing is no longer viable in many places. This is likely o have a significan impac in new construction activ­ ity in he coming years if existing orders are increasingly pro­ cessed and fewer and fewer new projects are initiated. For example, he Verband der Wohnungswirtschaf Deutschland (GdW) is already reporting ha many housing companies Figure 3 Stock of orders in he main construction industry Index 2015 = 100, curren prices, rend component Source: Deutsche Bundesbank. © DIW Berlin 2024 The stock of orders in residential construction is rending upward.

Nevertheless, nominal residential construction is expected to decline by 8.4 percen in 2024 and o no recover in 2025 (minus",

Work on existing buildings continues o have a stabilizing effect The robus developmen in renovation measures is likely o have supported housing construction activity in 2023. While some expansion and renovation projects have likely been cu back or even canceled completely due o higher costs— such projects can be adjusted more quickly and easily han new construction projects—a he same ime he decline in new construction is likely o make more builders available for renovation and modernization projects, which in urn will make hese projects more feasible. A he same ime, renovation and modernization is likely to be significantly less affected by rising financing costs: Compared o new residential construction, modernization and maintenance measures are much smaller in scale, mean­ ing ha households often have sufficien capital o finance the costs.10 Only he higher incentive for households o save capital mus be considered here. However, saving is only worthwhile o a limited extent: The credi interes rates for longer-term investments are currently only half as high as the mortgage rate for en-year loans. The fac ha households are increasingly switching o reno­ vation and modernization measures is also reflected in he costs for approved construction projects: A he star of 2022, the costs for new construction and for work on existing build­ ings were still a similar levels. While permi figures and new construction costs have almos halved, he figures for renovation have remained a near constan levels (Figure 7). Measures o increase energy efficiency are likely o con­ tinue o play a central role: Energy prices, despite he declines in recen years, remain high and are expected o rise again somewha as a resul of he Federal Governmen initiating an additional increase in he carbon price in he Nachtragshaushaltsgesetz 2021 in reaction o he recen Federal Constitutional Cour ruling.11 This increases he incentives to inves in energy-related renovations. 10 Christian Blanke and Katrin Klarhöfer, “Bestandsinvestitionen 2020: Struktur der Investitions­ tätigkei in den Wohnungs­ und Nichtwohnungsbeständen,” BBSR Online Publikation, no. 39 (2022) (in German; available online). 11 In November 2023, he Federal Constitutional Cour ruled agains he German government, prohibiting he reallocation of 60 billion euros borrowed under emergency legislation during he COVID­19 pandemic owards he Climate and Transformation Fund.

    "funding for energy-efficien refurbishmen measures is still unclear. For example, around 19 billion euros were planned for funding energy-efficien renovations in he building sector in he Klima- und Transformationsfonds (Climate and Transformation Fund, KTF) in 2024. While he Federal Governmen promised his funding immediately after he Federal Constitutional Court’s ruling, he applica­ tion process a KfW is still on hold. Thus, he developmen of renovation work may also be slowed down or a leas delayed. Overall, renovation works are expected o decline by 4.1 per­ cen his year, considerably less han new construction work. For 2025, a further sligh decline of 0.3 percen is expected. Price-adjusted, his results in minus 2.2 percen in 2024 and in 0.5 percen in 2025. More robus developmen in non-residential construction han in residential construction Non-residential construction was more stable han residen­ tial construction in 2023. The worsened financing conditions are likely o have affected companies less han households. While new orders for both public and commercial building construction declined somewha in 2023, hey are currently increasing again due o multiple major projects (Figure 2). Thus, existing orders remain a a record level (Figure 3). Nevertheless, weak overall economic developmen and high interes rates are dampening he outlook for commercial con­ struction. The global economy has developed less dynam­ ically recently; in 2023, German exports declined notice­ ably. The developmen of he German economy over he course of he year remains uncertain, partly due o he Federal Constitutional Cour ruling and despite he planned miti­ gating measures, dampening both exports and investments in 2024.12 This is likely o keep companies from investing in capacity expansion, for example by constructing new work­ shops or warehouses. In 2023, nominal non-residential construction increased by 5.1 percent. In price-adjusted erms, however, i declined by 0.9 percent. This developmen is expected o reverse in 2024: A nominal minus hree percen is expected, which, due o falling prices, ends up as a real minus of nearly one percent. In 2025, non-residential construction volume is expected to expand by 1.2 percen nominally and by 2.5 percen in price-adjusted erms (Table 2). Public construction projects supporting new construction of non-residential buildings The demand for new commercial buildings has slowed due to weak economic development, which makes investments in new corporate buildings seem imprudent. Moreover, he possibility o work from home, which has become more prev­ alen since he coronavirus pandemic, is dampening he need 12 Bönke e al., “DIW Berlin Economic Forecast.” for office buildings. In 2022 (the mos recen available sta­ tistics), nearly a quarter of all employees partially worked a home. This share is likely o no have declined significantly in 2023. Thus, he number of building permits for office and administrative buildings has also continually declined since 2020 (Figure 6). No stimuli are expected here. Large projects are now stabilizing he order situation in he public construction sector; existing orders have increased considerably (Figure 3). Funds ha have been created in recen years should now gradually be converted into projec",
    "budgets. Falling construction prices facilitate his develop­ ment. Thus, positive stimuli from public construction are expected in both 2024 and 2025. Overall, new construction activity in non-residential build­ ings is likely o decrease by 4.2 percen nominally in 2024 before expanding by 1.4 percen in 2025. Price-adjusted, Figure 7 Number of permits granted for new construction projects Index, Monthly average in 2021 = 100 Source: Federal Statistical Office. © DIW Berlin 2024 The number of construction permits for existing buildings is markedly higher han he figure for new buildings. 12 DIW Weekly Repor 1+2/2024 CONSTRUCTION VOLUME CALCULATION also still a large investmen gap, particularly in he pub­ lic sector: Planned and realized investments have gradually increased in nominal erms in recen years, with an empha­ sis on investments in school buildings and other childcare facilities. Overall, however, he projects realized remained well below he planned budget.13 Here, here is still much potential o expand construction work. Work on existing non-residential buildings is likely o decline by wo percen nominally in 2024 before increasing by a good one percen in 2025. Due o he falling prices, he price-ad­ justed growth is 0.1 percen for 2024 and 2.4 percen for 2025. Only civil engineering o increase in 2024 The activity in he civil engineering sector stabilized he construction volume in 2023. While construction outpu in building construction was on he decline, i continued on an upward rend in civil engineering (Figure 8). Capacity uti­ lization in civil engineering also declined less significantly than in building construction (Figure 4). Because of he considerable need for infrastructure expan­ sion, civil engineering is likely o expand further in 2024 and 2025. Strong stimuli are expected, primarily from he com­ mercial investor side. New orders are already indicating sig­ nifican growth (Figure 2): In commercial civil engineering, new orders were nearly 30 percen higher in nominal erms in autumn 2023 compared o 2022. Large orders from he Deutsche Bahn are likely o be he decisive factor here, with massive investments being made in he rail network. These investments will likely continue in 2024 and 2025, partly because he KTF funds earmarked for railway infrastructure appear o be secured. In addition, here are investments in the mobility and energy ransitions. New orders in road con­ struction, which is par of he public sector, are also rend­ ing upward, although with less momentum. A similar pic­ ture emerges for he existing orders (Figure 3). Following nominal growth of 9.5 percen in 2023 (real: 2.6 percent) in civil engineering, i is expected o increase by only 1.8 (real: 3.6) percen his year and o expand again by 2.3 percen (real: 3.3 percent) in 2025 (Table 3). Civil engineering canno compensate decline in building construction Real construction volume is expected o decline for he hird year in a row in 2024. Following declines of 2.2 percen in 2022 and of a li le over one percen in 2023, construction volume is likely o decline by 1.5 percen in price adjusted",
    "terms in 2024. Real growth in he otal construction volume is no expected until 2025 (Table 4). However, he construction industry is divided. The some­ times drastic declines in new residential construction are 13 Christian Raffer and Henrik Scheller, KfW – Kommunalpanel 2023 (2023) (in German; available online). this results in a 2.1-percen decline in 2024 and 2.7 percen growth in 2025. Energy-related renovation increases construction on existing buildings Construction on existing non-residential buildings has become less importan over recen years: Between 2016 and 2022, its share of otal construction volume declined con­ tinually (Table 2), primarily because he new construction volume increased substantially. In 2023, his developmen is likely o have reversed: Higher energy prices increase he incentive o perform energy-related renovations. This is likely to have played a decisive role in he strong increase in ren­ ovation and modernization. The incentives will remain in 2024 and are likely o con­ tinue o suppor renovation and modernization. There is Figure 8 Production in he construction industry Index 2015 = 100, constan prices, rend component Source: Federal Statistical Office. © DIW Berlin 2024 Civil engineering production continued o rend upward in 2023 in contras with building construction. 13 DIW Weekly Repor 1+2/2024 CONSTRUCTION VOLUME CALCULATION partly counterbalanced by quite substantial increases in civil engineering. Even some structural engineering sectors, such as roofing and insulation, have a positive outlook for 2024 as a resul of increased energy-related renovation. Overall, real construction volume in he main construction industry is likely o decline only slightly in 2023 and 2024. A significan increase of nearly wo percen is expected for 2025. The renovation sector will continue o be heavily impacted by he declines in residential construction. In 2024, he real construction volume in construction installation and other expansion work will likely be 2.5 percen below he 2023 level again. Weak residential uni construction in particular is having a negative impac on other construction-related ser­ vices such as architecture firms. Real construction volume in he renovation sector will probably contrac for he fourth year in a row in 2024. As in he other sectors of he indus­ try, however, he economic outlook should brighten in 2025. Conclusion: Necessary shifts in capacity require binding political guidelines Construction services will decline again in 2024. Noticeable real growth in construction volume is no expected until Table 4 Key figures for he developmen of construction volume in Germany 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 In billion euros a he respective year’s prices Change from he previous year in percent Total construction volume 395.7 420.4 437.8 472.2 532.9 565.3 545.8 548.7 6.3 4.1 7.8 12.9 6.1 −3.5 0.5 Residential construction 224.8 240.9 252.7 274.7 307.1 323.8 306.4 305.3 7.2 4.9 8.7 11.8 5.5 −5.4 −0.4 Commercial construction 116.3 122.0 124.8 135.1 154.4 162.5 159.2 161.6 4.9 2.3 8.2 14.3 5.2 −2.0 1.5 Public construction 54.6 57.5 60.3 62.4 71.5 79.0 80.1 81.8 5.4 4.9 3.5 14.5 10.6 1.4 2.1 Index 2015=",

Nevertheless, many construction companies are fac­ ing major challenges. The differing outlooks for various sec­ tors in he industry require major restructuring in its capac­ ity profile. In particular, i will be importan o utilize he freed-up capacities in he energy-related renovation of pri­ vate",
    "and public buildings. In some cases, growth opportu­ nities in civil engineering can only be realized by using cor­ responding capacities from building construction. Policy makers should actively suppor restructuring in he construction industry. For example, inter-company raining and retraining capacities could be expanded and funded. In many cases, i will be crucial for he success of internal restructuring for workers o receive wage replacemen ben­ efits from he short-time work allowance during his phase. The continuing decline in new residential construction con­ tinues o rigger major political pressure for action. The number of completed residential units will no increase in ligh of shrinking investments in new construction over he nex years. The arge of 400,000 new dwellings per year is thus becoming less and less likely o be achieved. In reac­ tion o he low completion figures, among other hings, he Federal Governmen passed a package of measures ha should incentivize he construction of affordable and cli­ mate-friendly dwellings and stabilize he construction and real estate industries.14 14 Cf. he BMWSB website. However, initial assessments, particularly of ax incentives from degressive depreciation, indicate ha a considerable increase in he number of newly buil residences is unlikely in he shor o medium erm.15 The focus, however, should be less on he otal number of newly constructed buildings. Instead, as he greates imbalance between high housing demand and low housing supply exists in metropolitan areas, creating housing in he lower price segmen should be pri­ oritized. Densification, which has been discussed for years, can relieve he shortage in metropolitan areas specifically. In terms of cost, densification is more cos effective han cre­ ating residences on newly developed and expensive land. Furthermore, here are now cost-effective methods of add­ ing stories o existing buildings. There is currently a grea deal of uncertainty abou how the Federal Constitutional Cour ruling will affec funding of construction activity and he longer-term funding of he transition o climate neutrality. While clear agreements with federal companies are emerging in civil engineering, here is particular uncertainty as o how energy-efficien build­ ing refurbishmen and new residential construction will be funded. Policy makers mus quickly implemen binding reg­ ulations here, especially with regard o he KfW, so ha its funding can continue. 15 Claus Michelsen, Simon Junker, and Ferdinand Fichtner, “Simulation des Wachstums­ chancengesetzes: Richtung stimmt, Effekte zu gering,” Economic Policy Brief, no. 9 (Verband Forschender Arzneimi elhersteller e.
