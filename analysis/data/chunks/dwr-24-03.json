Thus, growth has slightly picked up again. In some of he groups of companies analyzed, he figure was even higher. Around 23 percen of executive board members a he DAX 40 companies, for example, are women. The larges banks and insurance companies, which in he pas years have lagged considerably behind other private sector companies and companies with government-owned shares, managed o catch up a bit. In many places, his growth is due o he fac ha companies have appointed a woman o heir executive board for he firs time. Beyond hat, here is currently no much progress. In addition, he number of women holding he position of CEO has decreased in many groups of companies. More commit­ men is needed from companies, both internally (e.g., from the supervisory board) and externally (e.g., from investors) o achieve gender parity in senior leadership positions. Since 2006, DIW Berlin’s Women Executives Barometer has been documenting he share of women1 on managemen boards and among managing directors (hereafter referred to as “executive boards”) as well as on supervisory, admin­ istrative, and advisory boards as well as boards of rustees (hereafter “supervisory boards”) of he larges companies in Germany.2 I is also documented o wha exten women hold executive board chair and executive board spokesper­ son positions (hereafter “CEO”) as well as supervisory board chair positions. These shares of women are reported here for he 200 larges companies in Germany (measured by revenue),3 all DAX companies,4 all companies with govern­ ment-owned shares,5 he 100 larges banks6 (measured by balance shee otal), and he 60 larges insurance companies7 (measured by revenue from contributions). Furthermore, the shares of women on executive boards and supervisory boards are reported separately for he companies subjec o the gender quota on supervisory boards and for he compa­ nies subjec o he 2021 inclusion requirement8 for execu­ 1 This Weekly Repor uses a binary understanding of gender. The gender of he persons analyzed was determined using heir firs name, pronouns, and picture. This year, here were no cases of a person who could be identified as non-binary. However, he authors of his repor are aware ha no every non-binary person makes heir gender identity publicly known. 2 Mos recently in 2023, cf. Anja Kirsch, Virginia Sondergeld, and Katharina Wrohlich, “Number of women on boards of large companies keeps growing; momentum from inclusion requirement, however, is waning,” DIW Weekly Report, no. 3+4 (2023): 20–31 (available online.

This applies o all other online sources in his repor unless stated otherwise). 3 The publication “Die 100 größten Unternehmen” from he Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (July 4, 2023) was used o selec he 100 and 200 highest-performing companies. Unlike its itle suggests, his publication actually contains he 200 larges companies in Germany. 4 The lis of listed companies in he individual DAX groups was aken from he website www.boerse.de (in German; available online. Accessed November 24, 2023). 5 The lis of all companies with government-owned shares was aken from he Federal Gov­ ernment’s Beteiligungsberich des Bundes 2022, which was published on February 28, 2023 (in German; available online). 6 The 100 larges banks (measured by balance shee otal) were selected according o Anja U. Kraus and Harald Kuck, “Die 100 größten deutschen Kreditinstitute,” Die Bank, Zeitschrif für Bankpolitik und Praxis 7 (2023): 14–25 (in German). 7 The 60 larges insurance companies (measured by revenue from contributions) were selected based on an analysis by he Kölner Institu für Versicherungsinformation und Wirtschaftsdienste (KIVI). Additionally, he larges reinsurance companies according o he 2021 reinsurance statistics (from December 31, 2021) published by he Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (Bundesan­ stal für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, BAFIN) in June 2023, were integrated into he group of he 60 larges insurance companies. 8 The lis of companies ha were subjec o he gender quota on supervisory boards in fall 2023 was kindly provided o us by FidAR e.V. 19 DIW Weekly Repor 3/2024 WOMEN EXECUTIVES BAROMETER: SHARE OF WOMEN tive boards. Altogether, he DIW Berlin Women Executives Barometer includes information on over 500 companies in Germany. The figures published here were researched from November 15 o November 27, 2023.9 The data are drawn from online company profiles, 2022 annual reports, finan­ cial statements, and he German Federal Government’s 2022 Beteiligungsbericht. I also includes information from German Federal Gaze e publications as well as specifc data requests made o he companies by DIW Berlin. Top 200 companies Share of women on executive boards continues o rise, bu number of women CEOs is declining In he fourth quarter of 2023, he share of women on he executive boards of he 200 larges companies (excluding he financial sector) was nearly 18 percen (Table 1 and Figure 1), an increase of almos wo percentage points compared o 9 The authors would like o hank Lana Lemke and Alina Meiner for heir excellen research support. 2022. Thus, following rather restrained growth in 2022, he share of women has begun o increase again. Since 2018, the share of women on he executive boards of he 200 larg­ es companies has almos doubled. The developmen among he op 100 companies was similar: There, he share of women on executive boards also increased by nearly wo percentage points and, as of late fall 2023, was over 19 percent. This share has also almos doubled since 2018. The increase in he share of women on executive boards, how­ ever, contrasts with a decline in he share",
    "of women CEOs: In both he op 200 and he op 100 companies, he number of women CEOs fell by one person in each case. Only nine (five percent) of he 200 larges companies had a woman CEO as of fall 2023, while only four (a li le over four percent) of the 100 larges had a woman CEO.10 10 Top 100: Aline Seifer (Alliance Healthcare Deutschland AG), Anna Maria Braun (B.

On average, women have made up almos one third of supervisory board members for several years now. The number of women leading a supervisory board among the 200 larges companies grew from 11 in 2022 o 13, a good eigh percent, in late fall 2023.11 In he fourth quarter of 2023, the 100 larges companies had seven women (eigh percent) supervisory board chairs. 11 Top 200: Anna Borg (Va enfall Deutschland), Anja Ritschel (Enercity AG), Be ina Würth (Würth-Gruppe), Cathrina Claas-Mühlhäuser (Claas KGaA mbH), Catherine Vandenborre (50Hertz Transmission GmbH), Clara C.

Publicly listed companies DAX 40 companies have he larges share of women on executive boards, bu MDAX and TecDAX companies are catching up In late fall 2023, he average share of women on he executive boards of he 160 publicly listed companies analyzed here (DAX 40, MDAX, SDAX, and TecDAX) was a good 18 per­ cent, hus nearly hree percentage points higher han in 2022. This share is very similar o he shares of women on the executive boards of he 200 and 100 larges companies. However, his average conceals major differences between the individual DAX groups. The larges publicly listed compa­ nies, he DAX 40, have had a larger share of women on heir executive boards han he SDAX, MDAX, and TecDAX com­ panies for more han en years (Table 2 and Table 3). There was a particularly strong increase in he share of women a the executive level in he DAX 40 group between 2020 and 2022 from almos 15 percen o nearly 22 percent. Recently, this momentum has slowed a bit; in he fourth quarter of 2023, he share of women on he executive boards of he DAX 40 companies was 23 percent, only a good one percent­ age poin higher han in",
    "2022. This means ha in late fall 2023, 59 of a otal of 256 executive board members across he 40 larges publicly listed companies were women. Figure 1 Shares of women and men in selected groups of companies In percent Source: Authors’ surveys and calculations. © DIW Berlin 2024 The executive boards of companies with government-owned shares experienced he mos growth recently. 21 DIW Weekly Repor 3/2024 WOMEN EXECUTIVES BAROMETER: SHARE OF WOMEN The MDAX companies, in contrast, experienced consider­ ably more growth: Here, he share of women on executive boards increased by nearly six percentage points and was nearly 18 percen mos recently. The TecDAX companies have developed similarly (Table 3): The share of women on executive boards experienced a comparatively strong increase of nearly five percentage points o around 21 percent. The share of women on he executive boards of SDAX companies grew much less: A a good 14 percent, he SDAX companies have he lowes share of women executive board members of all DAX groups. Moreover, he increase was no especially large, a only around wo percentage points. In contas o he growth of women on executive boards, he growth of women CEOs was either negative or stagnated, as is he case a he 200 and 100 larges companies. While wo DAX 40 companies had women CEOs in 2022, as of late fall 2023, here was only one: Belén Garijo, he CEO of Merck. One TecDAX company had a woman CEO in 2022, bu as of late fall 2023, ha is no longer he case. There was no change in he MDAX and SDAX companies, where here were wo and five women CEOs, respectively, as of he fourth quarter of 2023, as was he case in 2022. Comparing he DAX groups, the SDAX companies were ahead a jus over seven percen women CEOs, which contrasts with heir comparatively low share of women among executive board members overall.12 Sligh increase in he share of women on supervisory boards of all DAX groups In late fall 2023, he average share of women on super visory boards a all 160 DAX companies was nearly 36 percent, around wo percentage points higher han in 2022. The DAX 40 and TecDAX companies both had he greates share of women on supervisory boards a a good 38 percen each.

    "private sector, supervisory board seats in these companies are often ied o a leading position in public administration or o political mandates. The share of women in senior public administration positions and political office affects he share of women on he supervisory boards of hese companies due o his fact. As in pas years, companies with government-owned shares had a considerably higher share of women on executive boards han private sector companies. In late fall 2023, over one hird (a good 34 percent) of all executive board members 14 Companies with government-owned shares are a very heterogeneous group containing very large companies such as Deutsche Telekom AG and Deutsche Bahn AG, bu also some very small cultural or scientifc companies, such as he Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für Sozial­ forschung gGmbH (WZB), he Futurium gGMbH, or he Bayreuther Festspiele GmbH. companies recently experienced he mos growth, with he share of women on supervisory boards increasing by over two percentage points, while growth in he other DAX groups was around one percentage poin each. The share of women supervisory board chairs did no increase, with he exception of he TecDAX companies. In contrast, he number of women supervisory board chairs a DAX 40 companies was halved, from four o wo. Thus, in he fourth quarter of 2023, only a good five percen of DAX 40 companies had a woman head­ ing he supervisory board. The number of women supervi­ sory board chairs a MDAX companies remained he same (two women – four percent). Meanwhile, here was a decline among he SDAX companies (from hree o wo women), and with hat, he share of women supervisory board chairs was only barely hree percen as of late fall 2023. Compared to 2022, here was an additional woman supervisory board chair in he TecDAX companies.

In addi­ tion, unlike a he large companies in he private sector, he number of women CEOs has also continued o increase, recently from nine o 13 women (26 percent).15 In contrast, he share of women on supervisory boards of companies with government-owned shares declined slightly and was recently a 39 percen (minus a good one percentage point). Meanwhile, he share of women supervisory board chairs has increased o over 36 percen (22 women).16 Banks and insurance companies: Executive boards catching up while supervisory boards stagnate The larges companies in he financial sector, he 100 larges banks and 60 larges insurance companies, have been lagging significantly behind other large private sector companies for the pas en years in erms of he share of women on boards. Recently, however, hese wo groups began o catch up a bit: In late fall 2023, he share of women on he executive boards of he 100 larges banks was nearly 17 percen (an increase of a good wo percentage points) and hus similar o he fig­ ure in he 200 larges private sector companies (excluding the financial sector) (Table 5). The share of women a he 60 larges insurance companies even increased by almos",
    "three percentage points o over 18 percent. There was also growth in he share of women CEOs in he financial sector: The share of women CEOs a banks increased by almos four percentage points o nearly 12 percen (11 women), while he share a insurance companies increased by around hree per­ centage points o a good eigh percen (five women). Thus, the figures for banks and insurance companies were signif­ icantly higher han he respective figures for he 200 or 100 larges private sector companies.17 Unlike he developmen on he executive boards, he share of women on supervisory boards in he financial sector barely increased; however, as in he other groups of companies, he increases occurred a a markedly higher level. The share of women on he supervisory boards of he 100 larges banks grew by a good half percentage poin o around 27 percent. The share of women on he supervisory boards of he 60 larges insurance companies in he final quarter of 2023 15 I should be noted ha scientific directors of companies focused on research were counted as CEOs in his edition of he Women Executives Barometer, as hey have a greater influence on he company’s conten strategy han administrative directors.

This law states, among other hings, ha publicly listed companies with full co-determination whose executive board has a leas four members mus have a leas one executive board position filled by a member of he under­ represented gender. 20 As of late fall 2023, 63 companies are required o comply with his regulation. These companies had, on average, a share of a good 21 percen women on heir executive boards (Table 6). Thus, his group of companies is behind companies with government-owned shares (34 per­ cent) and jus behind he DAX 40 companies (23 percent), bu is ahead of he res of he groups examined here. The compa­ nies subjec o he gender quota for supervisory boards had an average share of women supervisory board members of nearly 38 percent, hus pu ing his group slightly behind he companies with government-owned shares (a solid 39 per­ cent) and he DAX 40 companies (jus over 38 percent), bu ahead of all other groups of companies. The positive effects of he legal requirements for women on these boards are becoming visible over ime as he shares of women grow: Within he 200 larges companies, a com­ parison of he companies ha are subjec o he supervisory board quota with he companies no subjec o i shows ha there has been a signifcantly stronger increase in he share of women in he “quota companies,” especially from 2014 o 2019 as well as since 2021 (Figure 3). Since 2014, he share of women on he supervisory boards of he companies sub­ jec o he quota (quota companies) among he 200 larges companies has increased",
    "by over 17 percentage points (from around 20 o nearly 37 percent). Among he companies in he top 200 group no subjec o he quota, he share of women on supervisory boards only increased by around 12 perent­ age points (from almos 16 o around 28 percent) in he same period of ime and was, as of late fall 2023, nearly en per­ centage points lower han he share of women in he quota companies. There has been barely any growth in he non- quota companies over he pas years, while he quota com­ panies have clearly continued o strive for gender parity even after reaching he legal minimum of 30 percent. The inclusion requiremen for executive boards introduced in 2021 is also clearly having an impact: From 2017 o 2020, the share of women on executive boards of he companies in the op 200 group ha would later be subjec o he require­ men as well as hose ha would no be subjec o he require­ men developed a he same pace (Figure 4).

Conclusion: Companies need more commi men to gender parity internally and externally From 2022 o 2023, he share of women on he executive boards of he larges companies in Germany increased in all groups of companies analyzed. In particular, companies in fall 2021.21 Of he companies in he op 200 group ha are subjec o he inclusion requirement, he share of women on executive boards was recently 22 percent, which is an over eight-percentage-poin increase since 2020.

Since 2020, i has increased by around six percentage points, making he gap between the wo groups a li le over five percentage points (instead of under hree percentage points in 2020).

However, in his group of compa­ nies, as in mos of he others, he number of women remains a one. Among he 200 larges companies, for example, here is still a significan share of executive boards withou a single woman, around 44 percent. Moreover, he position of CEO remains heavily dominated by men: Only nine women were the CEO of a op 200 company as of late fall 2023; among the DAX 40 companies, only one woman had his position. No only is he share of women CEOs still negligible, here is no even an upward rend discernable—rather he opposite. Much suggests ha he introduction of an inclusion require­ men for executive boards has led o he establishmen of a new social norm. The arge of zero women on he executive board se by many companies a few years ago22 has appar­ ently been replaced by a arge of one woman on he execu­ tive board. Media coverage and public debate contribute o the formation of such an implici quota as a social norm.23 While boards consisting only of men are no longer considered 22 AllBrigh Stiftung, Zielgröße: Null Frauen. Die verschenkte Chance deutscher Unternehmen (2016) (in German; available online). 23 Studies on US American companies have shown such an implici quota has become estab­ lished here oo, see Cristian L. Dezs˝o, David Gaddis Ross, and Jose Uribe, “Is here an implici quota on women in op management?

In addition, an implici quota seems o be emerging in other contexts such as science, cf. Lena Janys, “Testing he presence of implici hiring quotas with application o German universities,” Review of Economics and Statistics (2022) (available online).

Figure 5 Companies by number of women on he executive board Shares in percent Source: Authors’ surveys and calculations. © DIW Berlin 2024 Of he companies subjec o he inclusion requiremen for executive boards, he majority have since appointed a leas one woman.

Withers e al., “Upper echelon employment: A review of he fundamental questions related o he executive labor market,” Journal of Managemen 50, no. 1 (2024): 71–121 (available online). adequate, here is a danger ha he new social norm will legit­ imize boards with a low share of women. Companies may have li le motivation o appoin more women once hey have reached a minimum level of gender diversity, and hereby keep women underrepresented on executive boards. To achieve equal participation of women and men on execu­ tive boards, more commitmen is required, both within com­ panies and without. When filling executive board positions via executive search firms, which play an importan role as gatekeepers, supervisory boards can require hem o search specifically for women candidates. Furthermore, supervisory boards can demand ha heir executive boards implemen JEL: D22, J16, J59, J78, L21, L32, M14, M51 Keywords: corporate boards, board composition, boards of directors, board diversity, Europe, women directors, executive directors, gender equality, gender quota, Germany, management, private companies, public companies, supervisory boards, executive boards, CEOs, women, finance industry, financial sector, private and public banks, insurance companies Virginia Sondergeld is a Research Associate in he Gender Economic Research Group a DIW Berlin |",
