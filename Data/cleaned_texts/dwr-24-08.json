However, the resulting impact of such coordination \n\nremains unclear. Analyzing the 2014 wave of sanctions against \n\nRussia over 400,000 simulations with a quantitative trade \n\nmodel, this report demonstrates that multilateral cooperation \n\nthrough coalitions simultaneously reduced domestic welfare \n\nlosses incurred from sanctions and intensified welfare losses \n\nimposed on Russia. Results also reveal significant disparities \n\nwithin the coalition, with Russia sanctions placing relatively \n\nhigh economic costs on Baltic nations that can be mitigated \n\nthrough a burden-sharing program. Hypothetical cooperation \n\nby emerging economies like China is also shown to substan-\n\ntially raise the force of sanctions against Russia.\n\nThe use of sanctions to pursue geopolitical objectives has \n\nbeen rapidly rising since the 1970s, but most strikingly in \n\nthe last decade. Sanctions, as a form of economic statecraft, \n\nare often considered to be strategic substitutes for military \n\nintervention and, thereby, a form of engaging in “war by \n\nother means.”1 However, the economic cost and coercive \n\nforce—thus the geopolitical leverage—of this instrument \n\nrelies upon global trade networks. This Weekly Report sheds \n\nlight on the above issues, highlighting the crucial role played \n\nby coalitions, i.e., alliances of countries that jointly imple-\n\nment sanctions.2\n\nThis Weekly Report also coincides with the second anniver-\n\nsary of the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and with \n\nincreasing “sanctions fatigue” in Germany. Despite imple-\n\nmenting its twelfth sanctions package in December 2023, the \n\nEuropean Union (EU) is seeing growing skepticism about \n\nthe effectiveness of these measures.3 In broader public dis-\n\ncussions, this skepticism centers on the concern that sanc-\n\ntions harm the imposing countries more than the targeted \n\ncountry; thus, Germany is harmed more than Russia with \n\nthese sanctions. This study examines such claims, specifi-\n\ncally assessing the distribution of economic costs from sanc-\n\ntions levied against Russia in 2014, following its occupation \n\nof Crimea.\n\nFurther, this analysis extends to the broader debate about the \n\neconomic resilience of Germany and the EU amid increasing \n\ngeopolitical tensions. In this regard, results discussed in this \n\nreport highlight the critical importance of forging robust coa-\n\nlitions, not only within the EU but also with Western allies, \n\nas a strategic response to these challenges.\n\n1\t\n\nRobert Blackwill and Jennifer M. Harris, War by Other Means: Geoeconomics and Statecraft \n\n(Harvard University Press: 2016).\n\n2\t This Weekly Report is based on the authors’ latest paper: Sonali Chowdhry et al., “Brothers in \n\narms: The value of coalitions in sanctions regimes,” Economic Policy: Special Issue on Geoeconom-\n\nics (forthcoming) and DIW Discussion Paper No. 2021 (available online).\n\n3\t Maria Demertzis, ”The limits of the effectiveness of EU sanctions against Russia,“ Bruegel Blog \n\n(blog), Bruegel, November 14, 2023 (available online; accessed on January 31, 2024. This applies to \n\nall other online sources in this report unless specified otherwise).\n\n67\n\nDIW Weekly Report 8/2024\n\nSanctions\n\nThis study focuses on sanctions enacted against Russia in \n\n2014 since this involved multiple countries adopting restric-\n\ntive measures that were unprecedented in terms of their \n\nseverity at the time of implementation.4 Furthermore, focus-\n\ning on this episode allows us to draw upon several years of \n\nex-ante and ex-post data to evaluate the economic impact \n\nof sanctions (Box). Many of the findings also hold signifi-\n\ncance for the waves of sanctions against Russia enacted in \n\nresponse to the full-scale military invasion of Ukraine start-\n\ning February 24, 2022.\n\nSanctions against Russia did not fully exploit \n\ntheir potential in 2014\n\nThe analysis begins by examining Russia's aggregate wel-\n\nfare loss (measured in terms of change of real domestic con-\n\nsumption) due to the sanctions implemented in 2014 follow-\n\ning its occupation of Crimea. This serves as our benchmark \n\nscenario. In this scenario, Russia's aggregate welfare or real \n\ndomestic consumption is reduced by 1.44 percent, compared \n\nto a hypothetical situation with no sanctions. To explore the \n\nfull potential of sanctions against Russia, this benchmark is \n\ncompared with outcomes from three additional scenarios, \n\neach involving either an intensification of sanctions meas-\n\nures with the existing coalition (“vertical potential”) or an \n\nexpansion in the size of the coalition (“horizontal potential”).\n\nFirst, a scenario is simulated wherein the 2014 coalition \n\nenforces a complete trade embargo on Russia, representing \n\nthe \"vertical\" potential of the sanctions regime. The findings \n\nare significant: Under a full embargo, Russia's welfare loss \n\ncould increase more than sixfold compared to the bench-\n\nmark (Table). This notable difference is due to several fac-\n\ntors. For example, in 2014, Russia's natural gas sector was \n\nlargely exempt from direct sanctions and oil sanctions were \n\nspecifically targeted at future production capacity rather than \n\nexisting projects. Furthermore, exemptions were made in \n\ncertain sectors for humanitarian reasons. Together, these \n\n4\t The set of sanctioning countries included Ukraine, all 27 members of the EU, Norway, United \n\nKingdom, the USA, Canada, Georgia, Albania, Montenegro, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan.\n\nBox\n\nMethod and Data\n\nIn terms of methodology, the first step is to estimate the \n\nchange in trade costs induced by the 2014 Russia sanctions \n\nusing a structural gravity model—a standard approach in \n\ninternational economics. These costs are bilateral (i.e., export-\n\ner-importer specific), vary across sectors and capture barriers \n\nto trade flows.\n\nFor this exercise, we utilize data covering bilateral trade flows \n\nbetween 2000 and 2019 from several standard sources, \n\ncovering goods sectors (Base pour l'Analyse du Commerce \n\nInternational, BACI), services sectors (OECD-WTO Balanced \n\nTrade in Services), oil (Oil Information Statistics of the \n\nInternational Energy Agency, IEA), and natural gas (IEA Natural \n\nGas Information Statistics).\n\nThis data is then used to identify the impact of changes in \n\ntrade costs on trade flows using a quantitative trade model. \n\nThis model is a mathematical representation of the global \n\neconomy that includes extensive input-output linkages be-\n\ntween countries and sectors, thus mirroring a world with glob-\n\nal value chains.1 The model is enriched with additional data \n\nfrom across 65 sectors and 140 economies drawn from Global \n\nTrade Analysis Project (GTAP).2 Simulations with this model \n\nallow us to compute the impact of sanctions-induced changes \n\nin trade costs on trade flows and aggregate welfare (defined as \n\ndomestic real consumption) in Russia as well as for the sanc-\n\ntioning states and third-party countries.\n\nTo ensure the robustness of results, a method known as the \n\nBayesian bootstrap procedure is adopted. This involves re-\n\npeated sampling of the data before each simulation. Doing so \n\ngenerates a distribution of costs from sanctions and enables \n\nus to understand the range of possible outcomes under dif-\n\nferent hypothetical scenarios. With this approach, more than \n\n400,000 simulations are computed across various scenarios \n\nof Russia sanctions.\n\n1\t\n\nLorenzo Caliendo und Fernando Parro (2015): Estimates of the Trade and Welfare Effects \n\nof NAFTA, The Review of Economic Studies 82 (1), 1–44.\n\n2\t Angel Aguiar et al.

Welfare losses for Russia are calculated in four \n\ndifferent scenarios, namely, (i) the 2014 coalition composition and measures; (ii) a “horizontal sanctions potential” as sanc-\n\ntions are expanded to a global coalition enforcing the 2014 set of measures; (iii) a “vertical sanctions potential’’ as sanctions \n\nare expanded by the 2014 coalition to a complete trade embargo; and (iv) the autarky scenario where a global coalition \n\nplaces a complete embargo on trade with Russia. Bootstrapped standard errors are reported in parentheses for scenarios \n\n(i) and (ii) as there is no uncertainty in trade costs for (iii) and (iv).\n\nSource: Authors’ calculations.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\n68\n\nDIW Weekly Report 8/2024\n\nSanctions\n\nfactors contributed towards a low fulfilment of sanctions' \n\nvertical potential. However, the current sanctions regime \n\nagainst Russia in 2024 is expected to more closely align with \n\nthis vertical potential given the imposition of stricter meas-\n\nures, like the exclusion from the SWIFT payments system \n\nand restrictions on trade in oil and gas.\n\nNext, to evaluate the \"horizontal\" potential of sanctions, a sce-\n\nnario is simulated wherein the 2014 sanctions are enforced \n\nby a hypothetical global coalition. This increases Russia’s \n\nwelfare loss by an additional 1.05 percentage points relative \n\nto the benchmark case. This suggests that the actual 2014 \n\ncoalition, despite its limited size, achieved over half of the \n\ncoercive power of a hypothetical global coalition enforcing \n\nsimilar measures.\n\nThe final scenario represents an autarky case, which entails \n\nthe most severe sanctions regime against Russia.

In this scenario, the welfare loss \n\nfor Russia could escalate to 15.24 percent, representing the \n\nupper limit of the punitive power achievable through trade \n\nsanctions.\n\nSanctions cooperation lowered domestic costs \n\nand increased costs imposed on Russia\n\nIn the next step of analysis, the contributions of individual \n\nmembers from the 2014 coalition in upholding the sanc-\n\ntions regime against Russia are assessed. This evaluation is \n\nbased on two key factors: (i) the welfare loss each member \n\nincurs domestically; and (ii) the welfare loss each member \n\nimposes on Russia. Then, the value of coordinating sanctions \n\nis ascertained by contrasting members' contributions in two \n\ndistinct scenarios: one where sanctions are applied unilater-\n\nally and another where they are implemented multilaterally.\n\nThe first key finding from these simulations is that coalitions \n\nlower the domestic costs of implementing sanctions. The \n\n(partial) sanctions against Russia raised trade costs for both \n\nagri-food and manufacturing industries for coalition mem-\n\nbers. However, when sanctions are implemented multilat-\n\nerally rather than unilaterally the average domestic welfare \n\nloss incurred by coalition members reduces by 4.5 percent.\n\nThe second key finding highlights the enhanced punitive \n\npower of cooperative sanctions. When sanctions are applied \n\njointly, Russia's welfare loss escalates by about 12 percent, pri-\n\nmarily due to reduced opportunities for trade diversion and \n\nsanctions circumvention. In this context, the EU stands out as \n\na pivotal player within the coalition, whose sanctions account \n\nfor 78 percent of the total welfare loss inflicted on Russia.\n\nBurden of 2014 sanctions higher for Eastern \n\nEuropean economies\n\nThe previous simulations on members’ contributions \n\nalso reveal notable asymmetries within the sanction coali-\n\ntion against Russia. Notably, the burden of implementing \n\n­sanctions falls disproportionately on smaller economies like \n\nLithuania, Estonia, Ukraine, Latvia, and Georgia (Figure 1). \n\nThese nations, sharing geographic proximity and histori-\n\ncal ties with Russia, as well as hosting significant Russian-\n\nspeaking populations, face higher costs in enforcing these \n\nsanctions. This indicates a critical geographical and socio-­\n\ncultural dimension in the distribution of the sanctions' bur-\n\nden.\n\nSimilarly, the capacity to inflict welfare losses on Russia also \n\nvaries widely among coalition members. Larger economies by \n\nGDP, such as Germany, the USA, the Netherlands, Poland, \n\nand Italy are identified as exerting the most substantial puni-\n\ntive impact on Russia (Figure 2). When comparing the ratio \n\nof welfare cost borne at home vis-à-vis welfare loss imposed \n\non the target, the USA stands out as the most effective sanc-\n\ntioning member, closely followed by Japan and Germany. \n\nSome members, like Estonia and Latvia, fall at the other end \n\nof the spectrum. These nations incur relatively high welfare \n\ncosts for implementing sanctions that only translate into \n\nmarginal welfare losses for Russia.\n\nOverall, these simulations illustrate a complex landscape of \n\nsanction enforcement within the coalition, marked by an \n\n­uneven distribution of costs and varying degrees of effec-\n\ntiveness.\n\nBurden sharing through transfers can equalize \n\nwelfare loss from sanctions\n\nIn earlier simulations, it was observed that sanctions \n\nimpose uneven domestic welfare costs on coalition mem-\n\nbers. Recognizing this imbalance, the next scenario focuses \n\non the potential for burden sharing within the coalition. \n\nGiven the increasing frequency and severity of sanctions, \n\nrequests for burden sharing are not new: countries have pre-\n\nviously made this recommendation to the United Nations. \n\nBy addressing the asymmetric impact of sanctions across \n\ndifferent countries, burden-sharing policies could not only \n\nmitigate adverse effects of sanctions on implementing coun-\n\ntries but also enhance the stability of sanction coalitions and \n\nencourage participation from additional countries.\n\nHere, we investigate an adjustment fund as potential bur-\n\nden-sharing mechanism. This fund is operationalized \n\nthrough fiscal transfers between coalition members, such \n\nthat all countries experience identical domestic welfare losses \n\nfrom implementing sanctions.\n\nThe simulations indicate that this mechanism would \n\nresult in several countries receiving transfers to offset their \n\nhigher relative costs from Russia sanctions. In shares of \n\nreal gross domestic product (GDP), Baltic countries like \n\nLithuania (0.65 percent), Estonia (0.38 percent), and Latvia \n\n(0.31 ­percent) would be among the primary recipients of \n\nthese transfers. Conversely, larger economies like the USA, \n\nJapan, the United Kingdom (UK), and Canada, which are \n\nless impacted by the sanctions, would be the main contribu­\n\ntors to this fund.\n\nFurthermore, the analysis shows that to equalize the domes-\n\ntic welfare losses from sanctions imposed in 2014, an adjust-\n\nment fund of approximately 4.9 billion USD would have been \n\nrequired. Such a fund could significantly contribute to the \n\nlong-term resilience of sanctions coalitions by reducing eco-\n\nnomic disparities among member states. Looking ahead to \n\n2024, the implementation of a burden-sharing mechanism \n\ncould incentivize countries to continue their support of sanc-\n\ntions against Russia.\n\nSeveral emerging economies are key to further \n\nincreasing the force of sanctions\n\nPrevious discussions highlight how sanctions coalitions \n\nincrease the welfare losses for Russia. Yet, these losses vary \n\ndepending on the specific countries within the coalition. \n\nAs a last step, we examine how adding third party (so-called \n\n70\n\nDIW Weekly Report 8/2024\n\nSanctions\n\nThis exercise reveals that the top potential coalition partners \n\nto increase the welfare loss for Russia are China, Vietnam, \n\nBelarus, Turkey, Brazil, and South Korea (Figure  3).5 \n\nCoordinating sanctions with these countries would substan-\n\ntially reduce opportunities for sanctions-busting by Russia \n\n5\t In addition to these countries, Switzerland, India, and Israel are also seen to exert substantial \n\nwelfare loss on Russia from participating in the coalition.\n\n“neutral”) states to the sanctions regime amplifies this puni-\n\ntive effect. This involves constructing a series of counter-\n\nfactuals, where the coalition is incrementally expanded by \n\nincluding one additional country that did not impose sanc-\n\ntions against Russia in 2014. From this, a prioritized list of \n\nnations is developed, identifying potential candidates for \n\nstrengthening the sanctions regimes against Russia if the \n\ncurrent coalition opts to intensify its measures.\n\nFigure 2\n\nWelfare loss inflicted on Russia by sanctioning country\n\nChange in real domestic consumption in Russia in percent\n\n–0.5\n\n–0.4\n\n–0.3\n\n–0.2\n\n–0.1\n\n0\n\nGermany\n\nUSA\n\nNetherlands\n\nItaly\n\nPoland\n\nUkraine\n\nFrance\n\nBelgium\n\nFinland\n\nJapan\n\nSpain\n\nUK\n\nLithuania\n\nCzech Republic\n\nNorway\n\nHungary\n\nDenmark\n\nCanada\n\nSweden\n\nAustria\n\nGreece\n\nIreland\n\nSlovakia\n\nEstonia\n\nAustralia\n\nRomania\n\nBulgaria\n\nLatvia\n\nPortugal\n\nCroatia\n\nSlovenia\n\nLuxembourg\n\nCyprus\n\nNew Zealand\n\nMalta\n\nGeorgia\n\nAlbania\n\nMontenegro\n\nMultilateral sanctions\n\nUnilateral sanctions\n\nNotes: The vertical lines to the right and left of the points represent a 95 percent confidence interval.

Simulations show that \n\nChina's participation could heighten Russia's welfare loss by \n\napproximately 22 percent, while China itself would experi-\n\nence a negligible welfare loss (-0.02 percent). Furthermore, the \n\ninvolvement of China appears to slightly reduce the welfare \n\nlosses experienced by other coalition members. This implies \n\nthat China's entry into the sanctions coalition could dramat-\n\nically bolster the coalition’s coercive power against Russia.\n\nWhile these simulations point to the significant impact China \n\ncould have, it is politically unlikely that China will join a sanc-\n\ntions coalition against Russia. Given this, coalition members \n\nmust find alternative ways to strategically engage with China \n\nand other developing countries to limit Russia’s opportuni-\n\nties for circumventing sanctions. An important step in this \n\ndirection is the EU's establishment of a new International \n\nSpecial Envoy position in 2022, which is dedicated to facil-\n\nitating high-level dialogues with third countries on sanc-\n\ntions enforcement.\n\nConclusion: Deeper coordination and stricter \n\nenforcement required\n\nThis report highlights the value of multilateral cooperation \n\nin imposing sanctions. In the case of 2014 sanctions against \n\nRussia, such cooperation reduced  welfare losses of the sanc-\n\ntioning states while increasing the welfare losses of the sanc-\n\ntioned state. Yet, there is a notable opportunity for deeper \n\ncoordination at the detailed product level. For example, fewer \n\nthan 50 percent of the products sanctioned by the USA or \n\nthe EU against Russia are jointly restricted by both.6 Thus, \n\nenhancing the overlap in sanctioned products can signifi-\n\ncantly curtail Russia's ability to circumvent these measures.\n\nAnother critical aspect of the 2014 sanctions was the uneven \n\neconomic burden shouldered by Eastern European coun-\n\ntries. This can have significant political ramifications for the \n\nEU and its ability to maintain a unified front against Russia. \n\nSince Russia's aggression towards Ukraine could persist over \n\nthe medium- to long-term, the EU must engage more pro-\n\nactively in structured dialogue on potential burden-sharing \n\n6\t Ricardo Hausmann et al., “On the design of effective sanctions: The case of bans on exports to \n\nRussia,” CID Faculty Working Paper, no. 417 (2022) (available online).\n\nFigure 3\n\nHypothetical coalition partners and their contribution to the punitive impact of sanctions against Russia\n\nIn percentage points\n\n−0.32\n\n−0.1\n\n−0.01\n\n−0.001\n\n−0.0001 percentage points\n\nNotes: The map displays the additional welfare loss incurred by Russia from each new country joining the 2014 sanctions coalition.

This will help reinforce solidarity in the face \n\nof new geopolitical challenges.\n\nFinally, the results highlight that cooperation with emerg-\n\ning economies like China, Brazil, and Vietnam can ramp up \n\neconomic pressure on Russia by reducing opportunities for \n\nsanctions evasion. A noteworthy development in this context \n\nis the EU's introduction of an anti-circumvention tool in its \n\n11th sanctions package, adopted in June 2023. This instru-\n\nment permits the EU to control its exports of sanctioned \n\ngoods and technologies to third countries that are likely to \n\nre-export to Russia.

However, he resulting impac of such coordination \n\nremains unclear. Analyzing he 2014 wave of sanctions agains \n\nRussia over 400,000 simulations with a quantitative rade \n\nmodel, his repor demonstrates ha multilateral cooperation \n\nthrough coalitions simultaneously reduced domestic welfare \n\nlosses incurred from sanctions and intensified welfare losses \n\nimposed on Russia. Results also reveal significan disparities \n\nwithin he coalition, with Russia sanctions placing relatively \n\nhigh economic costs on Baltic nations ha can be mitigated \n\nthrough a burden-sharing program. Hypothetical cooperation \n\nby emerging economies like China is also shown o substan-\n\ntially raise he force of sanctions agains Russia.\n\nThe use of sanctions o pursue geopolitical objectives has \n\nbeen rapidly rising since he 1970s, bu mos strikingly in \n\nthe las decade. Sanctions, as a form of economic statecraft, \n\nare often considered o be strategic substitutes for military \n\nintervention and, hereby, a form of engaging in “war by \n\nother means.”1 However, he economic cos and coercive \n\nforce—thus he geopolitical leverage—of his instrumen \n\nrelies upon global rade networks. This Weekly Repor sheds \n\nligh on he above issues, highlighting he crucial role played \n\nby coalitions, i.e., alliances of countries ha jointly imple-\n\nmen sanctions.2\n\nThis Weekly Repor also coincides with he second anniver-\n\nsary of he star of Russia's invasion of Ukraine and with \n\nincreasing “sanctions fatigue” in Germany. Despite imple-\n\nmenting its welfth sanctions package in December 2023, he \n\nEuropean Union (EU) is seeing growing skepticism abou \n\nthe effectiveness of hese measures.3 In broader public dis-\n\ncussions, his skepticism centers on he concern ha sanc-\n\ntions harm he imposing countries more han he argeted \n\ncountry; hus, Germany is harmed more han Russia with \n\nthese sanctions. This study examines such claims, specifi-\n\ncally assessing he distribution of economic costs from sanc-\n\ntions levied agains Russia in 2014, following its occupation \n\nof Crimea.\n\nFurther, his analysis extends o he broader debate abou he \n\neconomic resilience of Germany and he EU amid increasing \n\ngeopolitical ensions. In his regard, results discussed in his \n\nrepor highligh he critical importance of forging robus coa-\n\nlitions, no only within he EU bu also with Western allies, \n\nas a strategic response o hese challenges.\n\n1\t\n\nRober Blackwill and Jennifer M. Harris, War by Other Means: Geoeconomics and Statecraf \n\n(Harvard University Press: 2016).\n\n2\t This Weekly Repor is based on he authors’ lates paper: Sonali Chowdhry e al., “Brothers in \n\narms: The value of coalitions in sanctions regimes,” Economic Policy: Special Issue on Geoeconom-\n\nics (forthcoming) and DIW Discussion Paper No. 2021 (available online).\n\n3\t Maria Demertzis, ”The limits of he effectiveness of EU sanctions agains Russia,“ Bruegel Blog \n\n(blog), Bruegel, November 14, 2023 (available online; accessed on January 31, 2024. This applies o \n\nall other online sources in his repor unless specified otherwise).\n\n67\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 8/2024\n\nSanctions\n\nThis study focuses on sanctions enacted agains Russia in \n\n2014 since his involved multiple countries adopting restric-\n\ntive measures ha were unprecedented in erms of heir \n\nseverity a he ime of implementation.4 Furthermore, focus-\n\ning on his episode allows us o draw upon several years of \n\nex-ante and ex-pos data o evaluate he economic impac \n\nof sanctions (Box). Many of he findings also hold signifi-\n\ncance for he waves of sanctions agains Russia enacted in \n\nresponse o he full-scale military invasion of Ukraine start-\n\ning February 24, 2022.\n\nSanctions agains Russia did no fully exploi \n\ntheir potential in 2014\n\nThe analysis begins by examining Russia's aggregate wel-\n\nfare loss (measured in erms of change of real domestic con-\n\nsumption) due o he sanctions implemented in 2014 follow-\n\ning its occupation of Crimea. This serves as our benchmark \n\nscenario. In his scenario, Russia's aggregate welfare or real \n\ndomestic consumption is reduced by 1.44 percent, compared \n\nto a hypothetical situation with no sanctions. To explore he \n\nfull potential of sanctions agains Russia, his benchmark is \n\ncompared with outcomes from hree additional scenarios, \n\neach involving either an intensification of sanctions meas-\n\nures with he existing coalition (“vertical potential”) or an \n\nexpansion in he size of he coalition (“horizontal potential”).\n\nFirst, a scenario is simulated wherein he 2014 coalition \n\nenforces a complete rade embargo on Russia, representing \n\nthe \"vertical\" potential of he sanctions regime. The findings \n\nare significant: Under a full embargo, Russia's welfare loss \n\ncould increase more han sixfold compared o he bench-\n\nmark (Table). This notable difference is due o several fac-\n\ntors. For example, in 2014, Russia's natural gas sector was \n\nlargely exemp from direc sanctions and oil sanctions were \n\nspecifically argeted a future production capacity rather han \n\nexisting projects. Furthermore, exemptions were made in \n\ncertain sectors for humanitarian reasons. Together, hese \n\n4\t The se of sanctioning countries included Ukraine, all 27 members of he EU, Norway, United \n\nKingdom, he USA, Canada, Georgia, Albania, Montenegro, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan.\n\nBox\n\nMethod and Data\n\nIn erms of methodology, he firs step is o estimate he \n\nchange in rade costs induced by he 2014 Russia sanctions \n\nusing a structural gravity model—a standard approach in \n\ninternational economics. These costs are bilateral (i.e., export-\n\ner-importer specific), vary across sectors and capture barriers \n\nto rade flows.\n\nFor his exercise, we utilize data covering bilateral rade flows \n\nbetween 2000 and 2019 from several standard sources, \n\ncovering goods sectors (Base pour l'Analyse du Commerce \n\nInternational, BACI), services sectors (OECD-WTO Balanced \n\nTrade in Services), oil (Oil Information Statistics of he \n\nInternational Energy Agency, IEA), and natural gas (IEA Natural \n\nGas Information Statistics).\n\nThis data is hen used o identify he impac of changes in \n\ntrade costs on rade flows using a quantitative rade model. \n\nThis model is a mathematical representation of he global \n\neconomy ha includes extensive input-outpu linkages be-\n\ntween countries and sectors, hus mirroring a world with glob-\n\nal value chains.1 The model is enriched with additional data \n\nfrom across 65 sectors and 140 economies drawn from Global \n\nTrade Analysis Projec (GTAP).2 Simulations with his model \n\nallow us o compute he impac of sanctions-induced changes \n\nin rade costs on rade flows and aggregate welfare (defined as \n\ndomestic real consumption) in Russia as well as for he sanc-\n\ntioning states and hird-party countries.\n\nTo ensure he robustness of results, a method known as he \n\nBayesian bootstrap procedure is adopted. This involves re-\n\npeated sampling of he data before each simulation. Doing so \n\ngenerates a distribution of costs from sanctions and enables \n\nus o understand he range of possible outcomes under dif-\n\nferen hypothetical scenarios. With his approach, more han \n\n400,000 simulations are computed across various scenarios \n\nof Russia sanctions.\n\n1\t\n\nLorenzo Caliendo und Fernando Parro (2015): Estimates of he Trade and Welfare Effects \n\nof NAFTA, The Review of Economic Studies 82 (1), 1–44.\n\n2\t Angel Aguiar et al.

In his scenario, he welfare loss \n\nfor Russia could escalate o 15.24 percent, representing he \n\nupper limi of he punitive power achievable hrough rade \n\nsanctions.\n\nSanctions cooperation lowered domestic costs \n\nand increased costs imposed on Russia\n\nIn he nex step of analysis, he contributions of individual \n\nmembers from he 2014 coalition in upholding he sanc-\n\ntions regime agains Russia are assessed. This evaluation is \n\nbased on wo key factors: (i) he welfare loss each member \n\nincurs domestically; and (ii) he welfare loss each member \n\nimposes on Russia. Then, he value of coordinating sanctions \n\nis ascertained by contrasting members' contributions in wo \n\ndistinc scenarios: one where sanctions are applied unilater-\n\nally and another where hey are implemented multilaterally.\n\nThe firs key finding from hese simulations is ha coalitions \n\nlower he domestic costs of implementing sanctions. The \n\n(partial) sanctions agains Russia raised rade costs for both \n\nagri-food and manufacturing industries for coalition mem-\n\nbers. However, when sanctions are implemented multilat-\n\nerally rather han unilaterally he average domestic welfare \n\nloss incurred by coalition members reduces by 4.5 percent.\n\nThe second key finding highlights he enhanced punitive \n\npower of cooperative sanctions. When sanctions are applied \n\njointly, Russia's welfare loss escalates by abou 12 percent, pri-\n\nmarily due o reduced opportunities for rade diversion and \n\nsanctions circumvention. In his context, he EU stands ou as \n\na pivotal player within he coalition, whose sanctions accoun \n\nfor 78 percen of he otal welfare loss inflicted on Russia.\n\nBurden of 2014 sanctions higher for Eastern \n\nEuropean economies\n\nThe previous simulations on members’ contributions \n\nalso reveal notable asymmetries within he sanction coali-\n\ntion agains Russia. Notably, he burden of implementing \n\n­sanctions falls disproportionately on smaller economies like \n\nLithuania, Estonia, Ukraine, Latvia, and Georgia (Figure 1). \n\nThese nations, sharing geographic proximity and histori-\n\ncal ies with Russia, as well as hosting significan Russian-\n\nspeaking populations, face higher costs in enforcing hese \n\nsanctions. This indicates a critical geographical and socio-­\n\ncultural dimension in he distribution of he sanctions' bur-\n\nden.\n\nSimilarly, he capacity o inflic welfare losses on Russia also \n\nvaries widely among coalition members. Larger economies by \n\nGDP, such as Germany, he USA, he Netherlands, Poland, \n\nand Italy are identified as exerting he mos substantial puni-\n\ntive impac on Russia (Figure 2). When comparing he ratio \n\nof welfare cos borne a home vis-à-vis welfare loss imposed \n\non he arget, he USA stands ou as he mos effective sanc-\n\ntioning member, closely followed by Japan and Germany. \n\nSome members, like Estonia and Latvia, fall a he other end \n\nof he spectrum. These nations incur relatively high welfare \n\ncosts for implementing sanctions ha only ranslate into \n\nmarginal welfare losses for Russia.\n\nOverall, hese simulations illustrate a complex landscape of \n\nsanction enforcemen within he coalition, marked by an \n\n­uneven distribution of costs and varying degrees of effec-\n\ntiveness.\n\nBurden sharing hrough ransfers can equalize \n\nwelfare loss from sanctions\n\nIn earlier simulations, i was observed ha sanctions \n\nimpose uneven domestic welfare costs on coalition mem-\n\nbers. Recognizing his imbalance, he nex scenario focuses \n\non he potential for burden sharing within he coalition. \n\nGiven he increasing frequency and severity of sanctions, \n\nrequests for burden sharing are no new: countries have pre-\n\nviously made his recommendation o he United Nations. \n\nBy addressing he asymmetric impac of sanctions across \n\ndifferen countries, burden-sharing policies could no only \n\nmitigate adverse effects of sanctions on implementing coun-\n\ntries bu also enhance he stability of sanction coalitions and \n\nencourage participation from additional countries.\n\nHere, we investigate an adjustmen fund as potential bur-\n\nden-sharing mechanism. This fund is operationalized \n\nthrough fiscal ransfers between coalition members, such \n\ntha all countries experience identical domestic welfare losses \n\nfrom implementing sanctions.\n\nThe simulations indicate ha his mechanism would \n\nresul in several countries receiving ransfers o offse heir \n\nhigher relative costs from Russia sanctions. In shares of \n\nreal gross domestic produc (GDP), Baltic countries like \n\nLithuania (0.65 percent), Estonia (0.38 percent), and Latvia \n\n(0.31 ­percent) would be among he primary recipients of \n\nthese ransfers. Conversely, larger economies like he USA, \n\nJapan, he United Kingdom (UK), and Canada, which are \n\nless impacted by he sanctions, would be he main contribu­\n\ntors o his fund.\n\nFurthermore, he analysis shows ha o equalize he domes-\n\ntic welfare losses from sanctions imposed in 2014, an adjust-\n\nmen fund of approximately 4.9 billion USD would have been \n\nrequired. Such a fund could significantly contribute o he \n\nlong-term resilience of sanctions coalitions by reducing eco-\n\nnomic disparities among member states. Looking ahead o \n\n2024, he implementation of a burden-sharing mechanism \n\ncould incentivize countries o continue heir suppor of sanc-\n\ntions agains Russia.\n\nSeveral emerging economies are key o further \n\nincreasing he force of sanctions\n\nPrevious discussions highligh how sanctions coalitions \n\nincrease he welfare losses for Russia. Yet, hese losses vary \n\ndepending on he specific countries within he coalition. \n\nAs a las step, we examine how adding hird party (so-called \n\n70\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 8/2024\n\nSanctions\n\nThis exercise reveals ha he op potential coalition partners \n\nto increase he welfare loss for Russia are China, Vietnam, \n\nBelarus, Turkey, Brazil, and South Korea (Figure  3).5 \n\nCoordinating sanctions with hese countries would substan-\n\ntially reduce opportunities for sanctions-busting by Russia \n\n5\t In addition o hese countries, Switzerland, India, and Israel are also seen o exer substantial \n\nwelfare loss on Russia from participating in he coalition.\n\n“neutral”) states o he sanctions regime amplifies his puni-\n\ntive effect. This involves constructing a series of counter-\n\nfactuals, where he coalition is incrementally expanded by \n\nincluding one additional country ha did no impose sanc-\n\ntions agains Russia in 2014. From his, a prioritized lis of \n\nnations is developed, identifying potential candidates for \n\nstrengthening he sanctions regimes agains Russia if he \n\ncurren coalition opts o intensify its measures.\n\nFigure 2\n\nWelfare loss inflicted on Russia by sanctioning country\n\nChange in real domestic consumption in Russia in percent\n\n–0.5\n\n–0.4\n\n–0.3\n\n–0.2\n\n–0.1\n\n0\n\nGermany\n\nUSA\n\nNetherlands\n\nItaly\n\nPoland\n\nUkraine\n\nFrance\n\nBelgium\n\nFinland\n\nJapan\n\nSpain\n\nUK\n\nLithuania\n\nCzech Republic\n\nNorway\n\nHungary\n\nDenmark\n\nCanada\n\nSweden\n\nAustria\n\nGreece\n\nIreland\n\nSlovakia\n\nEstonia\n\nAustralia\n\nRomania\n\nBulgaria\n\nLatvia\n\nPortugal\n\nCroatia\n\nSlovenia\n\nLuxembourg\n\nCyprus\n\nNew Zealand\n\nMalta\n\nGeorgia\n\nAlbania\n\nMontenegro\n\nMultilateral sanctions\n\nUnilateral sanctions\n\nNotes: The vertical lines o he righ and lef of he points represen a 95 percen confidence interval.

Simulations show ha \n\nChina's participation could heighten Russia's welfare loss by \n\napproximately 22 percent, while China itself would experi-\n\nence a negligible welfare loss (-0.02 percent). Furthermore, he \n\ninvolvemen of China appears o slightly reduce he welfare \n\nlosses experienced by other coalition members. This implies \n\ntha China's entry into he sanctions coalition could dramat-\n\nically bolster he coalition’s coercive power agains Russia.\n\nWhile hese simulations poin o he significan impac China \n\ncould have, i is politically unlikely ha China will join a sanc-\n\ntions coalition agains Russia. Given his, coalition members \n\nmus find alternative ways o strategically engage with China \n\nand other developing countries o limi Russia’s opportuni-\n\nties for circumventing sanctions. An importan step in his \n\ndirection is he EU's establishmen of a new International \n\nSpecial Envoy position in 2022, which is dedicated o facil-\n\nitating high-level dialogues with hird countries on sanc-\n\ntions enforcement.\n\nConclusion: Deeper coordination and stricter \n\nenforcemen required\n\nThis repor highlights he value of multilateral cooperation \n\nin imposing sanctions. In he case of 2014 sanctions agains \n\nRussia, such cooperation reduced welfare losses of he sanc-\n\ntioning states while increasing he welfare losses of he sanc-\n\ntioned state. Yet, here is a notable opportunity for deeper \n\ncoordination a he detailed produc level. For example, fewer \n\nthan 50 percen of he products sanctioned by he USA or \n\nthe EU agains Russia are jointly restricted by both.6 Thus, \n\nenhancing he overlap in sanctioned products can signifi-\n\ncantly curtail Russia's ability o circumven hese measures.\n\nAnother critical aspec of he 2014 sanctions was he uneven \n\neconomic burden shouldered by Eastern European coun-\n\ntries. This can have significan political ramifications for he \n\nEU and its ability o maintain a unified fron agains Russia. \n\nSince Russia's aggression owards Ukraine could persis over \n\nthe medium- o long-term, he EU mus engage more pro-\n\nactively in structured dialogue on potential burden-sharing \n\n6\t Ricardo Hausmann e al., “On he design of effective sanctions: The case of bans on exports o \n\nRussia,” CID Faculty Working Paper, no. 417 (2022) (available online).\n\nFigure 3\n\nHypothetical coalition partners and heir contribution o he punitive impac of sanctions agains Russia\n\nIn percentage points\n\n−0.32\n\n−0.1\n\n−0.01\n\n−0.001\n\n−0.0001 percentage points\n\nNotes: The map displays he additional welfare loss incurred by Russia from each new country joining he 2014 sanctions coalition.
