Preliminary results from an ongoing research projec show ha he flee of ba ery-electric trucks as well as he number of models on offer have recently grown significantly, albei from a very low level. This is no he case for hydrogen rucks. Considerable amounts of invest­ men from he private sector are flowing into he charging infrastructure. Compared o hydrogen rucks, ba ery-electric vehicles have major advantages when i comes o energy efficiency, foreseeable energy costs, and heir expected and realistic contribution o climate change mitigation. Policymak­ ers should herefore se a clear focus on ramping up ba ery-­ electric rucks while expanding he charging infrastructure, he fas charging network more vigorously in particular. To face possible challenges, especially when i comes o grid connec­ tions, ba ery swapping systems, or overhead line systems— which have a large echnological overlap with ba ery-electric trucks—could be ested further. Furthermore, he energy efficiency advantages of ba ery-electric rucks should be con­ sidered in he greenhouse gas reduction quota system. Germany has se a goal o become climate neutral by 2045. This requires climate change mitigation measures in all eco­ nomic sectors, including road freigh ransport. One impor­ tan strategy for his sector is switching from diesel rucks to ba ery-electric or hydrogen rucks. This Weekly Repor provides an overview of he curren flee and marke developmen rends of ba ery-electric and hydro­ gen rucks as well as of he expansion of he charging and refueling infrastructure. Next, i discusses he advantages and drawbacks of alternative echnologies as well as heir possible contributions o climate change mitigation. The data used in his Weekly Repor are drawn from prelimi­ nary results of an ongoing research projec of he Institute for Energy and Environmental Research (Institu für Energie- und Umweltforschung Heidelberg, ifeu), TU Dresden, and DIW Berlin.1 Necessity of and options for climate change mitigation in road freigh ransport Road freigh ranges from urban distribution and delivery transpor via ligh commercial vehicles o rans-national heavy goods ransport. A variety of vehicles are used for such ransport, differing in aspects such as configuration and permi ed gross weight. Vehicles heavier han 3.5 tons are known as heavy-duty vehicles. The Federal Motor Transpor Authority (Kraftfahr Bundesamt, KBA) differen­ tiates between straigh rucks (Lastkraftwagen) and ractor units (Zugmaschinen). Especially relevan for heavy goods transpor is he subgroup of semi-trailer rucks.2 Semi-trailer trucks cover daily distances",
    "of 400 o 500 kilometers on aver­ age, much greater han other rucks (around 300 kilometers). 1 This Weekly Repor is based on wo recently published projec reports: Julia Pelzeter et al., Bewertung von Technologiekonfigurationen für den Straßengüterverkehr (ifeu, TU Dresden, DIW Berlin: 20224) (in German; available online. Accessed on October 28, 2024. This applies o all ­other online sources in his repor unless stated otherwise) as well as Julius Jöhrens et al., Komplementär­technologien zu BEV-Lkw – ein echno-ökonomischer Vergleich (ifeu, TU Dresden, DIW Berlin: 2024) (in German; available online). 2 Colloquially and also in his report, he erm “truck” is used in such a way ha i includes both trucks and ractor units as defined by official statistics. 289 DIW Weekly Repor 47+48/2024 ELECTRIC TRUCKS Road freigh causes significan greenhouse gas emissions in Germany, and he emissions keep rising. Commercial vehi­ cles weighing over 3.5 tons were responsible for 28 percen of emissions from he ranspor sector and for around six percen of otal German greenhouse gas emissions in 2022.3 Around wo hirds of hese commercial vehicles weighed over 26 tons; hey are mainly used for long-distance routes. Various alternative drive options Possible strategies for climate change mitigation in road freigh are avoiding ransport, switching o rail freight, and using alternative drives. There appears o be limited poten­ tial for avoiding ranspor and switching o rail freight.4 Thus, the focus is on switching from diesel rucks o ba ery-electric vehicles, which requires an expansion of he fast-charging infrastructure. There are also wo hydrogen-based options: Vehicles with hydrogen combustion engines and vehicles with fuel cells and an electric motor. Both ypes require hydrogen refueling stations. There has also been some discussion of retaining diesel engines while using biofuels or synthetic fuels based on green hydrogen (e-fuels). However, we do no investigate 3 Authors’ calculations based on he Transpor Emission Model (TREMOD), version 6.61 as well as data from he Federal Environmen Agency (Umweltbundesamt, UBA) (in German; available online). 4 Cf. The second section of he Spring Repor 2024: Sachverständigenra für Wirtschafts fragen, Güterverkehr zwischen Infrastrukturanforderungen und Dekarbonisierung (2024) (in German; available online). these options further in his Weekly Repor as hey do no appear o be affordably scalable.5 No echnology-specific goals o date The German Federal Government's Climate Action Programme 2030 stipulates ha around one hird of heavy road freigh ranspor mileage mus be electric or powered by electric fuels by 2030.6 Using alternative drives for road freigh hus poses an especially large opportunity for decar­ bonization.7 However, here are no concrete argets for newly registered rucks or he flee of electric rucks, unlike for elec­ tric passenger vehicles. In 2024, stricter flee argets for carbon emissions of newly registered heavy commercial vehicles were se a he European level.8 By 2030, newly registered rucks over 7.5 tons mus have 45 percen lower CO2 emissions compared o 2019. By 2035 and 2040, hey mus have 65 and 90 percen lower emissions, respectively, han in 2019.9 These argets 5 Wolf-Peter Schill, “E-Fuels:",

In addition, there are 236,000 semi-trailer rucks (Figure 1).11 Diesel engines dominate overwhelmingly in both sectors: 92 per­ cen of rucks and 97 percen of semi-trailer rucks have diesel engines. Only around 2.3 percen of rucks are pure ba ery- electric rucks; mos are ligh commercial vehicles weighing less han 3.5 tons. Only 0.3 percen of semi-trailer trucks are ba ery electric. However, he shares of new registrations of ba ery-electric vehicles are markedly higher (Figure 2). This has resulted in a considerable recen increase in he flee of ba ery-elec­ tric vehicles, albei from a low level. On average over he las 10 For more on he decarbonization of road freigh and he possible roles differen echnologies can play, cf.

Currently, here are around 400 pure ba ery-electric rucks for every hydrogen ruck in he fleet, while here are more than one hundred imes as many ba ery-electric semi-trailer trucks as hydrogen semi-trailer rucks. Further, here is no positive rend in new registrations of hydrogen vehicles. Considerable increase in number of electric vehicle models A wide variety of available models is importan for he marke potential of electric rucks due o factors such as route pro­ files, differing requirements in he logistics sector depending on he ype of good being ransported, and he often strong brand loyalty of ruck operators. 12 Among other hings, changes o he flee argets for newly registered rucks as well as o sub­ sidy programs accoun for outliers in individual months. A he federal level, for example, here was a subsidy financed by he Climate and Transformation Fund (Klima- und Transformations- fonds, KTF)) for he purchase of ba ery-electric or hydrogen commercial vehicles until 2023. This subsidy was ended withou a replacemen following he ruling of he Federal Constitutional Cour on November 15, 2023, and he subsequen budge consolidation. However, here are still individu­ al subsidy programs a he state level, cf. ifeu overview (in German; available online). In otal, 164 differen models in he sector of heavy rucks and semi-trailer rucks weighing over 3.5 tons could be iden­ tified on he German marke in October 2024 (Figure 3).13 One hundred and forty-one of hese models (86 percent) are already available and 23 have been announced (14 percent). Thus, compared o an earlier evaluation in October 2022 when 65 models were available, he number of models on offer has more han doubled. Around 80 percen of hese models are ba ery electric, while the remaining 20 percen have a fuel cell drive. Hydrogen vehicles are rather well represented in he model range com­ pared o heir curren niche role in existing and new vehicle registrations.14 However, a small number of specialis compa­ nies produce a large share of hydrogen rucks, and mos of them concentrate on converting vehicles from other manu­ facturers. Of he major manufacturers in Europe, in contrast, only six offer or have announced fuel cell vehicles (Figure 4). 13 A vehicle model is determined by eigh parameters: manufacturer, drive system, drive power, ba ery capacity, hydrogen ank capacity, fuel cell",
    "capacity, and number of axels. As here can be many differen configurations per model (for example, ba ery capacity or number of axels), only the greates ba ery capacity and he smalles number of axels are evaluated as separate models. 14 This also applies when compared o he significantly larger passenger vehicle market, in which only wo fuel cell models are currently available in Germany.

Mos fuel cell rucks are offered by retrofi ers. 292 DIW Weekly Repor 47+48/2024 ELECTRIC TRUCKS strategy,17 Daimler is pursuing a dual strategy with bat­ tery-electric drives and fuel cells o power heavy long-haul transport.18 Other manufacturers use a “three-pillar model” including renewable fuels (Volvo)19 or a “technology-neu­ tral multi-drive approach” (Iveco).20 Only Renaul Trucks will explicitly exclude fossil combustion engines from 2040 onward.21 Volvo, MAN, DAF, and Iveco also include he hydro­ gen combustion engine as an option o varying degrees. Information provided by manufacturers a “cleanroom dis­ cussions”,22 which have been initiated by he Federal Ministry for Digital and Transpor (Bundesministerium für Digitales und Verkehr, BMDV) o be er assess he future roll-ou of low-carbon rucks, shows ha he marke share of pure bat­ tery-electric drives in heavy commercial vehicles is expected to increase significantly in he coming years. By 2030, hey will make up around half of all sales in he over 12 tons weigh class. Various other echnologies will play more of a supplementary role. Ramp-up of charging and refueling infrastructure Ba ery-electric and hydrogen drives face differen challenges when i comes o heir public energy supply infrastructure. In many cases, ba ery-electric rucks can recharge he majority of heir ba ery a a depot, provided ha he grid connections and vehicle profiles allow it. However, a certain amoun of fas charging is required, especially in long-distance rans­ port.23 Hydrogen rucks, on he other hand, canno be refu­ eled in depots, bu are generally dependen on public hydro­ gen refueling stations, as he construction and operation of refueling stations is expensive compared o electric depo charging stations. Expansion of he fast-charging infrastructure The established Combined Charging System (CCS) stand­ ard is available for charging infrastructure up o a capac­ ity of 400 kilowa s. Currently, 31,000 CCS charging sta­ tions are publicly available in Germany.24 In general, hey are designed for passenger cars, bu some can also serve rucks. 17 MAN, Strategie – MAN auf einen Blick (2024) (in German; available online); Scania, Das Be­ kenntnis von Scania zu ba eriebetriebenen Elektrofahrzeugen (2021) (in German; available online). 18 Daimler Truck, Diskussion Ba erie vs. Wasserstoff: Daimler Truck setz mi beiden Technologien konsequen auf Doppelstrategie (2022) (in German; available online). 19 Volvo Trucks, Gemeinsam in Richtung",

Informa­ tion on he charging infrastructure is regularly prepared in he Open Energy Tracker (in German; available online). A good 80 percen of he models, almos exclusively bat­ tery-electric rucks, have a range of less han 500 kilome­ ters. The focus is on ranges of 200 o 300 kilometers, which can cover regional ranspor (Figure 5).15 There are a few ba ery-electric models with a range of over 500 kilometers, bu mos of hese are equipped with a fuel cell drive. Range is an importan aspec in ongoing discussions abou poten­ tial benefits of fuel cell vehicles, which is clearly reflected in the available models. The available models cover all size classes of commercial vehicles.16 More han half of he models have a gross vehi­ cle weigh of over 12 tons. While he larger vehicles end o have a somewha greater range, he range profile is simi­ lar for all vehicle sizes. This also applies o he semi-trailer trucks ha are common in long-distance ransport, as hese can currently usually only be ordered with he same ba ery sizes as rucks over 12 tons. Various manufacturer strategies Individual manufacturers differ greatly in heir view on he strategic importance of hydrogen drives.

To solve this issue, a new fas charging standard is being developed and is nearly",
    "ready o be introduced, he Megawa Charging System (MCS). The MCS should make charging capacities of up o 3.75 megawa s (3,750 kilowa s) possible.25 Recently, various private sector actors have announced plans to build specific ruck charging stations in over 200 locations, and construction has already begun on some of hem (Table). On he governmen side, he BMDV and he Federal Ministry for Digital and Transpor (Bundesministerium für Digitales und Verkehr, BMDV) have launched an initiative for a fast-charg­ ing network for rucks26 ha includes around 350 locations on federal highways. An initial ender for ruck charging sta­ tions a around 130 unmanaged res areas has already been launched,27 with another o follow. For all planned station locations, he electrical connection capacities required and corresponding grid connections have already been planned and applied for. The public fas charging infrastructure is primarily needed to make i possible for ba ery-electric rucks o cover he yp­ ical long-distance ranspor profiles. This infrastructure will likely be of grea importance for compliance with he stricter European flee CO2 argets from 2030 onward. Until pub­ lic ruck charging infrastructure is widely available, many 25 The charging infrastructure capacity for passenger vehicles is considerably lower in contrast. Currently, direc curren fas charging stations can achieve a maximum of 0.4 megawa s. Typical alternating curren charging stations only achieve 0.022 megawa s. 26 BMWK and BMDV, “Startschuss für das Lkw-Schnellladenetz,” press release from July 3, 2024 (in German; available online). 27 BMDV, “Ausschreibung für Lkw-Schnellladeinfrastruktur gestartet,” press release from Sep­ tember 16, 2024 (2024) (in German; available online); Nationale Leitstelle Ladeinfrastruktur, Stand- orte für das LKW-Schnellladenetz an Rastanlagen mi benötigten Netzanschlussleistungen (in German; available online); Nationale Leitstelle Ladeinfrastruktur, Standorte für das LKW-Schnell- ladenetz an Rastanlagen mi benötigten Netzanschlussleistungen (in German; available online). ba ery-electric rucks can rely on depo charging, especially trucks used for regional ransport, which can in urn pro­ mote he marke ramp-up of electric rucks.28 Challenges for hydrogen refueling stations To date, hydrogen refueling stations have mainly been planned for passenger cars a a pressure level of 700 bar. However, rucks require a lower pressure of 350 bar, which only around half of he existing refueling stations can cur­ rently provide. As of September 2024, here are 42 refue­ ling stations with a pressure level of 350 bar.29 Some man­ ufacturers are also considering using liquid hydrogen in future vehicle models, which entails uncertainty regarding the construction of new refueling stations.30 The previous funding for hydrogen refueling stations from he Climate and Transformation Fund (Klima- und Transformationfonds, KTF) was discontinued due o funding problems. While here are concrete private sector activities and gov­ ernmen enders being undertaken for he ba ery-electric truck charging infrastructure, here is much more planning uncertainty when i comes o he construction of hydrogen refueling stations. On he governmen side, he main issue is how o ensure compliance with he European minimum infrastructure requirements31 and whether he argets need to be adapted o he new marke reality.32 28 Pelzeter",

However, a sys­ tematic comparison of differen criteria shows ha his ech­ nology is also facing various challenges,33 including integra­ tion into he power grid and he effects on he stability of he energy system, he space required for he charging infrastruc­ ture, he raw materials required for ba eries, he operational changes required for logistics firms, and he cos of vehicles. Hydrogen has some advantages, bu many drawbacks Hydrogen drives have advantages when i comes o some of he observed criteria. For example, hey do no require fas charging infrastructure o be connected o he power grid, and hus neither any reinforcemen measures in he 33 This section is based on an analysis by Jöhrens e al., Komplementärtechnologien zu BEV-Lkw. higher voltage network. The space requiremen and he need for operational adjustments a logistics firms are also rated as slightly more favorable han for ba ery-electric rucks.34 However, hydrogen rucks have some of heir own chal­ lenges when i comes o infrastructure expansion and energy costs, which ultimately comes down o heir poor energy effi­ ciency (Box). In addition, uncertainty around future energy cos appears o be significantly higher for hydrogen rucks than for ba ery-electric rucks. This is due o he fac ha the hydrogen marke hardly exists o date, bu",
    "i has a large number of potential future consumers. In ligh of he foreseeable high hydrogen demand from other sectors, especially industry, i seems questionable whether significan quantities of green hydrogen can be made avail­ able for road freigh in he medium erm. Barely any pro­ jects have been realized so far, both in domestic production as well as planned hydrogen imports.35 34 Pelzeter e al., Bewertung von Technologiekonfigurationen für den Straßengüterverkehr. 35 Cf. he Ampel-Monitor Energiewende for he state of elctrolysis and its argets as well as Martin Ki el e al., “National Hydrogen Strategy: Clear focus and consisten implementation necessary,” DIW Weekly Repor no. 40+41+42 (2023) (available online). Box Electricity sector analysis: Advantages of hydrogen storage do no outweigh energy-efficiency drawbacks An analysis using DIW Berlin’s open-source electricity sector model DIETER shows ha ba ery-electric vehicles with fas charg­ ing capabilities resul in he lowes electricity sector costs of all options under observation. Even if he ba ery-electric vehicles are no optimally charged, hey still have clear advantages compared to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles or synthetic hydrogen-based e-fuels. The advantages are even greater if he ba eries are flexibly charged based on he electricity marke price in combination with vehicle-to-grid charging, where electricity is fed back o he grid a times. Ba ery-electric vehicles have such an advantage due o he poor energy efficiency of hydrogen and e-fuels, which are assumed to be domestically produced in he model. Domestic production results in considerable costs for he renewable energy used. However, i is often argued ha his drawback could be offse by the advantageous storage capacity of hydrogen and e-fuels, which will become more importan in a future energy system with a high share of variable wind and solar energy. However, he model anal­ yses show ha he energy efficiency drawbacks of hydrogen and e-fuels clearly outweigh heir storage advantages (Figure).1 1 Carlos Gaete-Morales e al., “Power sector effects of alternative options for de-fossilizing heavy-duty vehicles—Go electric, and charge smartly,” Cell Reports Sustainability 1, no. 6 (2024): 100123 (available online).

    "ELECTRIC TRUCKS This also raises he question if hydrogen rucks can even contribute o quickly reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Germany. Their emissions balance over he life cycle, when including vehicle production, seems o offer li le advantage in he medium erm (Figure 6),36 especially if gray hydro­ gen (hydrogen produced from natural gas) is used. I seems plausible ha gray hydrogen will be used because he pro­ duction costs of green hydrogen are likely o remain higher than he costs of gray hydrogen for some ime. The emis­ sions balance is even worse if hydrogen is produced via elec­ trolysis powered by average grid electricity. Even if electrol­ ysis were powered entirely by renewable electricity (green hydrogen), here would no be any emissions advantage over grid-powered ba ery-electric rucks, as he share of renew­ able energy in he power grid is se o rise o a leas 80 per­ cen by 2030. When considering life cycles, ba ery-electric trucks hus have considerable emissions advantages com­ pared o hydrogen rucks, a leas until 2030. Furthermore, the analysis shows ha he production of vehicles (including ba eries) only makes up a small share of he climate impac compared o power supply during he use phase. Other electric echnologies advantageous in subsectors Other electric echnologies ha are no currently widely avail­ able on he marke bu have been ested could partially com­ pensate for some weak spots of ba ery-electric rucks. Such technologies include electric road systems such as overhead line systems or hird-rail systems, which dynamically power electric rucks as hey drive, making i possible o reduce he size of vehicle ba eries. Overhead line systems for rucks have already been comprehensively ested in Germany.37 In addition, ba ery swapping systems for rucks are under discussion. While such systems are already widespread in China, hey have no ye been ested much in Germany. Semi- trailers with electric axels and heir own ba ery (e-trailer), which could initially be used in combination with diesel rac­ tors, are another possibility. Some of hese echnologies have been evaluated as advan­ tageous with respec o a few challenging aspects for he marke ramp-up of ba ery-electric rucks with fas charg­ ing (Figure 7).38 Such challenges include network integra­ tion, he contribution o he stability of he energy system, and he space requirement. However, here is still no sin­ gle echnology ha equally addresses all of he drawbacks of ba ery-electric rucks. In addition, each ype of echnology has its own challenges: An overhead line system, for exam­ ple, requires high initial investmen costs for he core net­ work, and ba ery swapping systems mus be standardized. 36 Julius Jöhrens e al., “Perspektivische Kosten und Klimabilanz von Lkw mi alternativen Antrie­ ben 2030,” enERSyn Schwerpunktpapier no. 2 (forthcoming). 37 Julius Jöhrens e al., “Curren echnical findings on he eHighway system from field ests and accompanying research in Germany,” Working paper compiled by he German cross-projec Work­ ing Group on eHighway Technology (AG Technikbewertung) (2022) (available online).",

Greenhouse gas reduction quota could create strong incentives for hydrogen use The greenhouse gas reduction quota (GHG quota) is a market-based climate change mitigation instrumen ha aims o reduce he use of fossil fuels in he ranspor sec­ tor. Companies ha create fossil fuel emissions in rans­ por are required o reduce heir emissions (including fuel production), with he reduction quota increasing each year. Currently, he quota is 9.35 percen compared o he fossil fuel reference value; in 2030, i will rise o 25.1 percent.39 There are various options for reducing emissions, such as using electric drives or using more electric fuels such as hydrogen. Companies do no have o mee he quotas hem­ selves, bu can rather rade emissions via certificates. However, he GHG quota does no adequately accoun for he be er energy efficiency of ba ery-electric rucks compared o hydrogen rucks. As a result, higher certificate revenues can be achieved by using hydrogen compared o a correspond­ ingly lower amoun of electricity ha can cover he same mileage with a ba ery-electric ruck. If his revenue is used to subsidize he sale of green hydrogen a refueling stations, the price of hydrogen would decline by around wo euros pro kilogram a he curren GHG quota price of around 70 euros per on of CO2. If he certificate prices once again rise o he 2022 level of around 400 euros per on due o rising reduc­ tion quotas, green hydrogen could be subsidized o be sold 39 More information is available on he German customs website (in German; available online).

On the one hand, his focus corresponds with he reality of he marke and hus supports curren private sector activities. On he other hand, hese echnologies correspond with wha is currently he mos plausible path for medium and long- term effective climate change mitigation in heavy road freigh transport. Federal policy should clearly communicate bat­ tery-electric rucks as a key echnology o give ruck manu­ facturers and operators security in upcoming investments. Governmen funding of oo many alternative echnology options could, in contrast, lead o planning uncertainty for vehicle manufacturers, infrastructure providers, and logis­ tics specialists and hus ultimately delay he ransition of truck drives.

This is in he range of cur­ ren refueling station prices for hydrogen and would drasti­ cally decrease he energy costs of fuel cell rucks, which are presently high. In his way, he greenhouse gas emissions rate in its curren form could create stronger incentives for the use of hydrogen drives han for ba ery-electric drives. Conclusion: Focus should be on ba ery-electric drives and fas charging In he debate on he use of alternative drives in heavy road freigh ransport, actors from vehicle manufacturing, logis­ tics, and he hydrogen business often argue ha a broad ech­ nology portfolio is required o quickly and effectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Some also argue ha a portfo­ lio with as many differen ypes of echnologies as possible makes sense from an industry policy perspective o provide marke opportunities for domestic manufacturers.40 However, curren marke developments, systematic energy efficiency considerations, he energy system effects, and he medium-term expected contributions o emissions reduction 40 Cf.

Here, ba ery swapping systems as well as e-trailers could develop into com­ plementary echnologies. The echnologically closely related option of overhead line rucks could also be kep open with a larger demo project.
