A \n\nsharp rise in construction investment, albeit more of a flash \n\nin the pan as a result of mild winter weather, along with \n\nstrong goods exports helped the economy onto its recov­\n\nery path and masked the disappointing development of \n\nprivate consumption, which sank unexpectedly. However, \n\nconsumer sentiment has since brightened considerably: \n\nFollowing the recent special payments, employees in many \n\nsectors are now earning more on a permanent basis due \n\nto pay raises, which increases income security. In conjunc­\n\ntion with the inflation rate now being stable at below the \n\nthree-percent threshold, real wages are rising significantly. \n\nAdded to this is the turnaround in interest rates initiated \n\nby the European Central Bank, which is making saving less \n\nattractive and loans more affordable. The UEFA European \n\nMen’s Football Championship, which is being held in Ger­\n\nmany this year, is also likely to boost consumption, albeit \n\nslightly.\n\nIn addition to private consumption, foreign trade will prove \n\nto be the second mainstay of the German economy in the \n\nforecast period. On the one hand, imports are increasing \n\nas the domestic economy becomes stronger. On the other \n\nhand, the German export industry will also experience a \n\nsignificant boost, as industrial production is likely to pick up \n\nworldwide. Due to the high share of intermediate products \n\nand investment goods, exports “made in Germany” are \n\nparticularly dependent on the global industry’s economic \n\nsituation. In Germany, too, industrial companies will begin \n\ninvesting more in their capacities from 2025 at the latest. \n\nConstruction investment will then also rise again.\n\nOverall, the outlook is somewhat more positive than it was \n\nin the spring: Instead of stagnating, DIW Berlin now expects \n\nthe German economy to grow by 0.3 percent in 2024 and \n\nby 1.3 percent in 2025. One risk factor for the forecast \n\nis that the full extent of the damage from the flooding in \n\nsouthern Germany is still unclear. In some places, pro­\n\nduction capacities could remain impaired for longer than \n\nexpected. At the same time, it is also conceivable that \n\nrepair and reconstruction work could increase economic \n\noutput. Overall, however, the effects in one way or the other \n\nare likely to remain manageable. In addition, the tug-of-war \n\nover the next federal budget could once again become a \n\nfactor contributing to uncertainty, possibly even more so \n\nthan was already to be expected after the results of the EU \n\nelections in Germany.\n\nThe global economy will also gain some momentum over \n\nthe forecast period. The euro area is finally overcoming its \n\nweak phase for good and international trade is picking up \n\nspeed. The interest rate turnaround in the major advanced \n\neconomies will likely have a positive effect on residential \n\nconstruction and corporate investments from the second \n\nhalf of 2024. Overall, the global economy is expected to \n\ngrow by 3.7 percent in 2024 and by 3.6 percent in 2025.\n\n169\n\nDIW Weekly Report 24+25+26/2024\n\nGLOBAL ECONOMY\n\nThe global economy developed better than expected in the \n\nfirst quarter of 2024 in particular due to the recovery of \n\ndomestic demand in most advanced economies. Among \n\nthe emerging economies, China performed surprisingly \n\nwell in terms of high exports and strong industrial output.\n\nIn Europe, real wage increases have finally arrived in the \n\npockets of consumers and are boosting private consumption. \n\nQuarter-on-quarter the economy expanded by 0.3 and 0.6 per­\n\ncent in the euro area and the United Kingdom, respectively. \n\nEconomic growth in the United States was at 0.3 percent and \n\ncontinues to be carried by consumer spending. In contrast, \n\ninflation is weighing strongly on domestic demand in Japan, \n\nwhere GDP shrunk by 0.5 percent in the first quarter of 2024. \n\nOf the emerging economies, the Indian and Chinese econ­\n\nomies experienced the most growth. The Chinese economy \n\nexpanded by 1.6 percent, more than in the previous quarter; \n\nthis was driven primarily by industrial output and exports, \n\nwhile domestic demand continued to develop weakly. Overall, \n\nthe global economy expanded by 1.0 percent in the first quar­\n\nter of 2024, similar to the fourth quarter of 2023 (Figure 1).\n\nThe global economy should continue its recovery into the \n\ncurrent second quarter of 2024. The upswing in the advanced \n\neconomies will receive a bit more momentum, especially due \n\nto the euro area economy, where falling inflation rates com­\n\nbined with rising nominal wages are leading to rising real \n\nwages. This should boost the purchasing power of consum­\n\ners as well as domestic demand. The upswing in the United \n\nKingdom is also likely to continue; the favorable outlook for \n\nservices points to a further increase in consumption. The \n\nUS economy, in contrast, is expected to expand only mod­\n\nerately, as private households’ remaining excess savings are \n\nrunning out, cooling private consumption. In Japan, high \n\ninflation is continuing to weigh on economic growth. The \n\nManufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Indices have been \n\nrecovering in most advanced economies since the beginning \n\nof 2024. The May values for Japan, the United Kingdom, and \n\nthe United States are consistently over the threshold expan­\n\nsion of 50. The value for the euro area remained under 50, \n\nbut experienced a strong increase from 45.7 in April to 47.3 \n\nin May. Thus, industrial output is likely to gradually pick \n\nup speed.\n\nThe emerging economies are expected to cool down in the \n\nsecond quarter following a strong first quarter. While eco­\n\nnomic development in China and India continues to support \n\ngrowth, other countries such as Brazil and Mexico are experi­\n\nencing weak growth due to dampened domestic demand. In \n\ncontrast, there are signs of a recovery in economic momen­\n\ntum in China, mainly due to more expansive monetary and \n\nfiscal policies. Moreover, the recovery of the global econ­\n\nomy is likely to boost Chinese exports. Continued dynamic \n\ngrowth is expected for the Indian economy in the second \n\nquarter thanks to solid domestic demand.\n\nInternational trade recovered by 0.3 percent in the first quar­\n\nter of 2024, following a decline of 1.9 percent in 2023. Weak \n\ndemand from advanced economies and ongoing geopolitical \n\nturmoil weighed on international trade in 2023. Nevertheless, \n\nsome trade barriers have partly been dissolved since the \n\nbeginning of the year: For example, circumventing blockaded \n\ntrade routes from Asia to Europe by means of an alternative \n\nAfrican route is now factored into supply chains and produc­\n\ntion. This and the gradual recovery of the global economy \n\nare likely to lead to international trade picking up somewhat \n\nin 2024, albeit less strongly than before the pandemic. One \n\nimportant reason for this is that trade policy conflicts, espe­\n\ncially between Western countries and China, will continue \n\nto have a dampening effect. The punitive tariffs imposed by \n\nthe US government on Chinese electric vehicles and sem­\n\niconductors in May 2024 emphasize the fact that the situa­\n\ntion is not expected to ease anytime soon.\n\nMonetary policy in many advanced economies remained \n\nrestrictive at the beginning of 2024 and interest rates were \n\nstill high. The first key interest rate cuts were made in spring \n\nGlobal economy: Advanced economies once again \n\npicking up speed\n\nFigure 1\n\nGrowth of real GDP\n\nQuarter-on-quarter percentage growth (left axis); index 2015 \n\nQ1 = 100 (right axis)\n\n \n\nSources: National Statistical Offices; DIW Berlin Economic Outlook Summer 2024.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nThe advanced economies are contributing somewhat more to economic growth again. \n\n170\n\nDIW Weekly Report 24+25+26/2024\n\nGLOBAL ECONOMY\n\n2024 in light of lower inflation rates only in isolated cases, \n\nsuch as in Switzerland. It is expected that other central banks \n\nwill begin lowering their interest rates in the summer (Box). \n\nIn the euro area, this turnaround happened on June 6th, \n\nsooner than in the United States and the United Kingdom \n\ndue to rapidly falling inflation rates. Commodity prices are \n\nalso no longer likely to provide any price-driving impetus. \n\nJapan is a special case, as its inflation is still well above the \n\nBank of Japan’s two-percent target as of April 2024 at 2.5 per­\n\ncent, which is unusually high for the country.\n\nMonetary policy has once again become somewhat less \n\nrestrictive in many emerging economies. There have already \n\nbeen regular key interest rate cuts in Brazil since the end \n\nof 2023 due to declining inflation rates and low economic \n\ngrowth, while Mexico decreased its key interest rates in \n\nMarch 2024. In February 2024, the People’s Bank of China \n\nalso adopted a more expansive course by lowering its mini­\n\nmum reserves to support the struggling economy and com­\n\nbat deflationary trends. In India, the key interest rate will \n\nlikely not be lowered until the third quarter because food \n\nBox\n\nAssumptions and framework conditions\n\nThe forecast is based on the following assumptions about the \n\nfurther development of key interest rates, exchange rates, and \n\ncommodity prices (Table). These assumptions were made based \n\non previous development, futures markets prices, and the closing \n\nprices on the date of this forecast (14. May 2024).\n\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) first decreased interest rates in \n\nJune, as was assumed in the spring forecast. After a year of stable \n\ninterest rates, it has now initiated a turnaround; further interest \n\nrate cuts will follow. We assume five subsequent cuts over the \n\nforecasting horizon. In detail, we assume a cut of 35 basis points \n\nat the September 2024 meeting, and subsequent cuts every \n\nquarter of respectively 25 basis points.1 Taken together, this leads \n\nto a  decline of 85 basis points in 2024 and of 75 basis points in \n\n2025. The ECB has thus initiated an interest rate cut before the \n\nUS Federal Reserve. The Fed and the Bank of England will presum­\n\nably not lower interest rates until the third quarter of 2024.\n\nMoney market interest rates fell at the beginning of 2024 in antici-\n\npation of the interest rate turnaround. It is assumed that these, in \n\nline with key interest rates, will continue to fall over the forecast \n\nhorizon. The refinancing costs for households and companies are \n\n1 \n\nFurthermore, the ECB is expected to reduce the corridor between the deposit facility rate and \n\nthe main refinancing rate to 15 basis points from September 18, 2024.\n\nlikely to decline as key interest rates fall over the next years. The \n\nreturn on government bonds slightly increased again following a \n\nbrief decline in winter 2023. It is assumed that capital market inter­\n\nest rates will remain largely unchanged over the forecast horizon \n\nat 2.6 percent for Germany and 3.1 percent for the euro area. The \n\neuro has recently depreciated against the US dollar due to the \n\ninterest rate differential. For the forecast period, it is assumed that \n\nthe exchange rate of EUR to USD will remain at 1,08 USD per EUR, \n\nthe level reached at the end of the data period on June 6.\n\nUncertainties about the gas supply in the coming year resulted \n\nin slight increases in the wholesale price for gas (TTF) recently. \n\nHowever, well-filled gas storage facilities should prevent a severe \n\nsupply shortage. According to futures, the average gas price \n\nshould be around 30.90 and 35.50 euros per megawatt hours in \n\n2024 and 2025, respectively. According to traded futures, the price \n\nfor Brent oil should increase slightly in the coming months before \n\ndeclining again at the start of 2025 until the end of the forecast \n\nperiod. In 2024, the average price is likely to be 83 USD per barrel \n\nbefore it declines to an average of 78 USD per barrel in 2025.\n\nThis forecast is also based on political assumptions: We assume \n\nthat no further escalations will occur, but also that none of the cur­\n\nrent geopolitical crises, such as the Israeli-Hamas war, the Russo-\n\nUkrainian War, and conflict between China and Taiwan, will end.\n\nTable\n\nForecast assumptions\n\n \n\n \n\n2022\n\n2023\n\n2024\n\n2025\n\nECB key interest rate (year end)\n\nPercent\n\n2.5\n\n4.5\n\n3.7\n\n2.9\n\nMoney market interest rate\n\nThree-month EURIBOR in percent\n\n0.3\n\n3.4\n\n3.6\n\n2.9\n\nCapital market interest\n\nYield on euro-area government bonds with a remaining term of ten years \n\n2.3\n\n3.2\n\n3.0\n\n3.1\n\nCapital market interest\n\nYield on German government bonds with a remaining term of ten years \n\n1.8\n\n2.5\n\n2.6\n\n2.6\n\nExchange rate\n\nUSD/EUR\n\n1.05\n\n1.09\n\n1.08\n\n1.08\n\nCrude oil price\n\nUSD per barrel \n\n98.6\n\n82.1\n\n83.0\n\n78.0\n\nGas price\n\nEUR per megawatt hour\n\n133.9\n\n42.2\n\n30.9\n\n35.5\n\nNote: Annual average unless indicated otherwise.

On the one hand, this is due to \n\nthe fact that measures taken to combat the energy crisis are \n\nexpiring. On the other hand, higher interest rates are putting \n\ngovernments under pressure to reduce expenditure, which is \n\nlikely to be to the detriment of medium-term investment pro­\n\ngrams. In the EU, however, the NextGenerationEU recovery \n\nfunding is stimulating investments in Member States, while \n\nthe new European fiscal rules are creating leeway for invest­\n\nments that support growth.1 China is again an exception here: \n\n1 \n\nEuropean Parliament, “New EU fiscal rules approved by MEPs,” press release from April 23, \n\n2024 (available online; accessed on May 30, 2024. This applies to all other online sources in this \n\n report unless stated otherwise).\n\nThe Chinese government announced several billion-euro \n\nmeasures to revive the debt-ridden real estate sector.\n\nThe global economy is likely to continue gaining momentum \n\nthroughout the further course of the forecast. The interest \n\nrate turnaround in the major advanced economies will likely \n\nhave a positive effect on residential construction and corpo­\n\nrate investments from the second half of 2024 and primar­\n\nily in 2025. Private consumption is also likely to support the \n\nupswing in the advanced economies, which is partly due to \n\nthe continued good situation on the labor market and accord­\n\ningly solid growth in labor income. The output gap in the \n\nUnited States is likely to close over the course of the forecast \n\nhorizon, as is the currently negative output gap in the euro \n\narea. Chinese GDP is likely to continue its powerful devel­\n\nopment, but rates are likely to be lower than before the pan­\n\ndemic.

Local governments in China are also heavily over­\n\nindebted due to the ongoing real estate crisis. The fact that \n\n2024 is a record election year could also lead to a further \n\nincrease in debt ratios. Forty-nine percent of the world popu­\n\nlation will be going to the polls in 2024. Elections often entail \n\nfiscal stimuli and thus higher debt.2 Together with higher \n\ninterest rates, this could signal a somewhat more restrictive \n\nfiscal policy in the future.\n\nIn addition, the elections are creating a greater risk of political \n\npolarization in many countries. For example, uncertainties \n\nregarding the direction of US economic and security policy \n\nwould increase if Donald Trump is re-elected in November. \n\nA further escalation of the trade conflict with China is also \n\nto be expected under a Trump administration. Moreover, it \n\nis not yet clear to what extent the nationalist forces in the \n\nEU Parliament, which made strong gains in the recent elec­\n\ntions, will paralyze the EU’s active role in shaping common \n\neconomic and foreign policy.\n\n2 Cf. International Monetary Fund, “Fiscal Policy in the Great Election Year,” Fiscal Monitor \n\n(April 2024) (available online).\n\npast decades in light of demographic development and the \n\nprovinces’ high level of debt.\n\nOn average, the advanced economies should expand by \n\n1.7 percent in 2024. Economic output will likely increase by \n\n4.9 percent in the emerging economies. Overall, the global \n\neconomy is expected to grow by 3.7 percent in 2024 (Table 1). \n\nAs the development in the euro area as well as in China was \n\nbetter than expected in the first half of 2024, DIW Berlin is \n\nincreasing its forecast for the entire year by 0.2 percentage \n\npoints. In 2025, the global economy is likely to increase by \n\n3.6 percent, unchanged from the spring forecast.\n\nThis forecast is based on several uncertainty factors. On \n\nthe one hand, geopolitical risks remain quite high. The cri­\n\nses relating to the ongoing Israel-Hamas War could spread \n\nthroughout the region; there is also no end to the Russo-\n\nUkrainian War in sight. There are also simmering geopo­\n\nlitical conflicts in Asia concerning the Korean peninsula or \n\nTaiwan, for example. A possible intensification of these geo­\n\npolitical conflicts harbors many risks for the global economy, \n\nfrom temporarily higher energy and resource prices to major \n\ntrade distortions and real economic losses.\n\nA further risk factor is public debt sustainability in light of \n\nhigher interest rates. Long-term government bond yields \n\n173\n\nDIW Weekly Report 24+25+26/2024\n\nGERMAN ECONOMY\n\nweak period caused by the sharp rise in energy prices. \n\nNevertheless, they are not likely to recover all losses in the \n\nlong term. At least some of the energy-intensive companies \n\nhave relocated production abroad by now and cut jobs in \n\nGermany in light of the country’s comparatively high energy \n\ncosts. Together with the strong expansion in the construction \n\nindustry, industrial production was also able to increase over­\n\nall and contribute positively to gross value added with nearly \n\n0.1 percentage points. However, the overall increase was pri­\n\nmarily carried by services; both the consumer-related (around \n\n0.1 percentage points) as well as public (around 0.2 percent­\n\nage points) service sectors experienced a strong expansion.\n\nIn the current second quarter, the German economy is likely \n\nto increase again by 0.2 percent (Table 2). Private consumption \n\nin particular should improve on a sustained basis. Households \n\nare slowly gaining purchasing power due to continuously ris­\n\ning real wages. Following the one-time special payments that \n\nwere paid to employees in many sectors in 2023, the collec­\n\ntive wage increases are now in effect in many places, which \n\nresults in employees permanently earning more money. This \n\nis likely to strengthen income security. The strong growth in \n\nreal wages is a relief to low-income households in particular, \n\nThe German economy is slowly exiting its slump, starting out \n\n2024 with momentum following weak performance in 2023.3 \n\nEconomic output increased by 0.2 percent in the first quar­\n\nter of 2024, more than previously expected (Figure 2).4 The \n\nrobust growth rate in the first quarter was due in particular \n\nto a surprisingly strong increase in construction investment \n\nas a result of mild winter weather. In addition, goods exports \n\nrose unexpectedly sharply, resulting in a positive trade bal­\n\nance. Meanwhile, private consumption continued to decline \n\ndespite falling inflation rates and rising disposable incomes.\n\nHigh interest rates and the German government’s polit­\n\nical indecisiveness seemed to have dampened consumer \n\nsentiment at the beginning of 2024. Even strong growth in \n\nreal wages seemingly could not boost consumer confidence \n\nenough at the beginning of the year to prevent a decline in \n\nprivate consumption. The signs for a recovery in private con­\n\nsumption were there at the beginning of 2024: Employment \n\nincreased and nominal wages rose significantly, for example \n\nin the energy industry and in the public sector at the state \n\nlevel. Together with further declining consumer price infla­\n\ntion, which has been consistently below the three-percent \n\nthreshold, real wages rose noticeably. The decline in infla­\n\ntion is primarily due to lower food inflation and lower energy \n\ngoods prices. Meanwhile, core inflation, which excludes food­\n\nstuffs and energy, rose more strongly in the first quarter, \n\nwhich was likely largely due to rising prices for services.\n\nGoods exports increased markedly, especially the export of \n\nchemical and pharmaceutical products. Chemical products \n\noften serve as the intermediate inputs in further production \n\nprocesses. After their marked declined due to high energy \n\nprices, their recent increase might point to a gradual recov­\n\nery of global industrial production. German goods imports \n\nalso increased strongly. However, as imports grew less over­\n\nall than exports, there was a positive trade balance in the first \n\nquarter. Private and public investments also supported eco­\n\nnomic output. The main reason for this was the mild weather, \n\nwhich boosted production in the construction industry and \n\nled to a significant increase in construction investment, par­\n\nticularly in residential construction. In contrast, equipment \n\ninvestment declined slightly.\n\nGross value added rose somewhat more strongly in the first \n\nquarter at 0.3 percent than GDP. Production in the manu­\n\nfacturing industry rose slightly. Energy-intensive sectors are \n\nshowing signs of a slow recovery and were able to expand \n\nproduction again for the first time following the prolonged \n\n3 According to revised data from the Federal Statistical Office, the decline in economic output in \n\nthe fourth quarter of 2023 was somewhat more pronounced than had been reported in the spring.\n\n4 This forecast uses price-adjusted figures except for when describing price and wage develop­\n\nments, public finances, and public debt.\n\nGerman economy: Private consumption becoming \n\nthe driver of the upturn\n\nFigure 2\n\nReal GDP growth in Germany\n\nIn billions of euros (left axis) and quarter-on-quarter in percent \n\n(right axis)\n\n \n\nNote: Forecast from the second quarter of 2024 onwards; price, seasonally, and calendar adjusted.\n\nSources: National Statistical Offices; DIW Berlin Economic Outlook Summer 2024.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nThe German economy will grow again in both 2024 and 2025.\n\n174\n\nDIW Weekly Report 24+25+26/2024\n\nGERMAN ECONOMY\n\nwho are henceforth likely to support consumption. Household \n\nsurveys also indicate a lower propensity to save and a greater \n\nwillingness to consume. The UEFA European Men’s Football \n\nChampionship, which is taking place in Germany in early \n\nsummer, will provide additional momentum for private con­\n\nsumption in the second and third quarters.\n\nThe global economy is boosting foreign demand. German \n\nforeign trade is likely to benefit in particular from the upturn \n\nexperienced by important euro area trade partners. Imports \n\nare likely to increase at a similar rate to exports, meaning that \n\nthe overall contribution of foreign trade to GDP in the sec­\n\nond quarter will probably be lower than in the first quarter.\n\nFollowing the strong start to the year, investments, however, \n\nare unlikely to provide any growth stimuli in the current sec­\n\nond quarter. A negative countermove to the strong increase \n\nin the first quarter is expected in construction investment, \n\nmainly due to a decline in residential construction, where \n\nthe situation remains extremely tense. Equipment invest­\n\nment is also likely to fall again slightly in light of the still \n\nfragile economic situation.\n\nIndustry is also likely to recover rather slowly. Companies \n\nare continuing to view their situation cautiously. The manu­\n\nfacturing industry has been recording fewer and fewer new \n\norders since 2022 and business expectations are improving \n\nonly slowly. The Global Composite Purchasing Managers’ \n\nIndex has climbed over the expansion threshold of 50 in the \n\nsecond quarter of 2024, the first time since summer 2023. \n\nHowever, this is primarily due to the services sector, where \n\nsentiment has recently brightened considerably; the recovery \n\nin private consumption and the positive momentum from \n\nthe UEFA European Men’s Football Championship should \n\nensure a rapid upturn. In addition to the hospitality sector, \n\nfurther consumer-related service providers and consumer \n\ngoods manufacturers are also likely to benefit and expand \n\nproduction. The flooding in southern Germany will however \n\nlikely not significantly disrupt production.\n\nThe recovery of the German economy is projected to gain \n\nsignificant momentum over the further course of the fore­\n\ncast. Private consumption will be the main driver and remain \n\nsupported by continued positive wage development, rising \n\nemployment, and declining unemployment. As the econo­\n\nmies of important trading partners are also likely to recover, \n\nforeign trade should also expand on a sustained basis from \n\nthe second half of 2024. In addition to this is the expected \n\nupturn in global industrial production, which will benefit \n\nfrom the expected interest rate turnaround by the major cen­\n\ntral banks and should boost German exports. This should \n\nalso somewhat revive the momentum of private equipment \n\ninvestment if companies expand their capacities again in \n\nview of rising demand, particularly in 2025. In addition, \n\nthere are strong investment stimuli from the public sec­\n\ntor. For example, more funds for military expenditure are \n\nlikely to be drawn from the special fund for the German \n\narmed forces (Bundeswehr). Only construction investment \n\nwill continue to stagnate in the second half of 2024 due to \n\nthe ongoing weak performance of residential construction \n\nTable 2\n\nQuarterly data on the development of use and value-added components of real GDP in Germany\n\nIn percent (quarter-on-quarter, seasonally and calendar adjusted)\n\n \n\n2023\n\n2024\n\n2025\n\nI\n\nII\n\nIII\n\nIV\n\nI\n\nII\n\nIII\n\nIV\n\nI\n\nII\n\nIII\n\nIV\n\nPrivate consumption\n\n−0.7\n\n0.3\n\n0.0\n\n0.4\n\n−0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\nPublic consumption expenditure\n\n−1.3\n\n0.1\n\n1.4\n\n0.6\n\n−0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\nGross capital formation\n\n1.0\n\n−0.1\n\n0.1\n\n−2.1\n\n1.2\n\n−0.5\n\n−0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\nConstruction\n\n1.5\n\n−0.5\n\n−0.7\n\n−1.9\n\n2.7\n\n−0.9\n\n−0.4\n\n−0.1\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\nEquipment\n\n1.9\n\n0.7\n\n1.4\n\n−4.0\n\n−0.2\n\n−0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.7\n\n0.9\n\n1.0\n\n1.1\n\n1.1\n\nOther investment\n\n−1.6\n\n0.0\n\n0.3\n\n0.7\n\n−1.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\nChange in inventories1\n\n−0.1\n\n0.2\n\n−0.6\n\n−0.7\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\nDomestic consumption\n\n−0.5\n\n0.4\n\n−0.3\n\n−0.8\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\nNet exports\n\n0.8\n\n−0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\nExports\n\n0.5\n\n−0.7\n\n−0.9\n\n−0.9\n\n1.1\n\n0.6\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.9\n\n0.7\n\n0.7\n\n0.7\n\nImports\n\n−1.1\n\n0.2\n\n−1.8\n\n−1.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\nGDP\n\n0.3\n\n−0.1\n\n0.1\n\n−0.5\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\nGross value added\n\n0.4\n\n−0.1\n\n0.1\n\n−0.5\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\nManufacturing\n\n0.7\n\n0.0\n\n−1.1\n\n−1.7\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\nConstruction\n\n3.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n−2.0\n\n2.5\n\n−0.8\n\n−0.3\n\n0.1\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\nTrade, hospitality, transport\n\n−0.8\n\n0.0\n\n1.3\n\n−1.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\nProfessional services providers\n\n−0.1\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.5\n\n−0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\nPublic services, education, health \n\n1.2\n\n−0.5\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n1.1\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n1 Contribution to growth in percentage points. \n\nNote: Forecast from the second quarter of 2024 onwards.\n\nSources: Federal Statistical Office; DIW Berlin Economic Outlook Summer 2024.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\n175\n\nDIW Weekly Report 24+25+26/2024\n\nGERMAN ECONOMY\n\nand will first contribute to economic growth again in 2025, \n\ndriven primarily by investments in rail and energy networks. \n\nReconstruction and repair work following the flooding in \n\nsouthern Germany should not substantially alter this picture.\n\nIn addition to monetary policy, which is only gradually \n\nbecoming less restrictive, fiscal policy also displays a restric­\n\ntive orientation: A large number of fiscal policy measures \n\nthat were introduced in response to the energy price crisis \n\n(above all the electricity and gas price brakes, the stabiliza­\n\ntion of transmission grid fees, and aid for hospitals and care \n\nfacilities) have already ended or will end in 2024. In 2025, \n\nrestrictive stimuli such as the end of the tax-free inflation \n\ncompensation premium are also likely to outweigh expan­\n\nsionary stimuli from the Wachstumschancengesetz (Growth \n\nOpportunities Act) and the special fund for the Bundeswehr. \n\nIn line with this, government deficits are expected to decrease \n\nslightly, falling from 2.4 percent in relation to GDP in 2023 \n\nto 1.9 percent in 2024 and further to 1.3 percent in 2025.\n\nAll in all, price-adjusted GDP will likely rise slightly by \n\n0.3 percent in 2024 (Table 3). Growth is projected to be \n\n1.3 percent in 2025. Thus, DIW Berlin is increasing its fore­\n\ncast for 2024 by 0.3 percentage points and for 2025 by 0.1 per­\n\ncentage points. The main factors for the improved forecasts \n\nare the unexpectedly strong first quarter of 2024 as well as \n\nslightly stronger momentum over the course of the year, \n\nwhich should benefit from the fact that the global economy \n\nand, in particular, important trading partners will recover \n\nsomewhat more quickly.\n\nPotential GDP will likely develop weakly until the end of 2028, \n\nprimarily due to the negative development of labor volume. \n\nIn light of the moderate expansion in 2024, the output gap \n\nin 2024 is likely to grow somewhat larger and amount to an \n\nannual average of -1.6 percent of potential GDP. In 2025, the \n\noutput gap is expected to fall to -0.6, and by 2028 it should \n\nclose completely.\n\nFollowing the significant rise of 5.9 percent in consumer \n\nprices last year, inflation is expected to average 2.3 percent \n\nin 2024 and 2.0 percent in 2025. Thus, DIW Berlin’s infla­\n\ntion forecast remains unchanged compared to the spring. In \n\nlight of the higher price increases for services, the core rate \n\nis likely to average 2.7 percent in 2024 and fall to 2.0 percent \n\nin 2025 as wage growth slows.\n\nIn addition to the global risks, there are also domestic uncer­\n\ntainties for the German economy, such as the recent flood­\n\ning in the southern part of the country and the associated \n\ndamage. The consequences of the flooding in Bavaria and \n\nBaden-Württemberg could be much greater than assumed \n\nin this forecast. For example, it is possible that production \n\ncapacity is disrupted more than initially expected, with the \n\ncorresponding consequences for industrial output. This is \n\na downside risk for the forecast. However, an upside risk \n\nis also conceivable: If damage to residential buildings and \n\npublic infrastructure is greater than expected, the resulting \n\nreconstruction work could boost economic output, espe­\n\ncially from 2025.\n\nAnother domestic risk for the German economy is the \n\nunclear economic policy framework, in particular the upcom­\n\ning budget for 2025. If a budget agreement is significantly \n\ndelayed, this could make private households and companies \n\nuneasy and thus lead to a reluctance to consume and invest.\n\nTable 3\n\nKey economic indicators for the German economy\n\n2023\n\n2024\n\n2025\n\nGDP1\n\n−0.2\n\n0.3\n\n1.3\n\nEmployed2 (1,000 persons)\n\n45,932\n\n46,072\n\n46,153\n\nUnemployed (1,000 persons)\n\n2.609\n\n2.731\n\n2.608\n\nUnemployment rate3 (Federal Employment Agency \n\nconcept, in percent)\n\n5.7\n\n5.9\n\n5.6\n\nConsumer prices4\n\n5.9\n\n2.3\n\n2.0\n\nUnit labor costs5\n\n6.6\n\n4.6\n\n2.4\n\nGovernment budget balance6\n\nin billions of euros\n\n−99.1\n\n−82.8\n\n−56.5\n\nin percent of nominal GDP\n\n−2.4\n\n−1.9\n\n−1.3\n\nCurrent account balance\n\nin billions of euros\n\n243.1\n\n321.9\n\n351.9\n\nin percent of nominal GDP\n\n5.9\n\n7.6\n\n8.0\n\n1 Price adjusted.

A \n\nsharp rise in construction investment, albei more of a flash \n\nin he pan as a resul of mild winter weather, along with \n\nstrong goods exports helped he economy onto its recov­\n\nery path and masked he disappointing developmen of \n\nprivate consumption, which sank unexpectedly. However, \n\nconsumer sentimen has since brightened considerably: \n\nFollowing he recen special payments, employees in many \n\nsectors are now earning more on a permanen basis due \n\nto pay raises, which increases income security. In conjunc­\n\ntion with he inflation rate now being stable a below he \n\nthree-percen hreshold, real wages are rising significantly. \n\nAdded o his is he urnaround in interes rates initiated \n\nby he European Central Bank, which is making saving less \n\na ractive and loans more affordable. The UEFA European \n\nMen’s Football Championship, which is being held in Ger­\n\nmany his year, is also likely o boos consumption, albei \n\nslightly.\n\nIn addition o private consumption, foreign rade will prove \n\nto be he second mainstay of he German economy in he \n\nforecas period. On he one hand, imports are increasing \n\nas he domestic economy becomes stronger. On he other \n\nhand, he German expor industry will also experience a \n\nsignifican boost, as industrial production is likely o pick up \n\nworldwide. Due o he high share of intermediate products \n\nand investmen goods, exports “made in Germany” are \n\nparticularly dependen on he global industry’s economic \n\nsituation. In Germany, oo, industrial companies will begin \n\ninvesting more in heir capacities from 2025 a he latest. \n\nConstruction investmen will hen also rise again.\n\nOverall, he outlook is somewha more positive han i was \n\nin he spring: Instead of stagnating, DIW Berlin now expects \n\nthe German economy o grow by 0.3 percen in 2024 and \n\nby 1.3 percen in 2025. One risk factor for he forecas \n\nis ha he full exten of he damage from he flooding in \n\nsouthern Germany is still unclear. In some places, pro­\n\nduction capacities could remain impaired for longer han \n\nexpected. A he same ime, i is also conceivable ha \n\nrepair and reconstruction work could increase economic \n\noutput. Overall, however, he effects in one way or he other \n\nare likely o remain manageable. In addition, he ug-of-war \n\nover he nex federal budge could once again become a \n\nfactor contributing o uncertainty, possibly even more so \n\nthan was already o be expected after he results of he EU \n\nelections in Germany.\n\nThe global economy will also gain some momentum over \n\nthe forecas period. The euro area is finally overcoming its \n\nweak phase for good and international rade is picking up \n\nspeed. The interes rate urnaround in he major advanced \n\neconomies will likely have a positive effec on residential \n\nconstruction and corporate investments from he second \n\nhalf of 2024. Overall, he global economy is expected o \n\ngrow by 3.7 percen in 2024 and by 3.6 percen in 2025.\n\n169\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 24+25+26/2024\n\nGLOBAL ECONOMY\n\nThe global economy developed be er han expected in he \n\nfirs quarter of 2024 in particular due o he recovery of \n\ndomestic demand in mos advanced economies. Among \n\nthe emerging economies, China performed surprisingly \n\nwell in erms of high exports and strong industrial output.\n\nIn Europe, real wage increases have finally arrived in he \n\npockets of consumers and are boosting private consumption. \n\nQuarter-on-quarter he economy expanded by 0.3 and 0.6 per­\n\ncen in he euro area and he United Kingdom, respectively. \n\nEconomic growth in he United States was a 0.3 percen and \n\ncontinues o be carried by consumer spending. In contrast, \n\ninflation is weighing strongly on domestic demand in Japan, \n\nwhere GDP shrunk by 0.5 percen in he firs quarter of 2024. \n\nOf he emerging economies, he Indian and Chinese econ­\n\nomies experienced he mos growth. The Chinese economy \n\nexpanded by 1.6 percent, more han in he previous quarter; \n\nthis was driven primarily by industrial outpu and exports, \n\nwhile domestic demand continued o develop weakly. Overall, \n\nthe global economy expanded by 1.0 percen in he firs quar­\n\nter of 2024, similar o he fourth quarter of 2023 (Figure 1).\n\nThe global economy should continue its recovery into he \n\ncurren second quarter of 2024. The upswing in he advanced \n\neconomies will receive a bi more momentum, especially due \n\nto he euro area economy, where falling inflation rates com­\n\nbined with rising nominal wages are leading o rising real \n\nwages. This should boos he purchasing power of consum­\n\ners as well as domestic demand. The upswing in he United \n\nKingdom is also likely o continue; he favorable outlook for \n\nservices points o a further increase in consumption. The \n\nUS economy, in contrast, is expected o expand only mod­\n\nerately, as private households’ remaining excess savings are \n\nrunning out, cooling private consumption. In Japan, high \n\ninflation is continuing o weigh on economic growth. The \n\nManufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Indices have been \n\nrecovering in mos advanced economies since he beginning \n\nof 2024. The May values for Japan, he United Kingdom, and \n\nthe United States are consistently over he hreshold expan­\n\nsion of 50. The value for he euro area remained under 50, \n\nbu experienced a strong increase from 45.7 in April o 47.3 \n\nin May. Thus, industrial outpu is likely o gradually pick \n\nup speed.\n\nThe emerging economies are expected o cool down in he \n\nsecond quarter following a strong firs quarter. While eco­\n\nnomic developmen in China and India continues o suppor \n\ngrowth, other countries such as Brazil and Mexico are experi­\n\nencing weak growth due o dampened domestic demand. In \n\ncontrast, here are signs of a recovery in economic momen­\n\ntum in China, mainly due o more expansive monetary and \n\nfiscal policies. Moreover, he recovery of he global econ­\n\nomy is likely o boos Chinese exports. Continued dynamic \n\ngrowth is expected for he Indian economy in he second \n\nquarter hanks o solid domestic demand.\n\nInternational rade recovered by 0.3 percen in he firs quar­\n\nter of 2024, following a decline of 1.9 percen in 2023. Weak \n\ndemand from advanced economies and ongoing geopolitical \n\nturmoil weighed on international rade in 2023. Nevertheless, \n\nsome rade barriers have partly been dissolved since he \n\nbeginning of he year: For example, circumventing blockaded \n\ntrade routes from Asia o Europe by means of an alternative \n\nAfrican route is now factored into supply chains and produc­\n\ntion. This and he gradual recovery of he global economy \n\nare likely o lead o international rade picking up somewha \n\nin 2024, albei less strongly han before he pandemic. One \n\nimportan reason for his is ha rade policy conflicts, espe­\n\ncially between Western countries and China, will continue \n\nto have a dampening effect. The punitive ariffs imposed by \n\nthe US governmen on Chinese electric vehicles and sem­\n\niconductors in May 2024 emphasize he fac ha he situa­\n\ntion is no expected o ease anytime soon.\n\nMonetary policy in many advanced economies remained \n\nrestrictive a he beginning of 2024 and interes rates were \n\nstill high. The firs key interes rate cuts were made in spring \n\nGlobal economy: Advanced economies once again \n\npicking up speed\n\nFigure 1\n\nGrowth of real GDP\n\nQuarter-on-quarter percentage growth (lef axis); index 2015 \n\nQ1 = 100 (righ axis)\n\n \n\nSources: National Statistical Offices; DIW Berlin Economic Outlook Summer 2024.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nThe advanced economies are contributing somewha more o economic growth again. \n\n170\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 24+25+26/2024\n\nGLOBAL ECONOMY\n\n2024 in ligh of lower inflation rates only in isolated cases, \n\nsuch as in Switzerland. I is expected ha other central banks \n\nwill begin lowering heir interes rates in he summer (Box). \n\nIn he euro area, his urnaround happened on June 6th, \n\nsooner han in he United States and he United Kingdom \n\ndue o rapidly falling inflation rates. Commodity prices are \n\nalso no longer likely o provide any price-driving impetus. \n\nJapan is a special case, as its inflation is still well above he \n\nBank of Japan’s wo-percen arge as of April 2024 a 2.5 per­\n\ncent, which is unusually high for he country.\n\nMonetary policy has once again become somewha less \n\nrestrictive in many emerging economies. There have already \n\nbeen regular key interes rate cuts in Brazil since he end \n\nof 2023 due o declining inflation rates and low economic \n\ngrowth, while Mexico decreased its key interes rates in \n\nMarch 2024. In February 2024, he People’s Bank of China \n\nalso adopted a more expansive course by lowering its mini­\n\nmum reserves o suppor he struggling economy and com­\n\nba deflationary rends. In India, he key interes rate will \n\nlikely no be lowered until he hird quarter because food \n\nBox\n\nAssumptions and framework conditions\n\nThe forecas is based on he following assumptions abou he \n\nfurther developmen of key interes rates, exchange rates, and \n\ncommodity prices (Table). These assumptions were made based \n\non previous development, futures markets prices, and he closing \n\nprices on he date of his forecas (14. May 2024).\n\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) firs decreased interes rates in \n\nJune, as was assumed in he spring forecast. After a year of stable \n\ninteres rates, i has now initiated a urnaround; further interes \n\nrate cuts will follow. We assume five subsequen cuts over he \n\nforecasting horizon. In detail, we assume a cu of 35 basis points \n\na he September 2024 meeting, and subsequen cuts every \n\nquarter of respectively 25 basis points.1 Taken ogether, his leads \n\nto a decline of 85 basis points in 2024 and of 75 basis points in \n\n2025. The ECB has hus initiated an interes rate cu before he \n\nUS Federal Reserve. The Fed and he Bank of England will presum­\n\nably no lower interes rates until he hird quarter of 2024.\n\nMoney marke interes rates fell a he beginning of 2024 in antici-\n\npation of he interes rate urnaround. I is assumed ha hese, in \n\nline with key interes rates, will continue o fall over he forecas \n\nhorizon. The refinancing costs for households and companies are \n\n1 \n\nFurthermore, he ECB is expected o reduce he corridor between he deposi facility rate and \n\nthe main refinancing rate o 15 basis points from September 18, 2024.\n\nlikely o decline as key interes rates fall over he nex years. The \n\nreturn on governmen bonds slightly increased again following a \n\nbrief decline in winter 2023. I is assumed ha capital marke inter­\n\nes rates will remain largely unchanged over he forecas horizon \n\na 2.6 percen for Germany and 3.1 percen for he euro area. The \n\neuro has recently depreciated agains he US dollar due o he \n\ninteres rate differential. For he forecas period, i is assumed ha \n\nthe exchange rate of EUR o USD will remain a 1,08 USD per EUR, \n\nthe level reached a he end of he data period on June 6.\n\nUncertainties abou he gas supply in he coming year resulted \n\nin sligh increases in he wholesale price for gas (TTF) recently. \n\nHowever, well-filled gas storage facilities should preven a severe \n\nsupply shortage. According o futures, he average gas price \n\nshould be around 30.90 and 35.50 euros per megawa hours in \n\n2024 and 2025, respectively. According o raded futures, he price \n\nfor Bren oil should increase slightly in he coming months before \n\ndeclining again a he star of 2025 until he end of he forecas \n\nperiod. In 2024, he average price is likely o be 83 USD per barrel \n\nbefore i declines o an average of 78 USD per barrel in 2025.\n\nThis forecas is also based on political assumptions: We assume \n\ntha no further escalations will occur, bu also ha none of he cur­\n\nren geopolitical crises, such as he Israeli-Hamas war, he Russo-\n\nUkrainian War, and conflic between China and Taiwan, will end.\n\nTable\n\nForecas assumptions\n\n \n\n \n\n2022\n\n2023\n\n2024\n\n2025\n\nECB key interes rate (year end)\n\nPercent\n\n2.5\n\n4.5\n\n3.7\n\n2.9\n\nMoney marke interes rate\n\nThree-month EURIBOR in percent\n\n0.3\n\n3.4\n\n3.6\n\n2.9\n\nCapital marke interest\n\nYield on euro-area governmen bonds with a remaining erm of en years \n\n2.3\n\n3.2\n\n3.0\n\n3.1\n\nCapital marke interest\n\nYield on German governmen bonds with a remaining erm of en years \n\n1.8\n\n2.5\n\n2.6\n\n2.6\n\nExchange rate\n\nUSD/EUR\n\n1.05\n\n1.09\n\n1.08\n\n1.08\n\nCrude oil price\n\nUSD per barrel \n\n98.6\n\n82.1\n\n83.0\n\n78.0\n\nGas price\n\nEUR per megawa hour\n\n133.9\n\n42.2\n\n30.9\n\n35.5\n\nNote: Annual average unless indicated otherwise.

On he one hand, his is due o \n\nthe fac ha measures aken o comba he energy crisis are \n\nexpiring. On he other hand, higher interes rates are pu ing \n\ngovernments under pressure o reduce expenditure, which is \n\nlikely o be o he detrimen of medium-term investmen pro­\n\ngrams.

Economic outpu will likely increase by \n\n4.9 percen in he emerging economies. Overall, he global \n\neconomy is expected o grow by 3.7 percen in 2024 (Table 1). \n\nAs he developmen in he euro area as well as in China was \n\nbe er han expected in he firs half of 2024, DIW Berlin is \n\nincreasing its forecas for he entire year by 0.2 percentage \n\npoints. In 2025, he global economy is likely o increase by \n\n3.6 percent, unchanged from he spring forecast.\n\nThis forecas is based on several uncertainty factors. On \n\nthe one hand, geopolitical risks remain quite high. The cri­\n\nses relating o he ongoing Israel-Hamas War could spread \n\nthroughou he region; here is also no end o he Russo-\n\nUkrainian War in sight. There are also simmering geopo­\n\nlitical conflicts in Asia concerning he Korean peninsula or \n\nTaiwan, for example. A possible intensification of hese geo­\n\npolitical conflicts harbors many risks for he global economy, \n\nfrom emporarily higher energy and resource prices o major \n\ntrade distortions and real economic losses.\n\nA further risk factor is public deb sustainability in ligh of \n\nhigher interes rates.

A leas some of he energy-intensive companies \n\nhave relocated production abroad by now and cu jobs in \n\nGermany in ligh of he country’s comparatively high energy \n\ncosts. Together with he strong expansion in he construction \n\nindustry, industrial production was also able o increase over­\n\nall and contribute positively o gross value added with nearly \n\n0.1 percentage points. However, he overall increase was pri­\n\nmarily carried by services; both he consumer-related (around \n\n0.1 percentage points) as well as public (around 0.2 percent­\n\nage points) service sectors experienced a strong expansion.\n\nIn he curren second quarter, he German economy is likely \n\nto increase again by 0.2 percen (Table 2). Private consumption \n\nin particular should improve on a sustained basis. Households \n\nare slowly gaining purchasing power due o continuously ris­\n\ning real wages. Following he one-time special payments ha \n\nwere paid o employees in many sectors in 2023, he collec­\n\ntive wage increases are now in effec in many places, which \n\nresults in employees permanently earning more money. This \n\nis likely o strengthen income security. The strong growth in \n\nreal wages is a relief o low-income households in particular, \n\nThe German economy is slowly exiting its slump, starting ou \n\n2024 with momentum following weak performance in 2023.3 \n\nEconomic outpu increased by 0.2 percen in he firs quar­\n\nter of 2024, more han previously expected (Figure 2).4 The \n\nrobus growth rate in he firs quarter was due in particular \n\nto a surprisingly strong increase in construction investmen \n\nas a resul of mild winter weather. In addition, goods exports \n\nrose unexpectedly sharply, resulting in a positive rade bal­\n\nance. Meanwhile, private consumption continued o decline \n\ndespite falling inflation rates and rising disposable incomes.\n\nHigh interes rates and he German government’s polit­\n\nical indecisiveness seemed o have dampened consumer \n\nsentimen a he beginning of 2024. Even strong growth in \n\nreal wages seemingly could no boos consumer confidence \n\nenough a he beginning of he year o preven a decline in \n\nprivate consumption. The signs for a recovery in private con­\n\nsumption were here a he beginning of 2024: Employmen \n\nincreased and nominal wages rose significantly, for example \n\nin he energy industry and in he public sector a he state \n\nlevel. Together with further declining consumer price infla­\n\ntion, which has been consistently below he hree-percen \n\nthreshold, real wages rose noticeably. The decline in infla­\n\ntion is primarily due o lower food inflation and lower energy \n\ngoods prices. Meanwhile, core inflation, which excludes food­\n\nstuffs and energy, rose more strongly in he firs quarter, \n\nwhich was likely largely due o rising prices for services.\n\nGoods exports increased markedly, especially he expor of \n\nchemical and pharmaceutical products. Chemical products \n\noften serve as he intermediate inputs in further production \n\nprocesses. After heir marked declined due o high energy \n\nprices, heir recen increase migh poin o a gradual recov­\n\nery of global industrial production. German goods imports \n\nalso increased strongly. However, as imports grew less over­\n\nall han exports, here was a positive rade balance in he firs \n\nquarter. Private and public investments also supported eco­\n\nnomic output. The main reason for his was he mild weather, \n\nwhich boosted production in he construction industry and \n\nled o a significan increase in construction investment, par­\n\nticularly in residential construction. In contrast, equipmen \n\ninvestmen declined slightly.\n\nGross value added rose somewha more strongly in he firs \n\nquarter a 0.3 percen han GDP. Production in he manu­\n\nfacturing industry rose slightly. Energy-intensive sectors are \n\nshowing signs of a slow recovery and were able o expand \n\nproduction again for he firs ime following he prolonged \n\n3 According o revised data from he Federal Statistical Office, he decline in economic outpu in \n\nthe fourth quarter of 2023 was somewha more pronounced han had been reported in he spring.\n\n4 This forecas uses price-adjusted figures excep for when describing price and wage develop­\n\nments, public finances, and public debt.\n\nGerman economy: Private consumption becoming \n\nthe driver of he upturn\n\nFigure 2\n\nReal GDP growth in Germany\n\nIn billions of euros (lef axis) and quarter-on-quarter in percen \n\n(righ axis)\n\n \n\nNote: Forecas from he second quarter of 2024 onwards; price, seasonally, and calendar adjusted.\n\nSources: National Statistical Offices; DIW Berlin Economic Outlook Summer 2024.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nThe German economy will grow again in both 2024 and 2025.\n\n174\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 24+25+26/2024\n\nGERMAN ECONOMY\n\nwho are henceforth likely o suppor consumption. Household \n\nsurveys also indicate a lower propensity o save and a greater \n\nwillingness o consume. The UEFA European Men’s Football \n\nChampionship, which is aking place in Germany in early \n\nsummer, will provide additional momentum for private con­\n\nsumption in he second and hird quarters.\n\nThe global economy is boosting foreign demand. German \n\nforeign rade is likely o benefi in particular from he upturn \n\nexperienced by importan euro area rade partners. Imports \n\nare likely o increase a a similar rate o exports, meaning ha \n\nthe overall contribution of foreign rade o GDP in he sec­\n\nond quarter will probably be lower han in he firs quarter.\n\nFollowing he strong star o he year, investments, however, \n\nare unlikely o provide any growth stimuli in he curren sec­\n\nond quarter. A negative countermove o he strong increase \n\nin he firs quarter is expected in construction investment, \n\nmainly due o a decline in residential construction, where \n\nthe situation remains extremely ense. Equipmen invest­\n\nmen is also likely o fall again slightly in ligh of he still \n\nfragile economic situation.\n\nIndustry is also likely o recover rather slowly. Companies \n\nare continuing o view heir situation cautiously. The manu­\n\nfacturing industry has been recording fewer and fewer new \n\norders since 2022 and business expectations are improving \n\nonly slowly. The Global Composite Purchasing Managers’ \n\nIndex has climbed over he expansion hreshold of 50 in he \n\nsecond quarter of 2024, he firs ime since summer 2023. \n\nHowever, his is primarily due o he services sector, where \n\nsentimen has recently brightened considerably; he recovery \n\nin private consumption and he positive momentum from \n\nthe UEFA European Men’s Football Championship should \n\nensure a rapid upturn. In addition o he hospitality sector, \n\nfurther consumer-related service providers and consumer \n\ngoods manufacturers are also likely o benefi and expand \n\nproduction. The flooding in southern Germany will however \n\nlikely no significantly disrup production.\n\nThe recovery of he German economy is projected o gain \n\nsignifican momentum over he further course of he fore­\n\ncast. Private consumption will be he main driver and remain \n\nsupported by continued positive wage development, rising \n\nemployment, and declining unemployment. As he econo­\n\nmies of importan rading partners are also likely o recover, \n\nforeign rade should also expand on a sustained basis from \n\nthe second half of 2024. In addition o his is he expected \n\nupturn in global industrial production, which will benefi \n\nfrom he expected interes rate urnaround by he major cen­\n\ntral banks and should boos German exports. This should \n\nalso somewha revive he momentum of private equipmen \n\ninvestmen if companies expand heir capacities again in \n\nview of rising demand, particularly in 2025. In addition, \n\nthere are strong investmen stimuli from he public sec­\n\ntor. For example, more funds for military expenditure are \n\nlikely o be drawn from he special fund for he German \n\narmed forces (Bundeswehr). Only construction investmen \n\nwill continue o stagnate in he second half of 2024 due o \n\nthe ongoing weak performance of residential construction \n\nTable 2\n\nQuarterly data on he developmen of use and value-added components of real GDP in Germany\n\nIn percen (quarter-on-quarter, seasonally and calendar adjusted)\n\n \n\n2023\n\n2024\n\n2025\n\nI\n\nII\n\nIII\n\nIV\n\nI\n\nII\n\nIII\n\nIV\n\nI\n\nII\n\nIII\n\nIV\n\nPrivate consumption\n\n−0.7\n\n0.3\n\n0.0\n\n0.4\n\n−0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\nPublic consumption expenditure\n\n−1.3\n\n0.1\n\n1.4\n\n0.6\n\n−0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\nGross capital formation\n\n1.0\n\n−0.1\n\n0.1\n\n−2.1\n\n1.2\n\n−0.5\n\n−0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\nConstruction\n\n1.5\n\n−0.5\n\n−0.7\n\n−1.9\n\n2.7\n\n−0.9\n\n−0.4\n\n−0.1\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\nEquipment\n\n1.9\n\n0.7\n\n1.4\n\n−4.0\n\n−0.2\n\n−0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.7\n\n0.9\n\n1.0\n\n1.1\n\n1.1\n\nOther investment\n\n−1.6\n\n0.0\n\n0.3\n\n0.7\n\n−1.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\nChange in inventories1\n\n−0.1\n\n0.2\n\n−0.6\n\n−0.7\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\nDomestic consumption\n\n−0.5\n\n0.4\n\n−0.3\n\n−0.8\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\nNe exports\n\n0.8\n\n−0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\nExports\n\n0.5\n\n−0.7\n\n−0.9\n\n−0.9\n\n1.1\n\n0.6\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.9\n\n0.7\n\n0.7\n\n0.7\n\nImports\n\n−1.1\n\n0.2\n\n−1.8\n\n−1.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\n0.9\n\nGDP\n\n0.3\n\n−0.1\n\n0.1\n\n−0.5\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\nGross value added\n\n0.4\n\n−0.1\n\n0.1\n\n−0.5\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\nManufacturing\n\n0.7\n\n0.0\n\n−1.1\n\n−1.7\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\nConstruction\n\n3.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n−2.0\n\n2.5\n\n−0.8\n\n−0.3\n\n0.1\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\nTrade, hospitality, ransport\n\n−0.8\n\n0.0\n\n1.3\n\n−1.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\nProfessional services providers\n\n−0.1\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.5\n\n−0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\nPublic services, education, health \n\n1.2\n\n−0.5\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n1.1\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n1 Contribution o growth in percentage points. \n\nNote: Forecas from he second quarter of 2024 onwards.\n\nSources: Federal Statistical Office; DIW Berlin Economic Outlook Summer 2024.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\n175\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 24+25+26/2024\n\nGERMAN ECONOMY\n\nand will firs contribute o economic growth again in 2025, \n\ndriven primarily by investments in rail and energy networks. \n\nReconstruction and repair work following he flooding in \n\nsouthern Germany should no substantially alter his picture.\n\nIn addition o monetary policy, which is only gradually \n\nbecoming less restrictive, fiscal policy also displays a restric­\n\ntive orientation: A large number of fiscal policy measures \n\ntha were introduced in response o he energy price crisis \n\n(above all he electricity and gas price brakes, he stabiliza­\n\ntion of ransmission grid fees, and aid for hospitals and care \n\nfacilities) have already ended or will end in 2024. In 2025, \n\nrestrictive stimuli such as he end of he ax-free inflation \n\ncompensation premium are also likely o outweigh expan­\n\nsionary stimuli from he Wachstumschancengesetz (Growth \n\nOpportunities Act) and he special fund for he Bundeswehr. \n\nIn line with his, governmen deficits are expected o decrease \n\nslightly, falling from 2.4 percen in relation o GDP in 2023 \n\nto 1.9 percen in 2024 and further o 1.3 percen in 2025.\n\nAll in all, price-adjusted GDP will likely rise slightly by \n\n0.3 percen in 2024 (Table 3). Growth is projected o be \n\n1.3 percen in 2025. Thus, DIW Berlin is increasing its fore­\n\ncas for 2024 by 0.3 percentage points and for 2025 by 0.1 per­\n\ncentage points. The main factors for he improved forecasts \n\nare he unexpectedly strong firs quarter of 2024 as well as \n\nslightly stronger momentum over he course of he year, \n\nwhich should benefi from he fac ha he global economy \n\nand, in particular, importan rading partners will recover \n\nsomewha more quickly.\n\nPotential GDP will likely develop weakly until he end of 2028, \n\nprimarily due o he negative developmen of labor volume. \n\nIn ligh of he moderate expansion in 2024, he outpu gap \n\nin 2024 is likely o grow somewha larger and amoun o an \n\nannual average of -1.6 percen of potential GDP. In 2025, he \n\noutpu gap is expected o fall o -0.6, and by 2028 i should \n\nclose completely.\n\nFollowing he significan rise of 5.9 percen in consumer \n\nprices las year, inflation is expected o average 2.3 percen \n\nin 2024 and 2.0 percen in 2025. Thus, DIW Berlin’s infla­\n\ntion forecas remains unchanged compared o he spring. In \n\nligh of he higher price increases for services, he core rate \n\nis likely o average 2.7 percen in 2024 and fall o 2.0 percen \n\nin 2025 as wage growth slows.\n\nIn addition o he global risks, here are also domestic uncer­\n\ntainties for he German economy, such as he recen flood­\n\ning in he southern par of he country and he associated \n\ndamage. The consequences of he flooding in Bavaria and \n\nBaden-Wür emberg could be much greater han assumed \n\nin his forecast. For example, i is possible ha production \n\ncapacity is disrupted more han initially expected, with he \n\ncorresponding consequences for industrial output. This is \n\na downside risk for he forecast. However, an upside risk \n\nis also conceivable: If damage o residential buildings and \n\npublic infrastructure is greater han expected, he resulting \n\nreconstruction work could boos economic output, espe­\n\ncially from 2025.\n\nAnother domestic risk for he German economy is he \n\nunclear economic policy framework, in particular he upcom­\n\ning budge for 2025. If a budge agreemen is significantly \n\ndelayed, his could make private households and companies \n\nuneasy and hus lead o a reluctance o consume and invest.\n\nTable 3\n\nKey economic indicators for he German economy\n\n2023\n\n2024\n\n2025\n\nGDP1\n\n−0.2\n\n0.3\n\n1.3\n\nEmployed2 (1,000 persons)\n\n45,932\n\n46,072\n\n46,153\n\nUnemployed (1,000 persons)\n\n2.609\n\n2.731\n\n2.608\n\nUnemploymen rate3 (Federal Employmen Agency \n\nconcept, in percent)\n\n5.7\n\n5.9\n\n5.6\n\nConsumer prices4\n\n5.9\n\n2.3\n\n2.0\n\nUni labor costs5\n\n6.6\n\n4.6\n\n2.4\n\nGovernmen budge balance6\n\nin billions of euros\n\n−99.1\n\n−82.8\n\n−56.5\n\nin percen of nominal GDP\n\n−2.4\n\n−1.9\n\n−1.3\n\nCurren accoun balance\n\nin billions of euros\n\n243.1\n\n321.9\n\n351.9\n\nin percen of nominal GDP\n\n5.9\n\n7.6\n\n8.0\n\n1 Price adjusted.
