Prices have since relaxed, \n\nthe European natural gas industry has overcome the uncer­\n\ntainty due to the energy crisis in 2022, and the industry also \n\nsurvived the slump in Russian natural gas imports without sup­\n\nply interruptions. However, Russia continues to export lique­\n\nfied natural gas (LNG) to Europe and still has some countries in \n\nCentral and Eastern Europe under control in terms of energy \n\npolicy, which has so far prevented EU sanctions on Russian \n\nnatural gas exports. Both the German and European natural \n\ngas supplies would be secure in the long term without Russian \n\nimports, as shown by model calculations using the Global \n\nGas Model which depicts the global natural gas industry in \n\ngreat detail. Security of supply is, thus, not standing in the way \n\nof further EU sanctions against Russia. Increased efforts to \n\nsave energy and a timely natural gas phase-out would reduce \n\ndependency on gas imports, which will also contribute to \n\nclimate change mitigation.\n\nRussian natural gas exports to the European Union have \n\nreduced drastically over the course of the Russo-Ukrainian \n\nWar. As a result, there have been concerns in the EU that \n\nRussian imports could not be adequately replaced. Member \n\nStates were therefore not able to agree on sanctions against \n\nRussian natural gas, unlike for coal and pipeline-based oil \n\nexports. The EU is currently considering a new push for \n\ngas sanctions against Russia that are directed against the \n\ntransshipment of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) in \n\nEuropean ports.\n\nAs the gas transit agreement between Russia and Ukraine \n\nwill expire at the end of 2024 and the Russo-Ukrainian war is \n\nstill ongoing, a complete stop of all Russian imports to the EU \n\nis conceivable. In contrast, it is less likely that international \n\nrelations will recover and that the volume of Russian gas \n\nimports will increase again. Therefore, this Weekly Report \n\nuses a model to analyze the effects of various scenarios on \n\nthe European natural gas supply. The analysis also consid­\n\ners differentiated developments regarding the global natu­\n\nral gas supply and demand that could occur depending on \n\nvarious climate policy scenarios.\n\nA disruption of Russian natural gas imports is a scenario \n\nthat has been frequently analyzed, even before the Russo-\n\nUkrainian War.1 Theoretically, a reduction of supplies can be \n\ncompensated for in three ways. First, Russian imports could \n\nbe replaced by imports from other sources; second, demand \n\ncan be reduced and energy can be saved; and third, infra­\n\nstructure bottlenecks can be eliminated, for example through \n\nmore efficient pipeline management. These measures are \n\nreflected in the political strategies from 2022, such as in the \n\nRePowerEU package.2\n\n1 \n\nCf. for example Hella Engerer et al. “European Natural Gas Supply Secure Despite Political \n\n Crises” DIW Economic Bulletin no. 8 (2014) (available online; accessed May 21, 2024. This applies \n\nto all other online sources in this report unless stated otherwise); Franziska Holz et al., “European \n\nNatural Gas Infrastructure: The Role of Gazprom in European Natural Gas Supplies,” DIW Politik­\n\nberatung kompakt no. 81 (2014) (available online). The topic has been discussed ever since, cf. for \n\nexample Nikita Moskalenko et al., “Europe’s independence from Russian natural gas —  Effects \n\nof import restrictions on energy system development,” Energy Reports 11 (2014): 2853–2866 \n\n(available online).\n\n2 European Commission, REPowerEU-Plan (2022) (available online).\n\n151\n\nDIW Weekly Report 21/2024\n\nNATURAL GAS SUPPLY\n\nEU countries were able to quickly compensate for \n\nlower Russian exports in 2022\n\nAs a result of the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War, Russia \n\ninterrupted its supply of natural gas to pipelines exporting \n\ndirectly to Germany and Poland. Nevertheless, Russia is cur­\n\nrently still supplying numerous EU Member States, both via \n\nTürkiye as well as via LNG and, paradoxically, via Ukraine \n\n(Box 1). For example, as of winter 2023–2024, more than \n\n95 percent of Austria’s gas imports are from Russia.3 The \n\nongoing dependency of Central and Eastern EU Member \n\nStates on Russia is an important reason that the EU did not \n\nsanction Russian natural gas exports.\n\nIn each of the first two quarters of 2021—before the Russo-\n\nUkrainian War began—the EU purchased over 40 billion \n\ncubic meters of natural gas from Russia, which corresponded \n\nto over 45 percent of the EU’s total gas imports. In the same \n\nperiod in 2023, this amount was reduced to 10.5 billion cubic \n\nmeters per quarter. Of that, three billion cubic meters were \n\ndelivered via Ukraine and around 2.5 billion cubic meters \n\nvia Türkiye. Moreover, around five billion cubic meters of \n\nRussian LNG are imported each quarter.4\n\nHowever, the gas transit agreement between Russia and \n\nUkraine will end on December 31, 2024. At the same time, \n\nit is unlikely that the Nord Stream and Nord Stream 2 Baltic \n\nSea pipelines will be recommissioned in the near future due \n\nto the ongoing war and physical damage to the pipelines as \n\na result of explosions in September 2022. Overall, this leads \n\nto the question of whether Europe would have a sufficient \n\nsupply without Russian natural gas via Ukraine and Türkiye \n\nand LNG imports.\n\nDevelopment of European natural gas markets \n\ndepending on supply and demand\n\nThis Weekly Report uses the Global Gas Model (GGM), which \n\nhas been used in research and policy advice for many years \n\n(Box 2), to analyze the medium and long-term European \n\nnatural gas supply. For Europe, the effects of global climate \n\npolicy trends in particular are decisive for global natural gas \n\nproduction and demand as well as geopolitical developments \n\nrelated to Russia. Therefore, two global climate action sce-\n\nnarios on the demand side are combined with three  scenarios \n\nfor Russian exports on the supply side.\n\nScenarios for the development of EU gas demand \n\nand Russian supply limitations\n\nThe different climate policy ambitions are depicted in two \n\nexemplary scenarios. In the first scenario, which could be \n\nconsidered our reference scenario, global natural gas demand \n\nis reduced rapidly until 2050, as would be expected with \n\n3 Bundesministerium für Klimaschutz, Umwelt, Energie, Mobilität, Innovation und Technologie, \n\nÖsterreichs Energie-Infoportal (2024) (in German; available online).\n\n4 Cf. the data in Ben McWilliams et al, European Natural Gas Imports (Bruegel Datasets) \n\n( available online), which has been continuously updated since June 2022.\n\nambitious climate policy (scenario with rapidly declining \n\nnatural gas demand). In the second scenario, natural gas \n\ndemand is reduced at a delayed pace until it falls to zero in \n\n2050 (scenario with slowly declining natural gas demand). \n\nThis would be conceivable if, for example, natural gas first \n\nhad to compensate for the missing power generation from \n\nclosing nuclear power plants. In this scenario, natural gas \n\ndemand in the EU remains at a constant level until the 2030s. \n\nSimultaneously, there is a marked decline in European natu­\n\nral gas production. Thus, this scenario has the highest import \n\ndependency in the next years (Figure 1).5\n\n5 Other scenarios are conceivable, such as those in which a complete natural gas phase-out \n\nis not achieved by 2050. Two scenarios were defined that do not meet the requirements of the \n\nParis Agreement. In the Moderate Climate Ambition scenario, global natural gas demand de­\n\nclines and there are moderately improved climate action ambitions in Europe. In the No Climate \n\nAmbition scenario, in contrast, there is unlimited use of natural gas without climate action. Both \n\nscenarios result in lower medium-term import demand in Europe than the scenario with slowly \n\ndecreasing demand described in this Weekly Report. Cf. the data specifications of these scenarios \n\n(available online).\n\nFigure 1\n\nDevelopment of global natural gas demand until 2050 by \n\nclimate action scenario\n\nIn billion cubic meters per year\n\n \n\nSource: Authors’ calculations.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nThe current global natural gas demand of 3,800 billion cubic meters falls to zero by \n\n2050 in both scenarios.\n\n152\n\nDIW Weekly Report 21/2024\n\nNATURAL GAS SUPPLY\n\nBoth demand scenarios are combined with different assump­\n\ntions about the availability of Russian natural gas in Europe: \n\nThe New Normal Scenario roughly corresponds to the cur­\n\nrent situation as of 2024, with partially available capacities via \n\nUkraine and Türkiye as well as unlimited imports of Russian \n\nLNG. This is compared to a scenario with a complete stop \n\nof Russian imports to Europe (Sanctions Scenario) and to \n\na scenario assuming large volumes of imports from Russia \n\n(Pre-War Scenario). The last scenario is somewhat differ­\n\nent from the situation before 2022 because it includes the \n\nincreased diversification efforts of European imports com­\n\npared to the 2010s.\n\nRussian natural gas could be replaced in the \n\nentire EU\n\nIt became clear in 2022 that Russian natural gas could be \n\nlargely replaced by a combination of imports from other \n\nsources and a decline in demand. However, Central and \n\nEastern European countries are still purchasing Russian \n\npipeline gas and LNG. As the New Normal Scenario shows, \n\nit is possible to continue this import strategy in the short \n\nterm, both with rapidly declining demand (Figure 2, top) as \n\nwell as delayed declining demand (Figure 3, top). The share \n\nof Russian gas would fall to around ten to 15 percent of the \n\nEuropean natural gas supply in the long run.\n\nThe model calculations show that completely foregoing \n\nRussian natural gas (Sanctions Scenario) would be possible \n\nfor the EU and would require demand to decline only slightly. \n\nThis is made possible as a result of sufficient available import \n\ncapacities and ample natural gas volumes on the global mar­\n\nket (Figure 2, center).6 In this case, more LNG would be \n\n6 The prices calculated in the model increase only moderately in the EU Member States ( approx. \n\nten percent). However, it must be noted that equilibrium prices are calculated, which do not in­\n\nclude factors such as uncertainty and short-term adjustments. However, such factors caused the \n\nenormous price increase in 2022 to, at times, almost ten times the pre-war price.\n\nBox 1\n\nThe history of natural gas and geopolitics\n\nNatural gas has been a significant part of the European energy \n\nsystem since the 1970s. Since then, geopolitics has played a cen­\n\ntral role in issues such as price setting and security of supply. To \n\nsecure the supply of Germany and other European countries, long-\n\nterm contracts have been concluded with governments, such as \n\none with the Netherlands in the 1970s and one with Norway in the \n\n1980s.1 As natural gas markets became globalized through the de­\n\nvelopment of LNG transport, these agreements were expanded to \n\nother continents. As of 2024, the global LNG market is  dominated \n\nby American, Australian, and Qatari suppliers.\n\nNatural gas delivered via pipeline from the Soviet Union was part \n\nof the Western European energy mix even during the Cold War. \n\nHowever, it has been viewed critically by the USA from the begin­\n\nning.2 While the USA’s embargo threats in the 1960s still blocked \n\nrapprochement, some Western European countries and the Soviet \n\nUnion concluded long-term contracts from the early 1970s on­\n\nward that established the delivery and financing of pipelines by \n\nGermany in exchange for the Soviet natural gas supplies.\n\nUp until the 1990s, the Member States of the current EU obtained \n\nSoviet natural gas almost exclusively via Ukraine. Back then, this \n\npipeline system had a capacity of nearly 150 billion cubic meters \n\nper year, more than one third of the current natural gas con­\n\nsumption in the EU.3 Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, \n\n1 \n\nAnne Neumann, Sophia Rüster, and Christian von Hirschhausen, “Long-Term Contracts in the \n\nNatural Gas Industry – Literature Survey and Data on 426 Contracts (1965–2014),” DIW Data Docu­\n\nmentation no. 77 (2015) (available online).\n\n2 For more on this, see Otto Wolff von Amerongen, Der Weg nach Osten: Vierzig Jahre Brücken­\n\nbau für die deutsche Wirtschaft (Munich: Droemer Knaur, 1992): 208ff (in German).\n\n3 However, due to a lack of pipeline maintenance and the decommissioning of individual \n\n border-crossing points, this capacity has declined in the past decades.\n\nRussia diversified its export routes, primarily to avoid geostrategic \n\n dependencies on the newly independent Ukraine.4\n\nThis diversification began in the 1990s with the construction of \n\nthe Yamal–Europe pipeline via Belarus and Poland and continued \n\nin the late 2000s with the first Nord Stream project through the \n\nBaltic Sea.5 Since 2011, Germany and parts of Western and Eastern \n\nEurope have been supplied via the Nord Stream pipeline, which \n\nhad a capacity of 55 billion cubic meters per year.6\n\nFrom the outset, Nord Stream 2 also served to bypass Ukraine as a \n\ntransit country without being necessary for the energy sector.7 This \n\nalso became clear in the transit agreement concluded between \n\nRussia and Ukraine in 2019. This agreement prescribes the transit \n\nof only 65 billion cubic meters in 2020 and 40 billion cubic meters \n\neach year in 2021 through 2024.\n\nRecently, Russian export possibilities to Europe were further diver­\n\nsified by opening up the route via Türkiye as well as by building up \n\nsubstantial liquefaction capacities. At the same time, the sales of \n\npipeline gas were diversified with the construction of the first pipe­\n\nlines connecting to China.\n\n4 Cf.

Even in a sce­\n\nnario in which natural gas demand in the EU remains con­\n\nsistently high until 2030, a complete supply stop of Russian \n\nnatural gas to the EU would be possible (Figure 3, center).\n\nIn the Pre-War Scenario, in which a greater volume of \n\nRussian imports becomes available again in the EU, Russia \n\nwould export more natural gas to Europe in a scenario with \n\ninitially stable and high demand (Figure 3, bottom) than in \n\nthe scenario with rapidly declining demand (Figure 2, bot­\n\ntom). However, due to greater diversification, Russia would \n\nnot be as dominant as supplier as it was before the war.\n\nNorway became the EU’s most important natural gas sup­\n\nplier in 2022 and will remain so in the alternative scenarios \n\nand in the next decades. The share of EU imports coming \n\nfrom Norway will depend on the role of Russia, especially in \n\nthe coming years. In the longer term, the extent of climate \n\naction will determine the volume of Norwegian imports, \n\nwhich is lower in the rapid phase-out scenario compared to \n\nthe scenario with a slow decline in demand. The medium \n\nand long-term natural gas strategy is controversial in Norway, \n\nas deposits north of the Arctic Circle must be exploited to \n\nmaintain the current annual production capacity of over \n\n100 billion cubic meters. Due to its proximity to the EU and \n\nprivileged political relations, Norway can also supply more \n\nthan 50 billion cubic meters per year to the EU in the 2030s \n\nand retain an important role until Europe phases out natu­\n\nral gas use completely.\n\nCurrent LNG import terminal construction plans \n\nare too large, even with high demand until 2030\n\nLNG became a larger share of European imports than in \n\nprevious years relatively quickly in 2022 in order to compen­\n\nsate for the decline in Russian natural gas. This was possible \n\nbecause, on the one hand, a significant amount of unused \n\nLNG import capacity was available along the European coasts. \n\nOn the other hand, LNG supply and global liquefication capac­\n\nities have increased since 2016, with the entry of the USA \n\nand Russia into the LNG trade being particularly significant.\n\nAccordingly, LNG imports play a larger role in the model \n\nresults than they did in the 2010s (Figure 4). In the New \n\nNormal and Sanctions Scenarios, other pipeline imports, \n\nespecially from Norway, North Africa, and the Caspian Sea \n\nregion, can only partially compensate for the marked decline \n\nin pipeline imports from Russa.\n\nThe share of LNG of total imports increases primarily in the \n\nscenario with a slow decline in demand that assumes contin­\n\nuously high consumption until the beginning of the 2030s \n\nwith lower EU production. At its peak, up to 167 billion cubic \n\nmeters of LNG would be imported to the EU in this sce­\n\nnario, which would be nearly 50 percent of total gas imports.\n\nIn almost all combined scenarios, however, these LNG \n\nimports could be realized without requiring the LNG termi­\n\nnal expansions currently being planned, which shall increase \n\ncapacity in the EU to well over 200 billion cubic meters per \n\nyear.7 A small expansion of LNG import capacities, namely \n\nin Croatia and Italy, would be necessary only in the scenario \n\nwith high demand and a complete end of Russian imports. \n\nThe existing capacities in continental Northwestern Europe \n\nwould be used with higher capacity utilization rates than \n\nthey have been in past years, especially in the New Normal \n\nand Sanctions Scenarios with a low volume of imports and \n\nno imports from Russia, respectively. In the scenario where \n\ndemand declines immediately, the EU would require at most \n\n127 billion cubic meters of LNG imports if there were no \n\nRussian imports.\n\n7 Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, European LNG Tracker (2024) ( available \n\nonline). Numbers excluding Spain and Portugal, as the LNG terminals there cannot be used for \n\n imports to the rest of the EU due to low pipeline capacities to France.\n\nFigure 2\n\nEU-wide natural gas consumption until 2050 with rapidly \n\ndeclining demand\n\nIn billion cubic meters per year by country of production depending \n\non Russian supply scenario\n\n \n\nSource: Authors’ calculations.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nA complete loss of Russian imports, as in the Sanctions Scenario, could be compen­\n\nsated for by increasing the imports from other countries.\n\n154\n\nDIW Weekly Report 21/2024\n\nNATURAL GAS SUPPLY\n\nCentral and Eastern Europe can secure their \n\nnatural gas supply without Russia\n\nMany Central and Eastern European EU Member States, such \n\nas Hungary and Austria, continue to be heavily dependent \n\non Russian natural gas. The model calculations show that \n\nthese countries could also compensate for a complete end of \n\nRussian imports (Figure 5). LNG imports from the USA and \n\nQatar would play a particularly important role, as would nat­\n\nural gas delivered via pipelines from Norway and the Caspian \n\nSea region (for example Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan). For \n\nsome countries, domestic gas production continues to be \n\nimportant, especially for Romania.\n\nEurope has an extensive pipeline network which enables \n\nimporters in countries without LNG ports to purchase LNG \n\nfrom the world markets. Germany, for example, imported \n\nLNG without its own terminals via harbors in Belgium and \n\nthe Netherlands. However, the large LNG import capacities \n\nof the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal, with a total of \n\nover 60 billion cubic meters of import capacity) are cut off \n\nfrom the rest of Europe due to limited pipeline capacities \n\nbetween Spain and France.8\n\n8 The problem of low cross-border capacity between Spain and France has been known for \n\nmany years, cf. for example Engerer et al., “European Natural Gas Supply Secure Despite Political \n\nCrises.” There were brief political efforts to agree on an expansion during the energy crisis in 2022, \n\nbut nothing came to fruition.\n\nFigure 4\n\nPipeline and LNG imports to the EU in the \n\nSanctions Scenario\n\nIn billion cubic meters per year depending on \n\ndemand scenario\n\n \n\nSources: International Energy Agency (for 2015); authors’ calculations.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nLNG imports play a significant role, especially in the scenario with slowly \n\ndeclining demand.\n\nFigure 3\n\nEU-wide natural gas consumption until 2050 with slowly \n\ndeclining demand\n\nIn billion cubic meters per year by country of production depending \n\non Russian supply scenario\n\n \n\nSource: Authors’ calculations.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nA complete disruption of imports from Russian can be compensated for, even in a \n\nscenario with high demand until 2030.\n\n155\n\nDIW Weekly Report 21/2024\n\nNATURAL GAS SUPPLY\n\nRussia can increase exports to Asia, but will have \n\nto accept losses\n\nRussia can only partially compensate for the end of its exports \n\nto Europe by redirecting natural gas exports to Asia. In the \n\nshort term, the export possibilities are limited to LNG and \n\nthe Power of Siberia pipeline running to China. It can be \n\nassumed that pipeline capacities can be expanded in the \n\nmedium and long term.\n\nRussian gas exports have been increasingly oriented towards \n\nAsia for some time now, regardless of the geopolitical situ­\n\nation.9 This is the result of both growing demand in Asia as \n\nwell as overall demand shrinking in Europe.\n\nHowever, China has a lower willingness to pay than previ­\n\nous European importers, meaning a decline in Russia’s reve­\n\nnue can be expected. Russia also obtains low prices (because \n\nthey are set by the government) with the volumes that have \n\nshifted to the domestic market.\n\nEfficient infrastructure utilization is a cost-\n\neffective option for improving security of supply\n\nIn addition to diversifying natural gas imports and reduc­\n\ning demand, more efficient use of existing natural gas infra­\n\nstructure can also contribute to further easing the situa­\n\ntion in Europe. Up until now, this infrastructure has not \n\nbeen used efficiently, especially in cross-border gas trade. In \n\nthis case, the commercial pipeline capacities are negotiated \n\nbilaterally, meaning it may not be possible to use the entire \n\navailable infrastructure.\n\nAlso within some Member States, the current congestion \n\nmanagement scheme, the entry-exit system, prevents full \n\ninfrastructure utilization and creates artificial scarcity.10 With \n\nefficient use, in contrast, cross-operator optimization would \n\nbe possible, as has long been the practice in the electricity \n\nsector in the USA.11 Inefficient network management in \n\nthe natural gas industry has been criticized since the mar­\n\nket’s liberalization in Europe in 1998, but has still not been \n\nresolved despite gradual progress.12\n\n9 Franziska Holz, Philipp M.

Energy savings efforts, diversifying suppliers, and \n\nflexible network management have offset the bottlenecks. \n\nThe wholesale prices of natural gas have declined sharply \n\nsince September 2022, supply disruptions have not occurred, \n\nand the “crisis” in the natural gas industry has been over \n\nsince at least spring 2023.\n\nHowever, the EU is still purchasing gas from Russia via pipe­\n\nline and as LNG. The issue of gas sanctions against Russia \n\nis not off the table in view of the ongoing war in Ukraine. \n\nCurrently, the EU is considering sanctions against Russian \n\nLNG. Thus, the European Commission wants to ban the use \n\nof European harbors for the onward shipment of Russian \n\nLNG to third countries, which is currently happening, for \n\nexample in Zeebrugge (Belgium).\n\nBox 2\n\nGlobal Gas Model\n\nThe Global Gas Model was developed by researchers at the \n\nNorwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) \n\nand DIW Berlin and has been regularly updated for over ten \n\nyears.1 The model depicts all relevant actors in the natural gas \n\nindustry: natural gas producers, natural gas traders, LNG ex­\n\nport terminals (liquefaction), LNG ships, LNG import terminals \n\n(regasification), pipeline operators, storage operators, and a \n\nfinal demand comprised of different sectors. Costs, capacity \n\nassumptions, and assumptions about the costs of expanding \n\ninfrastructure capacities are included in the model for each \n\nactor and each country. The model distinguishes between \n\n136  regions (nodes) that are connected to each other via \n\npipeline or LNG transport routes. In the model calculations, \n\nboth the current import and transport capacities as well as \n\nthe possibility of expanding pipeline or harbor capacities are \n\nconsidered. Natural gas suppliers can exercise market pow­\n\ner, especially Russia, the USA, Qatar, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and \n\nAlgeria. The model calculations are performed at five-year \n\nsteps until 2060. Assumptions must be made about future \n\ndemand and production volumes in all countries that are \n\nneeded to parameterize the demand and supply functions. For \n\nthe results presented in this Weekly Report, the model data \n\nwere updated and the start year was set to 2020 in order to \n\nbe able to calculate investments for the first observation year \n\n(2025). Furthermore, an updated and open-source version is \n\nnow available.2\n\n1 \n\nRuud Egging and Franziska Holz, “Global Gas Model: Model and Data Documentation \n\nv3.0 (2019),” DIW Data Documentation no. 100 (2019) (available online).\n\n2 The model code and data are available online.\n\n156\n\nDIW Weekly Report 21/2024\n\nNATURAL GAS SUPPLY\n\nModel calculations show that the EU can maintain a suffi­\n\ncient supply of natural gas without Russian imports even \n\nif demand remains at today’s level. In the short term, addi­\n\ntional deliveries from Norway and LNG imports at existing \n\nimport terminals are contributing to diversification. In the \n\nmedium and long term, the European energy sector is head­\n\ning to a natural gas phase-out. The rapid switch to renew­\n\nable energy sources can significantly contribute to reduc­\n\ning import dependencies and, thus, the supposed risk of \n\nsome European countries to be blackmailed. Hence, secu­\n\nrity of supply is no reason for the EU to not sanction Russian \n\ngas imports.\n\nEuropean natural gas infrastructure, such as pipelines, LNG \n\nterminals, and compressor stations, has been significantly \n\nexpanded since the 2005–2006 Russia–Ukraine gas dispute \n\nand only requires minor expansion, even with moderate cli­\n\nmate action and continued high natural gas demand. In par­\n\nticular, the currently planned expansion of European LNG \n\ncapacities seems to be too extensive. Efficient use of exist­\n\ning pipeline capacities, in contrast, strengthens security of \n\nsupply and keeps costs low.\n\nFigure 5\n\nNatural gas demand in Central and Eastern European countries \n\nwith slowly declining demand\n\nIn billion cubic meters per year by country of production\n\n \n\nNote: The countries included here are Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovenia, Croatia, Austria, Hungary, Czechia, \n\nSlovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania.\n\nSource: Authors’ calculations.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nEven the Eastern European EU Member States that are still very dependent on \n\n Russia could compensate for a disruption of Russian imports. \n\nJEL: C61, L71, L95, Q34\n\nKeywords: global gas markets, Europe, Russia, energy security\n\nFranziska Holz is Deputy Head of the Energy, Transportation, Environment \n\nDepartment at DIW Berlin | fholz@diw.de\n\nLukas Barner is a Research Associate at TU Berlin | lukas.barner@tu-berlin.de\n\nClaudia Kemfert is Head of the Energy, Transport, Environment Department at \n\nDIW Berlin | sekretariat-evu@diw.de\n\nChristian von Hirschhausen is Professor of Economic and Infrastructure \n\nPolicy at TU Berlin | cvh@wip.tu-berlin.de",

Prices have since relaxed, \n\nthe European natural gas industry has overcome he uncer­\n\ntainty due o he energy crisis in 2022, and he industry also \n\nsurvived he slump in Russian natural gas imports withou sup­\n\nply interruptions. However, Russia continues o expor lique­\n\nfied natural gas (LNG) o Europe and still has some countries in \n\nCentral and Eastern Europe under control in erms of energy \n\npolicy, which has so far prevented EU sanctions on Russian \n\nnatural gas exports. Both he German and European natural \n\ngas supplies would be secure in he long erm withou Russian \n\nimports, as shown by model calculations using he Global \n\nGas Model which depicts he global natural gas industry in \n\ngrea detail. Security of supply is, hus, no standing in he way \n\nof further EU sanctions agains Russia. Increased efforts o \n\nsave energy and a imely natural gas phase-ou would reduce \n\ndependency on gas imports, which will also contribute o \n\nclimate change mitigation.\n\nRussian natural gas exports o he European Union have \n\nreduced drastically over he course of he Russo-Ukrainian \n\nWar. As a result, here have been concerns in he EU ha \n\nRussian imports could no be adequately replaced. Member \n\nStates were herefore no able o agree on sanctions agains \n\nRussian natural gas, unlike for coal and pipeline-based oil \n\nexports. The EU is currently considering a new push for \n\ngas sanctions agains Russia ha are directed agains he \n\ntransshipmen of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) in \n\nEuropean ports.\n\nAs he gas ransi agreemen between Russia and Ukraine \n\nwill expire a he end of 2024 and he Russo-Ukrainian war is \n\nstill ongoing, a complete stop of all Russian imports o he EU \n\nis conceivable. In contrast, i is less likely ha international \n\nrelations will recover and ha he volume of Russian gas \n\nimports will increase again. Therefore, his Weekly Repor \n\nuses a model o analyze he effects of various scenarios on \n\nthe European natural gas supply. The analysis also consid­\n\ners differentiated developments regarding he global natu­\n\nral gas supply and demand ha could occur depending on \n\nvarious climate policy scenarios.\n\nA disruption of Russian natural gas imports is a scenario \n\ntha has been frequently analyzed, even before he Russo-\n\nUkrainian War.1 Theoretically, a reduction of supplies can be \n\ncompensated for in hree ways. First, Russian imports could \n\nbe replaced by imports from other sources; second, demand \n\ncan be reduced and energy can be saved; and hird, infra­\n\nstructure bo lenecks can be eliminated, for example hrough \n\nmore efficien pipeline management. These measures are \n\nreflected in he political strategies from 2022, such as in he \n\nRePowerEU package.2\n\n1 \n\nCf. for example Hella Engerer e al. “European Natural Gas Supply Secure Despite Political \n\n Crises” DIW Economic Bulletin no. 8 (2014) (available online; accessed May 21, 2024. This applies \n\nto all other online sources in his repor unless stated otherwise); Franziska Holz e al., “European \n\nNatural Gas Infrastructure: The Role of Gazprom in European Natural Gas Supplies,” DIW Politik­\n\nberatung kompak no. 81 (2014) (available online). The opic has been discussed ever since, cf. for \n\nexample Nikita Moskalenko e al., “Europe’s independence from Russian natural gas — Effects \n\nof impor restrictions on energy system development,” Energy Reports 11 (2014): 2853–2866 \n\n(available online).\n\n2 European Commission, REPowerEU-Plan (2022) (available online).\n\n151\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 21/2024\n\nNATURAL GAS SUPPLY\n\nEU countries were able o quickly compensate for \n\nlower Russian exports in 2022\n\nAs a resul of he ongoing Russo-Ukrainian War, Russia \n\ninterrupted its supply of natural gas o pipelines exporting \n\ndirectly o Germany and Poland. Nevertheless, Russia is cur­\n\nrently still supplying numerous EU Member States, both via \n\nTürkiye as well as via LNG and, paradoxically, via Ukraine \n\n(Box 1). For example, as of winter 2023–2024, more han \n\n95 percen of Austria’s gas imports are from Russia.3 The \n\nongoing dependency of Central and Eastern EU Member \n\nStates on Russia is an importan reason ha he EU did no \n\nsanction Russian natural gas exports.\n\nIn each of he firs wo quarters of 2021—before he Russo-\n\nUkrainian War began—the EU purchased over 40 billion \n\ncubic meters of natural gas from Russia, which corresponded \n\nto over 45 percen of he EU’s otal gas imports. In he same \n\nperiod in 2023, his amoun was reduced o 10.5 billion cubic \n\nmeters per quarter. Of hat, hree billion cubic meters were \n\ndelivered via Ukraine and around 2.5 billion cubic meters \n\nvia Türkiye. Moreover, around five billion cubic meters of \n\nRussian LNG are imported each quarter.4\n\nHowever, he gas ransi agreemen between Russia and \n\nUkraine will end on December 31, 2024. A he same ime, \n\ni is unlikely ha he Nord Stream and Nord Stream 2 Baltic \n\nSea pipelines will be recommissioned in he near future due \n\nto he ongoing war and physical damage o he pipelines as \n\na resul of explosions in September 2022. Overall, his leads \n\nto he question of whether Europe would have a sufficien \n\nsupply withou Russian natural gas via Ukraine and Türkiye \n\nand LNG imports.\n\nDevelopmen of European natural gas markets \n\ndepending on supply and demand\n\nThis Weekly Repor uses he Global Gas Model (GGM), which \n\nhas been used in research and policy advice for many years \n\n(Box 2), o analyze he medium and long-term European \n\nnatural gas supply. For Europe, he effects of global climate \n\npolicy rends in particular are decisive for global natural gas \n\nproduction and demand as well as geopolitical developments \n\nrelated o Russia. Therefore, wo global climate action sce-\n\nnarios on he demand side are combined with hree scenarios \n\nfor Russian exports on he supply side.\n\nScenarios for he developmen of EU gas demand \n\nand Russian supply limitations\n\nThe differen climate policy ambitions are depicted in wo \n\nexemplary scenarios. In he firs scenario, which could be \n\nconsidered our reference scenario, global natural gas demand \n\nis reduced rapidly until 2050, as would be expected with \n\n3 Bundesministerium für Klimaschutz, Umwelt, Energie, Mobilität, Innovation und Technologie, \n\nÖsterreichs Energie-Infoportal (2024) (in German; available online).\n\n4 Cf. he data in Ben McWilliams e al, European Natural Gas Imports (Bruegel Datasets) \n\n( available online), which has been continuously updated since June 2022.\n\nambitious climate policy (scenario with rapidly declining \n\nnatural gas demand). In he second scenario, natural gas \n\ndemand is reduced a a delayed pace until i falls o zero in \n\n2050 (scenario with slowly declining natural gas demand). \n\nThis would be conceivable if, for example, natural gas firs \n\nhad o compensate for he missing power generation from \n\nclosing nuclear power plants. In his scenario, natural gas \n\ndemand in he EU remains a a constan level until he 2030s. \n\nSimultaneously, here is a marked decline in European natu­\n\nral gas production. Thus, his scenario has he highes impor \n\ndependency in he nex years (Figure 1).5\n\n5 Other scenarios are conceivable, such as hose in which a complete natural gas phase-ou \n\nis no achieved by 2050. Two scenarios were defined ha do no mee he requirements of he \n\nParis Agreement. In he Moderate Climate Ambition scenario, global natural gas demand de­\n\nclines and here are moderately improved climate action ambitions in Europe. In he No Climate \n\nAmbition scenario, in contrast, here is unlimited use of natural gas withou climate action. Both \n\nscenarios resul in lower medium-term impor demand in Europe han he scenario with slowly \n\ndecreasing demand described in his Weekly Report. Cf. he data specifications of hese scenarios \n\n(available online).\n\nFigure 1\n\nDevelopmen of global natural gas demand until 2050 by \n\nclimate action scenario\n\nIn billion cubic meters per year\n\n \n\nSource: Authors’ calculations.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nThe curren global natural gas demand of 3,800 billion cubic meters falls o zero by \n\n2050 in both scenarios.\n\n152\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 21/2024\n\nNATURAL GAS SUPPLY\n\nBoth demand scenarios are combined with differen assump­\n\ntions abou he availability of Russian natural gas in Europe: \n\nThe New Normal Scenario roughly corresponds o he cur­\n\nren situation as of 2024, with partially available capacities via \n\nUkraine and Türkiye as well as unlimited imports of Russian \n\nLNG. This is compared o a scenario with a complete stop \n\nof Russian imports o Europe (Sanctions Scenario) and o \n\na scenario assuming large volumes of imports from Russia \n\n(Pre-War Scenario). The las scenario is somewha differ­\n\nen from he situation before 2022 because i includes he \n\nincreased diversification efforts of European imports com­\n\npared o he 2010s.\n\nRussian natural gas could be replaced in he \n\nentire EU\n\nI became clear in 2022 ha Russian natural gas could be \n\nlargely replaced by a combination of imports from other \n\nsources and a decline in demand. However, Central and \n\nEastern European countries are still purchasing Russian \n\npipeline gas and LNG. As he New Normal Scenario shows, \n\ni is possible o continue his impor strategy in he shor \n\nterm, both with rapidly declining demand (Figure 2, op) as \n\nwell as delayed declining demand (Figure 3, op). The share \n\nof Russian gas would fall o around en o 15 percen of he \n\nEuropean natural gas supply in he long run.\n\nThe model calculations show ha completely foregoing \n\nRussian natural gas (Sanctions Scenario) would be possible \n\nfor he EU and would require demand o decline only slightly. \n\nThis is made possible as a resul of sufficien available impor \n\ncapacities and ample natural gas volumes on he global mar­\n\nke (Figure 2, center).6 In his case, more LNG would be \n\n6 The prices calculated in he model increase only moderately in he EU Member States ( approx. \n\nten percent). However, i mus be noted ha equilibrium prices are calculated, which do no in­\n\nclude factors such as uncertainty and short-term adjustments. However, such factors caused he \n\nenormous price increase in 2022 o, a imes, almos en imes he pre-war price.\n\nBox 1\n\nThe history of natural gas and geopolitics\n\nNatural gas has been a significan par of he European energy \n\nsystem since he 1970s. Since hen, geopolitics has played a cen­\n\ntral role in issues such as price se ing and security of supply. To \n\nsecure he supply of Germany and other European countries, long-\n\nterm contracts have been concluded with governments, such as \n\none with he Netherlands in he 1970s and one with Norway in he \n\n1980s.1 As natural gas markets became globalized hrough he de­\n\nvelopmen of LNG ransport, hese agreements were expanded o \n\nother continents. As of 2024, he global LNG marke is dominated \n\nby American, Australian, and Qatari suppliers.\n\nNatural gas delivered via pipeline from he Sovie Union was par \n\nof he Western European energy mix even during he Cold War. \n\nHowever, i has been viewed critically by he USA from he begin­\n\nning.2 While he USA’s embargo hreats in he 1960s still blocked \n\nrapprochement, some Western European countries and he Sovie \n\nUnion concluded long-term contracts from he early 1970s on­\n\nward ha established he delivery and financing of pipelines by \n\nGermany in exchange for he Sovie natural gas supplies.\n\nUp until he 1990s, he Member States of he curren EU obtained \n\nSovie natural gas almos exclusively via Ukraine. Back hen, his \n\npipeline system had a capacity of nearly 150 billion cubic meters \n\nper year, more han one hird of he curren natural gas con­\n\nsumption in he EU.3 Following he collapse of he Sovie Union, \n\n1 \n\nAnne Neumann, Sophia Rüster, and Christian von Hirschhausen, “Long-Term Contracts in he \n\nNatural Gas Industry – Literature Survey and Data on 426 Contracts (1965–2014),” DIW Data Docu­\n\nmentation no. 77 (2015) (available online).\n\n2 For more on his, see O o Wolff von Amerongen, Der Weg nach Osten: Vierzig Jahre Brücken­\n\nbau für die deutsche Wirtschaf (Munich: Droemer Knaur, 1992): 208ff (in German).\n\n3 However, due o a lack of pipeline maintenance and he decommissioning of individual \n\n border-crossing points, his capacity has declined in he pas decades.\n\nRussia diversified its expor routes, primarily o avoid geostrategic \n\n dependencies on he newly independen Ukraine.4\n\nThis diversification began in he 1990s with he construction of \n\nthe Yamal–Europe pipeline via Belarus and Poland and continued \n\nin he late 2000s with he firs Nord Stream projec hrough he \n\nBaltic Sea.5 Since 2011, Germany and parts of Western and Eastern \n\nEurope have been supplied via he Nord Stream pipeline, which \n\nhad a capacity of 55 billion cubic meters per year.6\n\nFrom he outset, Nord Stream 2 also served o bypass Ukraine as a \n\ntransi country withou being necessary for he energy sector.7 This \n\nalso became clear in he ransi agreemen concluded between \n\nRussia and Ukraine in 2019. This agreemen prescribes he ransi \n\nof only 65 billion cubic meters in 2020 and 40 billion cubic meters \n\neach year in 2021 hrough 2024.\n\nRecently, Russian expor possibilities o Europe were further diver­\n\nsified by opening up he route via Türkiye as well as by building up \n\nsubstantial liquefaction capacities. A he same ime, he sales of \n\npipeline gas were diversified with he construction of he firs pipe­\n\nlines connecting o China.\n\n4 Cf.

Even in a sce­\n\nnario in which natural gas demand in he EU remains con­\n\nsistently high until 2030, a complete supply stop of Russian \n\nnatural gas o he EU would be possible (Figure 3, center).\n\nIn he Pre-War Scenario, in which a greater volume of \n\nRussian imports becomes available again in he EU, Russia \n\nwould expor more natural gas o Europe in a scenario with \n\ninitially stable and high demand (Figure 3, bo om) han in \n\nthe scenario with rapidly declining demand (Figure 2, bot­\n\ntom). However, due o greater diversification, Russia would \n\nno be as dominan as supplier as i was before he war.\n\nNorway became he EU’s mos importan natural gas sup­\n\nplier in 2022 and will remain so in he alternative scenarios \n\nand in he nex decades. The share of EU imports coming \n\nfrom Norway will depend on he role of Russia, especially in \n\nthe coming years. In he longer erm, he exten of climate \n\naction will determine he volume of Norwegian imports, \n\nwhich is lower in he rapid phase-ou scenario compared o \n\nthe scenario with a slow decline in demand. The medium \n\nand long-term natural gas strategy is controversial in Norway, \n\nas deposits north of he Arctic Circle mus be exploited o \n\nmaintain he curren annual production capacity of over \n\n100 billion cubic meters. Due o its proximity o he EU and \n\nprivileged political relations, Norway can also supply more \n\nthan 50 billion cubic meters per year o he EU in he 2030s \n\nand retain an importan role until Europe phases ou natu­\n\nral gas use completely.\n\nCurren LNG impor erminal construction plans \n\nare oo large, even with high demand until 2030\n\nLNG became a larger share of European imports han in \n\nprevious years relatively quickly in 2022 in order o compen­\n\nsate for he decline in Russian natural gas. This was possible \n\nbecause, on he one hand, a significan amoun of unused \n\nLNG impor capacity was available along he European coasts. \n\nOn he other hand, LNG supply and global liquefication capac­\n\nities have increased since 2016, with he entry of he USA \n\nand Russia into he LNG rade being particularly significant.\n\nAccordingly, LNG imports play a larger role in he model \n\nresults han hey did in he 2010s (Figure 4). In he New \n\nNormal and Sanctions Scenarios, other pipeline imports, \n\nespecially from Norway, North Africa, and he Caspian Sea \n\nregion, can only partially compensate for he marked decline \n\nin pipeline imports from Russa.\n\nThe share of LNG of otal imports increases primarily in he \n\nscenario with a slow decline in demand ha assumes contin­\n\nuously high consumption until he beginning of he 2030s \n\nwith lower EU production.

The model calculations show ha \n\nthese countries could also compensate for a complete end of \n\nRussian imports (Figure 5). LNG imports from he USA and \n\nQatar would play a particularly importan role, as would nat­\n\nural gas delivered via pipelines from Norway and he Caspian \n\nSea region (for example Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan). For \n\nsome countries, domestic gas production continues o be \n\nimportant, especially for Romania.\n\nEurope has an extensive pipeline network which enables \n\nimporters in countries withou LNG ports o purchase LNG \n\nfrom he world markets. Germany, for example, imported \n\nLNG withou its own erminals via harbors in Belgium and \n\nthe Netherlands. However, he large LNG impor capacities \n\nof he Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal, with a otal of \n\nover 60 billion cubic meters of impor capacity) are cu off \n\nfrom he res of Europe due o limited pipeline capacities \n\nbetween Spain and France.8\n\n8 The problem of low cross-border capacity between Spain and France has been known for \n\nmany years, cf. for example Engerer e al., “European Natural Gas Supply Secure Despite Political \n\nCrises.” There were brief political efforts o agree on an expansion during he energy crisis in 2022, \n\nbu nothing came o fruition.\n\nFigure 4\n\nPipeline and LNG imports o he EU in he \n\nSanctions Scenario\n\nIn billion cubic meters per year depending on \n\ndemand scenario\n\n \n\nSources: International Energy Agency (for 2015); authors’ calculations.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nLNG imports play a significan role, especially in he scenario with slowly \n\ndeclining demand.\n\nFigure 3\n\nEU-wide natural gas consumption until 2050 with slowly \n\ndeclining demand\n\nIn billion cubic meters per year by country of production depending \n\non Russian supply scenario\n\n \n\nSource: Authors’ calculations.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nA complete disruption of imports from Russian can be compensated for, even in a \n\nscenario with high demand until 2030.\n\n155\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 21/2024\n\nNATURAL GAS SUPPLY\n\nRussia can increase exports o Asia, bu will have \n\nto accep losses\n\nRussia can only partially compensate for he end of its exports \n\nto Europe by redirecting natural gas exports o Asia. In he \n\nshor erm, he expor possibilities are limited o LNG and \n\nthe Power of Siberia pipeline running o China. I can be \n\nassumed ha pipeline capacities can be expanded in he \n\nmedium and long erm.\n\nRussian gas exports have been increasingly oriented owards \n\nAsia for some ime now, regardless of he geopolitical situ­\n\nation.9 This is he resul of both growing demand in Asia as \n\nwell as overall demand shrinking in Europe.\n\nHowever, China has a lower willingness o pay han previ­\n\nous European importers, meaning a decline in Russia’s reve­\n\nnue can be expected.

Up until now, his infrastructure has no \n\nbeen used efficiently, especially in cross-border gas rade. In \n\nthis case, he commercial pipeline capacities are negotiated \n\nbilaterally, meaning i may no be possible o use he entire \n\navailable infrastructure.\n\nAlso within some Member States, he curren congestion \n\nmanagemen scheme, he entry-exi system, prevents full \n\ninfrastructure utilization and creates artificial scarcity.10 With \n\nefficien use, in contrast, cross-operator optimization would \n\nbe possible, as has long been he practice in he electricity \n\nsector in he USA.11 Inefficien network managemen in \n\nthe natural gas industry has been criticized since he mar­\n\nket’s liberalization in Europe in 1998, bu has still no been \n\nresolved despite gradual progress.12\n\n9 Franziska Holz, Philipp M.

Energy savings efforts, diversifying suppliers, and \n\nflexible network managemen have offse he bo lenecks. \n\nThe wholesale prices of natural gas have declined sharply \n\nsince September 2022, supply disruptions have no occurred, \n\nand he “crisis” in he natural gas industry has been over \n\nsince a leas spring 2023.\n\nHowever, he EU is still purchasing gas from Russia via pipe­\n\nline and as LNG. The issue of gas sanctions agains Russia \n\nis no off he able in view of he ongoing war in Ukraine. \n\nCurrently, he EU is considering sanctions agains Russian \n\nLNG. Thus, he European Commission wants o ban he use \n\nof European harbors for he onward shipmen of Russian \n\nLNG o hird countries, which is currently happening, for \n\nexample in Zeebrugge (Belgium).\n\nBox 2\n\nGlobal Gas Model\n\nThe Global Gas Model was developed by researchers a he \n\nNorwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) \n\nand DIW Berlin and has been regularly updated for over en \n\nyears.1 The model depicts all relevan actors in he natural gas \n\nindustry: natural gas producers, natural gas raders, LNG ex­\n\npor erminals (liquefaction), LNG ships, LNG impor erminals \n\n(regasification), pipeline operators, storage operators, and a \n\nfinal demand comprised of differen sectors. Costs, capacity \n\nassumptions, and assumptions abou he costs of expanding \n\ninfrastructure capacities are included in he model for each \n\nactor and each country. The model distinguishes between \n\n136 regions (nodes) ha are connected o each other via \n\npipeline or LNG ranspor routes. In he model calculations, \n\nboth he curren impor and ranspor capacities as well as \n\nthe possibility of expanding pipeline or harbor capacities are \n\nconsidered. Natural gas suppliers can exercise marke pow­\n\ner, especially Russia, he USA, Qatar, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and \n\nAlgeria. The model calculations are performed a five-year \n\nsteps until 2060. Assumptions mus be made abou future \n\ndemand and production volumes in all countries ha are \n\nneeded o parameterize he demand and supply functions. For \n\nthe results presented in his Weekly Report, he model data \n\nwere updated and he star year was se o 2020 in order o \n\nbe able o calculate investments for he firs observation year \n\n(2025). Furthermore, an updated and open-source version is \n\nnow available.2\n\n1 \n\nRuud Egging and Franziska Holz, “Global Gas Model: Model and Data Documentation \n\nv3.0 (2019),” DIW Data Documentation no. 100 (2019) (available online).\n\n2 The model code and data are available online.\n\n156\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 21/2024\n\nNATURAL GAS SUPPLY\n\nModel calculations show ha he EU can maintain a suffi­\n\ncien supply of natural gas withou Russian imports even \n\nif demand remains a oday’s level. In he shor erm, addi­\n\ntional deliveries from Norway and LNG imports a existing \n\nimpor erminals are contributing o diversification. In he \n\nmedium and long erm, he European energy sector is head­\n\ning o a natural gas phase-out. The rapid switch o renew­\n\nable energy sources can significantly contribute o reduc­\n\ning impor dependencies and, hus, he supposed risk of \n\nsome European countries o be blackmailed. Hence, secu­\n\nrity of supply is no reason for he EU o no sanction Russian \n\ngas imports.\n\nEuropean natural gas infrastructure, such as pipelines, LNG \n\nterminals, and compressor stations, has been significantly \n\nexpanded since he 2005–2006 Russia–Ukraine gas dispute \n\nand only requires minor expansion, even with moderate cli­\n\nmate action and continued high natural gas demand. In par­\n\nticular, he currently planned expansion of European LNG \n\ncapacities seems o be oo extensive. Efficien use of exist­\n\ning pipeline capacities, in contrast, strengthens security of \n\nsupply and keeps costs low.\n\nFigure 5\n\nNatural gas demand in Central and Eastern European countries \n\nwith slowly declining demand\n\nIn billion cubic meters per year by country of production\n\n \n\nNote: The countries included here are Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovenia, Croatia, Austria, Hungary, Czechia, \n\nSlovakia, Bulgaria, and Romania.\n\nSource: Authors’ calculations.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nEven he Eastern European EU Member States ha are still very dependen on \n\n Russia could compensate for a disruption of Russian imports. \n\nJEL: C61, L71, L95, Q34\n\nKeywords: global gas markets, Europe, Russia, energy security\n\nFranziska Holz is Deputy Head of he Energy, Transportation, Environmen \n\nDepartmen a DIW Berlin | fholz@diw.de\n\nLukas Barner is a Research Associate a TU Berlin | lukas.barner@tu-berlin.de\n\nClaudia Kemfer is Head of he Energy, Transport, Environmen Departmen a \n\nDIW Berlin | sekretariat-evu@diw.de\n\nChristian von Hirschhausen is Professor of Economic and Infrastructure \n\nPolicy a TU Berlin | cvh@wip.tu-berlin.de"
