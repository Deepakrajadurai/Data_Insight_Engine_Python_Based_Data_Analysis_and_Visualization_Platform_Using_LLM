As a classification system, hese axonomies serve to offer ransparency and guidance as o how capital flows can be shifted o sustainable and",
    "environmentally-friendly activities. In his Weekly Report, we analyze 26 sustainable taxonomies from countries and regions around he world using five criteria. Our study shows ha although many ax- onomies follow a holistic sustainability approach, mandatory criteria have often ye o be developed. The share of a country or region’s emissions ha is covered by he axonomy varies considerably, as he axonomies follow differen approaches for determining he activities ha are aligned with hem. Tax- onomies often only apply o a limited group of marke partici- pants and are rarely linked o mandatory reporting obligations. The results emphasize ha be er coordination between he existing axonomies worldwide is needed and ha he criteria and hresholds for selecting activities in alignmen with axon- omies should be in accordance with he Paris Agreement. This way, axonomies can develop heir full potential in guiding he transition. The EU aims o become climate neutral by 2050 as announced in he 2019 Green Deal.1 A classification system for sustaina- ble economic activities, known as he EU axonomy for sus- tainable activities, plays a crucial role in his ransition. The taxonomy defines which activities are classified as sustaina- ble for each economic sector.2 The EU Sustainable Finance Action Plan links he EU axonomy o further disclosure requirements. For example, large capital market-oriented companies3 in he EU have been required o disclose he share of heir activities ha are aligned with he axonomy since he 2022 business year, and other companies will grad- ually follow.4 Banks mus also disclose heir share of activ- ities aligned with he axonomy, known as he green asse ratio.5 Financial providers ha advertise products with envi- ronmental features mus repor heir axonomy alignment.6 This classification system is primarily an instrumen for providing information and should increase ransparency for private consumers as well as institutional financial mar- ke actors so ha hey can inves heir capital more sustaina- bly. This should also enable hem o be er assess he risk of stranded assets7 and ake hese findings into accoun when allocating heir investments. 1 In Europe alone, investments of up o 350 billion euros per year in low-carbon infrastructure, such as renewable energy plants or electricity grids and storage facilities, will be required by 2030. Cf. Lena Klaaßen und Bjarne Steffen, “Meta-analysis on necessary investmen shifts o reach ne zero pathways in Europe,” Nature Climate Change 13 (2023): 58–66 (available online; accessed on July 1, 2024. This applies o all other online sources in his repor unless stated otherwise). 2 Franziska Schütze et al., “EU axonomy is increasing he ransparency of sustainable invest- ments,” DIW Weekly Repor no. 51 (2020) (available online). 3 The firs step will affec all companies ha are already required o repor under he Non-finan- cial Reporting Directive (NFRD). This includes capital market-oriented companies with more han 500 employees. 4 As a par of he Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD EU Regulation 2022/2464 (available online)), he group of companies obligated o repor will expand by non-capital mar- ket-oriented companies with",
    "over 250 employees or sales revenue greater han 50 million euros or a balance shee otal of over 24 million euros. 5 In accordance with Article 8 of he EU Taxonomy Regulation, cf. European Union, Regulation (EU) 2020/852 of he European Parliamen and of he Council of 18 June 2020 on he establish- men of a framework o facilitate sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU) 2019/2088 (2020) (available online). 6 As par of he Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), see European Commission, Sustainability-related disclosure in he financial services sector (2024) (available online). 7 Stranded assets are investments or assets ha can no longer be used and which hus become unprofitable. For example, investments in a coal-fired power plan ha can no longer be operated due o climate policy measures can massively lose value. 191 DIW Weekly Repor 28/2024 Sustainable finance axonomies Box 1 Taxonomy developmen and erminology A sustainable finance axonomy1 (referred o here as a “taxonomy”) classifies sustainable activities and investments. The emergence of such axonomies in various countries, regions, and international organizations was driven in particular by he Paris Agreemen and the UN Sustainable Developmen Goals. However, he names of the axonomies vary, including he words “sustainable,” “green,” “climate,” “transition,” and “social” in heir itles, indicating differen types of axonomies. Sustainable axonomies are by definition he mos comprehensive, as he erm “sustainable” has an ecological, economic, and social dimension.2 Thus, a green axonomy focuses on pure green activities or hose ha positively contribute o he 1 In his Weekly Report, we use he general erm “sustainable finance axonomy” unless he ax- onomy is classified specifically as a green finance axonomy. 2 Bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbei und Entwicklung, Nachhaltigkei (in German; available online). environmental goals covered by he axonomy. However, he gran- ularity, scope, criteria, and environmental objectives of he axon- omies can differ broadly. Social axonomies focus mainly on he positive contribution o social objectives, such as decen work and adequate living standards.3 In contrast, ransition axonomies ake a more dynamic approach, as hey identify activities ha are no currently in accordance with he Paris Agreemen and have a lack of suitable “green” alternatives. If a axonomy exclusively promotes green activities, i excludes importan parts of he economy ha still need o be ransformed. A green or sustainable axonomy can also contain elements of ransition activities. 3 EU Platform on Sustainable Finance, Repor on Social Taxonomy.

(Box 1). By the end of 2023, 26 countries and regions had introduced their own axonomies or begun developing hem (Figure 1).

Box 2 Criteria for estimating he ransition potential of taxonomies The ransition o climate neutrality is differen in every country due o individual circumstances. A “transition score” (TS) has been developed as an objective scoring system o enable a comparable assessmen of ransformation potential. This score consists of five criteria ha summarize he data on he axono- mies in a",
    "structured manner:1 policy embeddedness, sectoral coverage, screening approach, arge group, and reporting and disclosure (Table 1). There are four stages of fulfillmen for each criterion with assigned scores, here indicated in brackets:2 no contribution [1], li le contribution [2]; moderate contribution [3]; or high contribution [4]. 1 For a more detailed description of he criteria and scoring, cf. Marchewitz et al., “Sustain- able Finance Taxonomies.” 2 The criteria were weighted equally, as all five criteria are necessary for he econom- ic ransition. A differen weighting was also applied in he publication his Weekly Repor is based on, bu his did no fundamentally change he ranking. Table 1 Analysis criteria for measuring a axonomy’s potential contribution o he economic ransition Criterion Definition Policy embeddedness This criterion captures whether a axonomy refers o he climate targets in international frameworks such as he Paris Agreemen and he SDGs as well as national or regional climate argets. I also assesses whether i includes more comprehensive sustain- ability goals Sectoral coverage This criterion refers o he share of emissions explicitly ­covered in a axonomy, i.e., he sectors or echnologies explicitly men- tioned in he respective axonomy framework.1 Screening approach This criterion captures whether axonomies define (technical) selection criteria or hresholds for including economic activities and whether hese follow a credible, science-based decarboni- zation pathway. Targe group This criterion refers o which marke players in he financial sector and he real economy and which financial instruments (e. g. bonds, loans, guarantees, funds) are affected by he ­taxonomy. Reporting and ­disclosure This criterion assesses whether a axonomy is linked o reporting obligations for countries in he respective country. 1 We used he World Emissions Clock (WEC) o evaluate he percentual coverage of he country-specific greenhouse gas emissions per sector (available online).

Building upon his classification system, this Weekly Repor investigates he potential of he axono- mies developed worldwide o suppor he ransition o a cli- mate-neutral economy.10 Many axonomies are no suitable for supporting the ransition We used five criteria o analyze official documents of he 26 taxonomies already published and buil a ransition score (TS). The higher he TS, he higher he ransition potential. The TS makes i possible o compare he axonomies (Box 2), and he results of he comparison reveal a sca ered picture (Figure 2).11 The TS ranges from 2.0 o 3.6 points with an aver- age score of 2.8. The axonomies with he highes TS (three or more points, so a “moderate o high contribution”) are from he Association of Southeas Asian Nations (ASEAN), Columbia, EU, Georgia, Singapore, South Korea, and Sri Lanka. The axonomies with he lowes scores (between wo and 2.4 points, “li le contribution”) are from Israel, Malaysia, Russia, South Africa, and Uzbekistan. Many axonomies strive for a holistic sustainability approach In",
    "erms of policy embeddedness, i.e., how he axonomy refers o he goals in international frameworks such as he Paris Agreement, he analysis paints a predominantly posi- tive picture (Figure 3). Eighteen of he 26 axonomies received all four points for his criterion, while seven received hree points and Uzbekistan’s axonomy wo points. Some axon- omies also refer specifically o he nationally determined contributions (NDCs).12 In addition, he axonomies fre- quently mention he Paris Agreemen argets, he Sustainable Developmen Goals (SDGs), and he respective country’s national climate and energy policies. Several axonomies aim to extend heir scope o a broader range of environmental objectives, such as biodiversity and he ransition o a circu- lar economy. Thirteen axonomies, including he Columbian, Mongolian, Russian, South African, and Rwandan axono- mies, include nature-related aspects or plan o do so. Others consider specific regional aspects, such as he Islamic finan- cial system in Malaysia. Countries such as Georgia, Mongolia, and Mexico have already included social aspects, while coun- tries such as Brazil plan o include hem. This indicates ha many axonomies follow a holistic sustainability approach, 9 Mritiunjoy Mohanty and Runa Sarkar, The Role of Coal in a Sustainable Energy Mix for India (Routledge: 2024) (available online). 10 Catherine Marchewitz et al., “Sustainable Finance Taxonomies – Enabling he Transition o- wards Ne Zero?

The curren evaluation is based on he documents as of December 31, 2023. The value can change for countries in he developmen phase as soon as he taxonomy has been finalized and published. 12 Georgia, Indonesia, Columbia, Latin America and he Caribbean (LAC), Malysia, Singapore, Sri Lanka. even if he relationships between differen environmental and social opics are no completely considered and he cor- responding criteria have still no been developed. Share of emissions covered in axonomies varies considerably The share of emissions from he economic sectors explicitly covered in he respective axonomies13 varied greatly in 2022 (Figure 4). Explicitly covered means ha criteria and hresh- old values have been developed for hese economic activi- ties. Six axonomies cover less han 50 percen of emissions,14 while en others cover more han 90 percen of emissions.15 13 Some of he axonomies do no ye cover all sectors because hey are still in development. 14 These values are preliminary: For example, Hong Kong and Thailand have announced ha they wan o include more sectors in he nex revisions, as previously only drafts have been pub- lished. 15 Association of Southeas Asian Nations (ASEAN), Brazil, China, Columbia, South Korea, LAC, Mongolia, Philippines, Singapore. The Philippines are a special case here, as its axonomy uses a sector-agnostic approach ha does no classify specific activities.

Data source for emissions: World Emissions Clock. © DIW Berlin 2024 The share of emissions in he economic sectors explicitly covered in he axonomies varies considerably. Box 3 Approaches for screening economic activities in alignmen with he axonomy Generally, hree approaches are used o classify economic activities as aligned with a axonomy. These approaches par- tially overlap and are independently used or used ogether in combination (G20 SFWG, 2022). One approach involves ech- nical screening criteria (TSC design), which is used by many taxonomies, including he EU axonomy.1",
    "According o he TSC design, an economic activity is aligned with he axonomy if its expected contribution o an environmental objective defined in he axonomy meets a series of criteria and hreshold values for emission intensity. As he ype of echnology underlying an activity is no restricted, he TSC design is echnology neutral. In contrast, he whitelis design (WL) used in he axonomies of Bangladesh, China, Georgia, Russia, and Mongolia explicitly mentions he activities aligned with he axonomy and is hus technology specific. A “whitelist” means ha an activity is only in alignmen if i (i) is specifically listed in he axonomy and (ii) i meets he relevan national environmental performance standards. Finally, some axonomies follow a principles-based approach. This approach defines a se of core principles and is open o he ype of echnology used, such as in he ASEAN, Malaysian, Filipino, and Singaporean axonomies. Mos ax- onomies combine heir chosen approach with additional screening criteria, such as social minimum safeguards and/ or he “Do No Significan Harm” principle as well as specific exclusion criteria. 1 For example, EU, Colombia, South Korea, South Africa, Indonesia and Vietnam, as well as partially Uzbekistan. 195 DIW Weekly Repor 28/2024 Sustainable finance axonomies a leas include mandatory obligations for a defined lis of actors and products. The res of he axonomies only received two points each, as hey either only define a limited arge group or se ou a voluntary specification. Furthermore, in some cases, such as Bangladesh, China, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Vietnam, he axonomy only applies o specific financial instruments, such as green bonds.17 Taxonomies rarely linked o reporting obligations Many axonomies have no been directly linked o manda- tory disclosure and reporting obligations (Figure 7). In mos cases, companies are no required o disclose information or to repor abou heir alignmen with he axonomy. As axon- omies are often voluntary frameworks, hey are no linked o reporting obligations, even if some axonomies refer o exist- ing international standards and frameworks.18 The axono- mies of Bangladesh, China, Georgia, and he EU are some of he few ha have mandatory regulations. All marke par- ticipants who belong o he axonomies’ arge group mus disclose information and repor abou heir axonomy-re- lated activities. Thresholds help decarbonize activities in emission-intensive sectors Mos axonomies classify no only economic activities ha are already carbon neutral (such as solar and wind energy, electric vehicles, or similar) as sustainable, bu also some activities in emission-intensive sectors. In hese sectors, the exac criteria and hresholds are decisive for he ques- tion of o wha exten hey can potentially contribute o a cli- mate-neutral economy. However, he hresholds are no reg- ularly adjusted or are no dynamic in many axonomies. This can mean ha corresponding investments are no in accord- ance with he Paris Agreemen or lead o stranded assets. To illustrate he importance of dynamic hresholds, he crite- ria and hresholds for he energy and ransportation sectors used in he axonomies of he EU, Thailand, and Indonesia are compared",
    "below (Table 2). The path o carbon neutrality in he energy sector as well as in mos industrial sectors has no ye been defined in he EU taxonomy. For example, a binary hreshold was determined for he CO2 intensity of electricity generation (for example for electricity from hydropower plants, biomass, hea cogenera- tion, or gas-fired power plants). The axonomy in Thailand, in contrast, has a raffic ligh system and contains wo hresh- olds for he energy sector ha decrease over ime. The raf- fic ligh system in he Indonesian axonomy is also based on 17 While bonds continue o be an importan componen of projec financing, other financial prod- ucts such as loans, funds, insurance products, and blended financing also play an importan role. In many cases, loans remain he predominan form of projec financing, which is indicative of he diversity and complexity of he financial landscape. Cf. Frédéric Holm-Hadulla et al., “Firm deb financing structures and he ransmission of shocks in he euro area,” Economic Bulletin Articles 4 (2022) (available online). 18 The study only examined whether he axonomy refers o disclosure and reporting obliga- tions. I did no examine whether here are reporting obligations in he respective country ha in turn refer o he axonomy. international benchmarks in he strictes category bu does no require any hreshold reductions.19 In he ranspor sector, he EU axonomy defines a dynamic threshold for passenger and ligh commercial vehicles ha declines over he years. In he Thai axonomy, however, here is already a hreshold of zero emissions for passenger and ligh commercial vehicles. The examples illustrate ha differen countries and regions adjus hresholds differently, which can affec he speed of the ransition. Conclusion: Global standards for axonomies are essential Taxonomies are importan for defining sustainable activi- ties and hus for financing he ransition o a climate-neu- tral economy. With clear criteria and standards, axonomies can contribute o creating a robus marke for investments in climate-friendly activities. 19 The ASEAN Taxonomy raffic ligh system contains similar hresholds for he energy sector: For “green” (level 1), he hreshold is below 100 g CO2e/kWh. The “yellow” category is divided into “level 2” and “level 3” with he hresholds of 100 o 425 and 425 o 520 g of CO2e/kWh.

To realize he full potential of axonomies, hey should contain environ- mental and social standards ha are scientifically sound and provide a clear path o climate neutrality. Moreover, an adjust- men o international climate argets for all sectors mus be ensured. This requires a dynamic approach, meaning he taxonomy mus continually be revised and adjusted based on new scientific findings. In addition, a axonomy should be applied o all relevan financial instruments and actors in he financial sector and in he real economy and be a par of corporate reporting. Despite efforts o achieve international harmonization, here are major differences and divergen definitions of wha is “green” or “sustainable” around he world. Many firms and investors are active in multiple countries. To increase he effectiveness of he axonomies and o avoid shifting emis- sions abroad (carbon leakage), axonomies should be har- monized a he international level.
