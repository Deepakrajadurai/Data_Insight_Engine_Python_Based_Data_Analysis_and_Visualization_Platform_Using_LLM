This led to consumer price inflation \n\nin the euro area far beyond the ECB’s inflation target of two \n\npercent, at times up to 10 percent. At the same time, the euro \n\narea economy was threatened by a recession, which resulted \n\nin the ECB facing conflicting objectives of stabilizing the \n\neconomy and combating inflation. Estimates show that while \n\nthe ECB’s policy strategy of maintaining a low level of interest \n\nrates did improve the economy, it also exacerbated the rise \n\nin energy prices. The empirical analysis demonstrates that an \n\ninterest rate hike at the beginning of the energy crisis would \n\nhave stabilized inflation more effectively. Tightening mone­\n\ntary policy would have curbed energy demand and caused \n\nthe euro to appreciate, which would have led to a more rapid \n\ndecline in energy prices. In this counterfactual scenario, the \n\neuro area would have had to endure a brief recession, but the \n\noverall economic situation would have stabilized by the fourth \n\nquarter of 2023. The ECB would likely have been better able to \n\nfollow its price stability mandate if a capital markets and fiscal \n\nunion existed in the euro area.\n\nFew issues stir up emotions in Germany as much as infla­\n\ntion. It affects everyone: People’s savings lose value, their \n\nreal wages decline. Moreover, the European Central Bank’s \n\n(ECB) conventional response to a rise in inflation may have \n\na drastic impact on individual households; home loans will \n\nbecome more expensive and job security will become more \n\nat risk. Thus, how to best contain inflation is a hotly con­\n\ntested topic.\n\nIn essence, the optimal response is always a trade-off between \n\ncombating inflation on the one hand and the consequences \n\nof combating it, i.e., dampened economic development and \n\nthe associated rise in unemployment, on the other. When \n\nconfronted with this trade-off, policymakers tend to decide \n\nto tolerate rising inflation rather than the real economic con­\n\nsequences of combating it; as German Chancellor Helmut \n\nSchmidt said in 1972, “Better five percent inflation than five \n\npercent unemployment.”1\n\nHowever, policymakers frequently do not consider the dam­\n\naging effects of inflation on the population, such as a loss of \n\npurchasing power of savings; lower real purchasing power \n\nof salaries and pensions; the corresponding adjustments in \n\nthe economy; and the implied redistribution of wealth from \n\ncreditors to debtors.\n\nWhen the ECB was founded in 1998, great value was placed \n\non its primary objective of price stability—two percent infla­\n\ntion over the medium term of around two years—and neces­\n\nsary independence from politics. While supporting general \n\neconomic policies is its secondary objective, the ECB’s man­\n\ndate clearly states that the secondary objective may only be \n\npursued if this does not compromise the primary objective.2\n\nThus, the ECB’s decision to not increase interest rates amid \n\nrising inflation in early 2022 stirred up controversy. ECB \n\n1 \n\nIn a July 28, 1972, interview with the Süddeutsche Zeitung, Helmut Schmidt said, “It seems to \n\nbe that the German people—to put it bluntly—can better deal with a five percent increase in pric­\n\nes than five percent unemployment.” The abridged quotation is from the October 14, 2006, issue \n\nof Der Spiegel (in German; available online. Accessed on October 2, 2024. This applies to all other \n\nonline sources in this report).\n\n2 Michael Ioannidis et al., “The mandate of the ECB: Legal considerations in the ECB’s monetary \n\npolicy strategy review,” ECB Occasional Paper Series no. 276 (2021).\n\n243\n\nDIW Weekly Report 40+41+42/2024\n\nMONETARY POLICY\n\nPresident Christine Lagarde defended the decision, saying \n\nthat an interest rate hike could not stop the increase in prices. \n\nThis statement was based on the fact that the price increases \n\nin the euro area were primarily due to higher energy prices. \n\nA widely held opinion was that an interest rate hike would \n\nmiss the mark: Although it would curb overall economic \n\ndemand and thus economic development in the euro area, it \n\nwould have no impact on energy prices, which are primarily \n\ndetermined on the world market.3 This assumption allowed \n\nthe ECB to—despite its primary mandate and excessive infla­\n\ntion—choose a strategy that did not endanger the economic \n\nrecovery of the euro area. Using a time series model, this \n\nWeekly Report investigates the effects of this monetary policy \n\nstrategy. Furthermore, it empirically analyses which mone­\n\ntary policy strategy the ECB could have used to provide the \n\noptimal response to rising energy prices while stabilizing \n\ninflation at two percent, and what impact this strategy would \n\nhave had on the economic development of the euro area.\n\n3 However, studies show that this view is based on erroneous assumptions and that the ECB’s \n\ndecisions do influence energy prices within the euro area as well as global energy prices, cf. \n\nGökhan Ider et al., “And Yet They Move: Energy Prices Fall When Key Interest Rates Increase, De­\n\nspite Countervailing Effects,” DIW Weekly Report no. 8 (2023): 73-80 (available online).\n\nA brief introduction to empirical monetary policy \n\nanalysis\n\nWe use an empirical model to analyze the macroeconomic \n\neffects of the ECB’s monetary policy response to the most \n\nrecent surge in inflation.4 This model incorporates the \n\ndynamic relationships between the macroeconomic vari­\n\nables and, furthermore, makes it possible to calculate the \n\ncausal effects of the ECB’s monetary policy strategy. These \n\neffects can in turn be broken down into two parts using the \n\nempirical model. One part is the policy rule, which repre­\n\nsents the endogenous component of monetary policy and \n\ndescribes how the ECB’s interest rate policy responds his­\n\ntorically and systematically to changes in inflation and eco­\n\nnomic output. The other part is an exogenous component \n\nthat includes monetary policy shocks, unexpected deviations \n\nfrom this systematic rule, such as the ECB’s decision to raise \n\n4 This Weekly Report is based on Gökhan Ider, Alexander Kriwoluzky, Frederik Kurcz, and Ben \n\nSchumann, “Friend, Not Foe – Energy Prices and European Monetary Policy,” DIW Discussion \n\nPapers no. 2089 (2024) (available online). The paper also contains a thorough description of the \n\nmethodology.\n\nBox 1\n\nModel and data\n\nWe use a structural vector autoregressive time series model \n\n(SVAR) to investigate how the monetary policy decisions of the \n\nECB have impacted consumer prices, energy prices, and industrial \n\nproduction in the euro area since January 2020. Mathematically, \n\nthe model can be written as:\n\nBYt = c + AYt−1 + … + ApYt−p + εt.\n\nwhere vector Yt indicates the values of the endogenous variables \n\nat time t, whereby Yt−1 indicates the values of these variables in the \n\nprevious period. Thus, the development of all variables in the com­\n\nmon system depends on the value of the other variables at time  t \n\nand the value of the variables in the past p periods. These mutual \n\ninterdependencies are characterized by the matrices B and A. \n\nVector εt describes the “structural shocks” that the economy is ex­\n\nposed to in each period and are the drivers of the dynamic system.\n\nThe SVAR model in this Weekly Report builds off an empirical \n\nmodel from an earlier Weekly Report and models the common \n\ndevelopment of ten macroeconomic variables.1 Monthly data are \n\nused for the estimation. The sampling period was from January \n\n2002 to October 2023, including the coronavirus pandemic. To \n\naccount for the impact of pandemic-related factors and to estimate \n\ntheir economic effects, we use a process particularly developed for \n\nthis purpose.2\n\n1 \n\nGökhan Ider et al., “And Yet They Move: Energy Prices Fall When Key Interest Rates Increase, \n\nDespite Countervailing Effects,” DIW Weekly Report no. 8 (2023): 73-80 (available online).\n\n2 Danilo Cascaldi-Garcia, “Pandemic priors,” International Finance Discussion Paper 1352 (2022).\n\nThe SVAR model makes it possible to decompose the ECB’s \n\nmonetary policy and the associated interest rate path into two \n\ncomponents. First is the monetary policy rule, which represents \n\nthe endogenous components of monetary policy, describes how \n\nthe interest rate policy of the ECB responds historically and sys­\n\ntematically to changes in inflation, economic output, and other \n\nendogenous variables. Second is the exogenous component that \n\ndescribes monetary policy shocks, or unexpected deviations from \n\nthis systematic rule. To estimate the causal effects of unexpected \n\nconventional monetary policy shocks and shocks due to monetary \n\npolicy announcements (forward guidance), the changes in financial \n\nmarket expectations are measured over short-term interest rates \n\n(three months) as well as longer-term interest rates (two years) in \n\na 30-minute time window around the ECB’s monetary policy deci­\n\nsions. If the expectations change in this time window, then there \n\nis an unexpected and thus exogenous component in the ECB’s \n\ndecision with which the financial markets, and thus companies and \n\nhouseholds, did not expect.3 Based on this identifying assumption, \n\nthe historical decomposition makes it possible to calculate the role \n\nof the exogenous component and thus the impact of deviations \n\nfrom the monetary policy rule.4\n\n3 For a more detailed explanation of the methods, see Gökhan Ider et al., “Friend, Not Foe – \n\n Energy Prices and European Monetary Policy,” DIW Discussion Papers no. 2089 (2024) (available \n\nonline).\n\n4 Lutz Kilian and Helmut Lütkepohl, Structural Vector Autoregressive Analysis (Cambridge Uni­\n\nversity Press: 2017).\n\n244\n\nDIW Weekly Report 40+41+42/2024\n\nMONETARY POLICY\n\ninterest rates in April 2011 despite the ongoing effects of the \n\nfinancial crisis.\n\nThis Weekly Report first estimates the contribution of the \n\nexogenous component of monetary policy on the European \n\neconomy and investigates how the economy would have \n\ndeveloped without the exogenous component, meaning with­\n\nout a deviation from its historical, systematic monetary pol­\n\nicy. This sheds light on to what extent the policy strategy cho­\n\nsen was historically unusual and what its impact was. We \n\nthen examine what impact the optimal design of the endog­\n\nenous component would have had on the development of \n\nthe economy.\n\nECB policy contributed to economic recovery\n\nWe employ a process called historical decompositions to \n\nanalyze if and to what extent the ECB deviated from its tra­\n\nditional monetary policy rule during the previous inflation \n\nsurge and what the macroeconomic effects of this deviation \n\nare (Box 1). This makes it possible to decompose the time \n\nseries of variables into a trend that is independent of mone­\n\ntary policy shocks and current short-term economic develop­\n\nments as well as into deviations from this trend. These devi­\n\nations from the trend, in turn, can be explained by structural \n\nshocks, such as exogenous events (like the coronavirus pan­\n\ndemic), unexpected changes in the supply of and demand for \n\ngoods and services, and unexpected monetary policy shocks. \n\nThe ECB can change short-term interest rates unexpect­\n\nedly, which is generally described as a conventional mone­\n\ntary policy shock. It can also influence longer-term interest \n\nrates by applying “forward guidance,” or making a surprise \n\nannouncement on its future monetary policy intentions.\n\nThe results of the historical decomposition show that eco­\n\nnomic activity in the euro area, measured by industrial pro­\n\nduction, experienced a sharp decline and was well below \n\nthe trend rate at the onset of the pandemic. The model cor­\n\nrectly attributes this decline to the effects of the coronavirus \n\npandemic (Figure 1). The ECB responded to these extraor­\n\ndinary circumstances and passed surprising, expansionary \n\nmonetary policy measures to stimulate aggregate demand \n\nand support the recovery of the European economy, such as \n\nthe extensive Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme \n\n(PEPP). The effects of the monetary policy shocks associated \n\nwith these measures were consistently very positive during \n\nthe first two years of the coronavirus pandemic (Figure 1). \n\nWithout the ECB’s expansionary policy, industrial produc­\n\ntion would have been up to 2.5 percent lower and the eco­\n\nnomic recovery would have taken much longer.\n\nMonetary policy strategy exacerbated the energy \n\nprice crisis and boosted inflation\n\nHowever, while the ECB’s continued expansionary monetary \n\npolicy supported the economic recovery, it also played a key \n\nrole in the rise in inflation after the pandemic. At the begin­\n\nning of 2020, inflation in the euro area declined initially due \n\nto the effects of the pandemic on the economy, but increased \n\nFigure 1\n\nEffects of monetary policy shocks on industrial production and \n\ninflation in the euro area\n\nIn percent\n\n \n\nSources: Eurostat; authors’ calculations.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nWhile the ECB’s measures stabilized the economy, they also contributed to inflation \n\nand the rise in energy prices.\n\n245\n\nDIW Weekly Report 40+41+42/2024\n\nMONETARY POLICY\n\nrapidly again as expansionary monetary and fiscal policy, the \n\nend to lockdown measures, and other factors led to a quick \n\neconomic recovery. At the beginning of 2022, inflation was \n\nover three percentage points higher than the two percent tar­\n\nget and rose subsequently to an unprecedented level. The \n\nhistorical decomposition analysis shows that pandemic-re­\n\nlated factors and other non-monetary shocks, such as Russia’s \n\ntightened energy supply since 2021 and the Russian inva­\n\nsion of Ukraine in February 2022, were primarily responsi­\n\nble for the surge in inflation. However, the ECB’s expansion­\n\nary monetary policy also played a major role.\n\nIn particular, the ECB’s lack of response to the rise in infla­\n\ntion actually represented a deviation from its monetary pol­\n\nicy rule. Thus, the monetary policy followed by the ECB \n\nduring the 2022 inflation surge was unusually expansion­\n\nary. The results show that without the deviation from the \n\nempirically estimated historical monetary policy rule, energy \n\nand consumer price inflation would have been much lower. \n\nIn October 2022, for example, when consumer price infla­\n\ntion was eight percentage points above the two percent tar­\n\nget, nearly 1.8 percentage points of this increase were due \n\nto monetary policy shocks and thus the ECB. The situation \n\nis similar for energy prices, where, for example, up to five \n\npercentage points of the observed price increase of 30 per­\n\ncent in January 2022 can be attributed to expansionary mon­\n\netary policy measures.\n\nEconomic development under an optimal \n\nmonetary policy rule\n\nWhile the first analysis provides insight into the importance \n\nof the unexpected, exogenous component of monetary pol­\n\nicy during the last surge of inflation, the second part of this \n\nWeekly Report analyzes the endogenous component, i.e., \n\nthe systematic reaction of the interest rates to changes in \n\nthe economy. This component plays a particularly impor­\n\ntant role in firms’ and households’ expectations regarding \n\nfuture economic development. Prices and wages are set or \n\nnegotiated in view of expected inflation. At the same time, \n\nfirms and households make decisions about long-term invest­\n\nments and consumption, forming their expectations of future \n\ninterest rates and economic activity depending on the per­\n\nceived monetary policy rule. If monetary policy now system­\n\natically operates in such a way that households and firms are \n\nfirmly convinced that the ECB will resolutely counter devi­\n\nations in inflation from the two percent target, they will not \n\nexpect high inflation rates and will adjust their expectations \n\nabout future interest rates as well as their consumption and \n\ninvestment decisions accordingly.\n\nFor the following analysis, it is assumed that the ECB is focus­\n\ning solely on its primary mandate of price stability and that \n\nthere are no deviations from this objective. Thus, the ECB \n\ninfluences short and longer-term interest rates in such a \n\nway that inflation is at two percent in the medium term and \n\nignores everything else, such as general economic develop­\n\nments. The analysis uses an empirical model that makes it \n\npossible to answer the counterfactual question of how the \n\neconomy in the euro area would have developed if the ECB \n\nhad focused chiefly on its primary mandate, an inflation tar­\n\nget of about two percent (Box 2).\n\nIn this counterfactual scenario, the economy faces the same \n\nshocks as was the reality—the coronavirus pandemic and the \n\nenergy price crisis—but the ECB responds systematically to \n\nBox 2\n\nEstimating economic development under \n\nmandate-optimal monetary policy\n\nTo calculate the economic development that would have oc­\n\ncurred under a mandate-optimal monetary policy, we assume \n\nthat the ECB selects its systematic interest rate policy and \n\nthus its monetary policy in a way that it can optimally achieve \n\nits primary mandate of price stability. This means that the ECB \n\naims to minimize deviations from the inflation target of two \n\npercent. This can be expressed in a loss function:\n\n \n\n.\n\nThis loss function cumulates the inflation deviation from the \n\ntwo percent target, whereby the various weights (wi) are se­\n\nlected in such a way that inflation deviations in the “medium \n\nterm” are given a particularly high weighting. This accounts \n\nfor the fact that the ECB defines its primary mandate as price \n\nstability in the “medium term,” which, in practice, is considered \n\nto be four to six quarters. Empirical methods can be used to \n\ncalculate an optimal monetary policy rule.1 Based on this, it is \n\npossible to simulate how the euro area economy would have \n\ndeveloped from April 2021 onward if the ECB’s declared ob­\n\njective had been to achieve the primary mandate in the most \n\noptimal way. This means that the economy in this scenario \n\ncontinues to be exposed to the same exogenous shocks, in­\n\ncluding the coronavirus pandemic and the energy price crisis. \n\nHowever, the ECB responds differently to these events in this \n\nscenario, which is why the macroeconomic impact of these \n\nexogenous shocks is different. At the same time, the ECB’s \n\nalternative monetary policy changes the existing economic \n\ndevelopment even without the resulting change in the effects \n\nof the new exogenous shocks. This is because a change in the \n\nmonetary policy rule also influences dynamic adjustment pro­\n\ncesses within the economy that were already initiated before \n\nthe change. The sum of these responses to new exogenous \n\nshocks and the already existing dynamic adjustment process­\n\nes results in an interest rate path for the short and longer-term \n\ninterest rates, which influences the overall economic situation \n\nand the financial markets and ultimately leads to the ECB opti­\n\nmally achieving its primary mandate.2\n\n1 \n\nTomas E.

This response results in an interest rate path for \n\nthe short and longer-term interest rates that influences the \n\noverall economic situation and the financial markets and \n\nultimately leads to the ECB optimally achieving its primary \n\nmandate (Box 2).\n\nEarlier ECB intervention could have prevented the \n\ninflation surge\n\nThe development of interest rates under a mandate-optimal \n\npolicy rule differs greatly from their actual development. In \n\nparticular, the ECB should have implemented a strong ini­\n\ntial interest rate hike by increasing the short-term and long-\n\nterm interest rates by up to 100 basis points. According to \n\nthe estimates, the ECB could have prevented the sharp rise \n\nin inflation with this strategy.\n\nOne reason for this is that the ECB’s interest rate policy, \n\ncontrary to the ECB’s assumptions described above, directly \n\ninfluences energy prices and the higher interest rates are \n\nvery quickly reflected in noticeably lower energy prices. For \n\nexample, a change in the monetary policy course would have \n\ncaused demand for energy in the euro area to drop drastically \n\nwhile simultaneously appreciating the euro. This would have \n\nfurther dampened energy price inflation in the euro area.5 \n\nAnother reason is that an announcement that the ECB would \n\npursue a policy aimed primarily and vigorously at stabiliz­\n\ning inflation at two percent would also have meant that infla­\n\ntion expectations would not have risen so sharply. This in \n\nturn would have reduced inflationary pressures, as produc­\n\ners, among others, would have forecast lower future costs. \n\nDue to the less pronounced rise in inflation, the ECB would \n\nhave then avoided higher interest rates from 2023 onward.\n\nCombating inflation would have led to only a short-\n\nterm economic slump\n\nSuch a change in monetary policy would have led to an ini­\n\ntial sharper drop in production as measured by industrial \n\nproduction. Considering the relative volatility of GDP and \n\nindustrial production, we see that GDP would have been \n\naround three percent below its actual level at the trough of \n\nthe crisis if the ECB had stabilized inflation at around two \n\npercent (Figure 2). However, this slump would have been \n\nbrief; total production would have returned to its actual level \n\nby the end of 2023. This shows that the conflicting objectives \n\nfaced by the ECB during the energy crisis were of a short-\n\nterm nature. This surprising result is because, contrary to \n\nits own statements and assumptions, the ECB can in fact \n\ndirectly influence energy prices by curbing energy demand \n\nand appreciating the euro.6 Thus, the ECB could have coun­\n\nteracted the rise in inflation driven by the increase in energy \n\n5 Ider et al., “And Yet They Move.”\n\n6 Ider et al., “And Yet They Move”; Alexander Roth and Felix Schmidt, “Not only a mild winter: \n\nGerman consumers change their behavior to save natural gas,” Joule 7, no. 6 (2023): 1081–1086 \n\n(available online).\n\nFigure 2\n\nEconomic development under actual and optimal monetary \n\npolicy\n\nIn percent\n\n \n\nSources: Macrobond; Eurostat; Energy Information Agency; authors’ calculations.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nHad the ECB strictly followed its primary mandate of price stability, inflation would \n\nhave been much lower and industrial production would have only experienced a brief \n\nslump.\n\n247\n\nDIW Weekly Report 40+41+42/2024\n\nMONETARY POLICY\n\nprices without causing a long-term weakening in the econ­\n\nomy and creating unemployment.\n\nConclusion: ECB caught between price stability \n\nand limited capacity for action\n\nThe results of this Weekly Report suggest that the ECB con­\n\ntributed to a further increase in prices with its hesitant action, \n\nincluding both the exogenous components that fueled the \n\nrise in prices and the ECB’s wait-and-see response. With a \n\nstricter and more vigorous monetary policy course, the ECB \n\nwould have been able to prevent inflation rising to 10 percent \n\nat the cost of a brief recession at a time in which the economy \n\nwas already weakened by the coronavirus pandemic and the \n\nRussian invasion of Ukraine. The ECB may have not wanted \n\nto exacerbate the situation. In addition, concerns about the \n\nstability of the financial sector may also have prompted the \n\nECB to not raise interest rates too quickly. The ECB’s false \n\nassumption that it cannot influence energy prices may have \n\nled it to put more weight on stabilizing the economic and \n\npolitical situation in the euro area, rather than following its \n\nprimary mandate of price stability.\n\nUltimately, however, the analysis also shows that it has \n\nbecome more challenging for the ECB to fulfill its primary \n\nmandate of price stability in the economic environment at \n\nthat time. This is because it would have needed the free­\n\ndom to not have to consider the economic situation in the \n\nlargest economies (Germany, France, and Italy) as well as \n\ntheir national debt and financial markets when raising inter­\n\nest rates. However, the ECB does not have this freedom \n\nbecause the euro countries are far from having a common \n\nfinancial policy. Instead, it falls to the ECB to implement an \n\neconomic policy for the entire euro area and to conceal its \n\nvarious design flaws.7 First and foremost, this includes the \n\nlack of a capital markets union and of a fiscal union with a \n\ncommon bond for all euro area countries. Only then will \n\nthe ECB be able to effectively fight inflation in the future. \n\nOtherwise, it will continue to face the impossible challenge \n\nof squaring the circle.\n\n7 Former ECB President Mario Draghi also recently made similar suggestions for improve­\n\nment, cf.

This led o consumer price inflation \n\nin he euro area far beyond he ECB’s inflation arge of wo \n\npercent, a imes up o 10 percent. A he same ime, he euro \n\narea economy was hreatened by a recession, which resulted \n\nin he ECB facing conflicting objectives of stabilizing he \n\neconomy and combating inflation. Estimates show ha while \n\nthe ECB’s policy strategy of maintaining a low level of interes \n\nrates did improve he economy, i also exacerbated he rise \n\nin energy prices. The empirical analysis demonstrates ha an \n\ninteres rate hike a he beginning of he energy crisis would \n\nhave stabilized inflation more effectively. Tightening mone­\n\ntary policy would have curbed energy demand and caused \n\nthe euro o appreciate, which would have led o a more rapid \n\ndecline in energy prices. In his counterfactual scenario, he \n\neuro area would have had o endure a brief recession, bu he \n\noverall economic situation would have stabilized by he fourth \n\nquarter of 2023. The ECB would likely have been be er able o \n\nfollow its price stability mandate if a capital markets and fiscal \n\nunion existed in he euro area.\n\nFew issues stir up emotions in Germany as much as infla­\n\ntion. I affects everyone: People’s savings lose value, heir \n\nreal wages decline. Moreover, he European Central Bank’s \n\n(ECB) conventional response o a rise in inflation may have \n\na drastic impac on individual households; home loans will \n\nbecome more expensive and job security will become more \n\na risk. Thus, how o bes contain inflation is a hotly con­\n\ntested opic.\n\nIn essence, he optimal response is always a rade-off between \n\ncombating inflation on he one hand and he consequences \n\nof combating it, i.e., dampened economic developmen and \n\nthe associated rise in unemployment, on he other. When \n\nconfronted with his rade-off, policymakers end o decide \n\nto olerate rising inflation rather han he real economic con­\n\nsequences of combating it; as German Chancellor Helmu \n\nSchmid said in 1972, “Be er five percen inflation han five \n\npercen unemployment.”1\n\nHowever, policymakers frequently do no consider he dam­\n\naging effects of inflation on he population, such as a loss of \n\npurchasing power of savings; lower real purchasing power \n\nof salaries and pensions; he corresponding adjustments in \n\nthe economy; and he implied redistribution of wealth from \n\ncreditors o debtors.\n\nWhen he ECB was founded in 1998, grea value was placed \n\non its primary objective of price stability—two percen infla­\n\ntion over he medium erm of around wo years—and neces­\n\nsary independence from politics. While supporting general \n\neconomic policies is its secondary objective, he ECB’s man­\n\ndate clearly states ha he secondary objective may only be \n\npursued if his does no compromise he primary objective.2\n\nThus, he ECB’s decision o no increase interes rates amid \n\nrising inflation in early 2022 stirred up controversy. ECB \n\n1 \n\nIn a July 28, 1972, interview with he Süddeutsche Zeitung, Helmu Schmid said, “I seems o \n\nbe ha he German people—to pu i bluntly—can be er deal with a five percen increase in pric­\n\nes han five percen unemployment.” The abridged quotation is from he October 14, 2006, issue \n\nof Der Spiegel (in German; available online. Accessed on October 2, 2024. This applies o all other \n\nonline sources in his report).\n\n2 Michael Ioannidis e al., “The mandate of he ECB: Legal considerations in he ECB’s monetary \n\npolicy strategy review,” ECB Occasional Paper Series no. 276 (2021).\n\n243\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 40+41+42/2024\n\nMONETARY POLICY\n\nPresiden Christine Lagarde defended he decision, saying \n\ntha an interes rate hike could no stop he increase in prices. \n\nThis statemen was based on he fac ha he price increases \n\nin he euro area were primarily due o higher energy prices. \n\nA widely held opinion was ha an interes rate hike would \n\nmiss he mark: Although i would curb overall economic \n\ndemand and hus economic developmen in he euro area, i \n\nwould have no impac on energy prices, which are primarily \n\ndetermined on he world market.3 This assumption allowed \n\nthe ECB o—despite its primary mandate and excessive infla­\n\ntion—choose a strategy ha did no endanger he economic \n\nrecovery of he euro area. Using a ime series model, his \n\nWeekly Repor investigates he effects of his monetary policy \n\nstrategy. Furthermore, i empirically analyses which mone­\n\ntary policy strategy he ECB could have used o provide he \n\noptimal response o rising energy prices while stabilizing \n\ninflation a wo percent, and wha impac his strategy would \n\nhave had on he economic developmen of he euro area.\n\n3 However, studies show ha his view is based on erroneous assumptions and ha he ECB’s \n\ndecisions do influence energy prices within he euro area as well as global energy prices, cf. \n\nGökhan Ider e al., “And Ye They Move: Energy Prices Fall When Key Interes Rates Increase, De­\n\nspite Countervailing Effects,” DIW Weekly Repor no. 8 (2023): 73-80 (available online).\n\nA brief introduction o empirical monetary policy \n\nanalysis\n\nWe use an empirical model o analyze he macroeconomic \n\neffects of he ECB’s monetary policy response o he mos \n\nrecen surge in inflation.4 This model incorporates he \n\ndynamic relationships between he macroeconomic vari­\n\nables and, furthermore, makes i possible o calculate he \n\ncausal effects of he ECB’s monetary policy strategy. These \n\neffects can in urn be broken down into wo parts using he \n\nempirical model. One par is he policy rule, which repre­\n\nsents he endogenous componen of monetary policy and \n\ndescribes how he ECB’s interes rate policy responds his­\n\ntorically and systematically o changes in inflation and eco­\n\nnomic output. The other par is an exogenous componen \n\ntha includes monetary policy shocks, unexpected deviations \n\nfrom his systematic rule, such as he ECB’s decision o raise \n\n4 This Weekly Repor is based on Gökhan Ider, Alexander Kriwoluzky, Frederik Kurcz, and Ben \n\nSchumann, “Friend, No Foe – Energy Prices and European Monetary Policy,” DIW Discussion \n\nPapers no. 2089 (2024) (available online). The paper also contains a horough description of he \n\nmethodology.\n\nBox 1\n\nModel and data\n\nWe use a structural vector autoregressive ime series model \n\n(SVAR) o investigate how he monetary policy decisions of he \n\nECB have impacted consumer prices, energy prices, and industrial \n\nproduction in he euro area since January 2020. Mathematically, \n\nthe model can be wri en as:\n\nBY = c + AYt−1 + … + ApYt−p + εt.\n\nwhere vector Y indicates he values of he endogenous variables \n\na ime , whereby Yt−1 indicates he values of hese variables in he \n\nprevious period. Thus, he developmen of all variables in he com­\n\nmon system depends on he value of he other variables a ime \n\nand he value of he variables in he pas p periods. These mutual \n\ninterdependencies are characterized by he matrices B and A. \n\nVector ε describes he “structural shocks” ha he economy is ex­\n\nposed o in each period and are he drivers of he dynamic system.\n\nThe SVAR model in his Weekly Repor builds off an empirical \n\nmodel from an earlier Weekly Repor and models he common \n\ndevelopmen of en macroeconomic variables.1 Monthly data are \n\nused for he estimation. The sampling period was from January \n\n2002 o October 2023, including he coronavirus pandemic. To \n\naccoun for he impac of pandemic-related factors and o estimate \n\ntheir economic effects, we use a process particularly developed for \n\nthis purpose.2\n\n1 \n\nGökhan Ider e al., “And Ye They Move: Energy Prices Fall When Key Interes Rates Increase, \n\nDespite Countervailing Effects,” DIW Weekly Repor no. 8 (2023): 73-80 (available online).\n\n2 Danilo Cascaldi-Garcia, “Pandemic priors,” International Finance Discussion Paper 1352 (2022).\n\nThe SVAR model makes i possible o decompose he ECB’s \n\nmonetary policy and he associated interes rate path into wo \n\ncomponents. Firs is he monetary policy rule, which represents \n\nthe endogenous components of monetary policy, describes how \n\nthe interes rate policy of he ECB responds historically and sys­\n\ntematically o changes in inflation, economic output, and other \n\nendogenous variables. Second is he exogenous componen ha \n\ndescribes monetary policy shocks, or unexpected deviations from \n\nthis systematic rule. To estimate he causal effects of unexpected \n\nconventional monetary policy shocks and shocks due o monetary \n\npolicy announcements (forward guidance), he changes in financial \n\nmarke expectations are measured over short-term interes rates \n\n(three months) as well as longer-term interes rates (two years) in \n\na 30-minute ime window around he ECB’s monetary policy deci­\n\nsions. If he expectations change in his ime window, hen here \n\nis an unexpected and hus exogenous componen in he ECB’s \n\ndecision with which he financial markets, and hus companies and \n\nhouseholds, did no expect.3 Based on his identifying assumption, \n\nthe historical decomposition makes i possible o calculate he role \n\nof he exogenous componen and hus he impac of deviations \n\nfrom he monetary policy rule.4\n\n3 For a more detailed explanation of he methods, see Gökhan Ider e al., “Friend, No Foe – \n\n Energy Prices and European Monetary Policy,” DIW Discussion Papers no. 2089 (2024) (available \n\nonline).\n\n4 Lutz Kilian and Helmu Lütkepohl, Structural Vector Autoregressive Analysis (Cambridge Uni­\n\nversity Press: 2017).\n\n244\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 40+41+42/2024\n\nMONETARY POLICY\n\ninteres rates in April 2011 despite he ongoing effects of he \n\nfinancial crisis.\n\nThis Weekly Repor firs estimates he contribution of he \n\nexogenous componen of monetary policy on he European \n\neconomy and investigates how he economy would have \n\ndeveloped withou he exogenous component, meaning with­\n\nou a deviation from its historical, systematic monetary pol­\n\nicy. This sheds ligh on o wha exten he policy strategy cho­\n\nsen was historically unusual and wha its impac was. We \n\nthen examine wha impac he optimal design of he endog­\n\nenous componen would have had on he developmen of \n\nthe economy.\n\nECB policy contributed o economic recovery\n\nWe employ a process called historical decompositions o \n\nanalyze if and o wha exten he ECB deviated from its ra­\n\nditional monetary policy rule during he previous inflation \n\nsurge and wha he macroeconomic effects of his deviation \n\nare (Box 1). This makes i possible o decompose he ime \n\nseries of variables into a rend ha is independen of mone­\n\ntary policy shocks and curren short-term economic develop­\n\nments as well as into deviations from his rend. These devi­\n\nations from he rend, in urn, can be explained by structural \n\nshocks, such as exogenous events (like he coronavirus pan­\n\ndemic), unexpected changes in he supply of and demand for \n\ngoods and services, and unexpected monetary policy shocks. \n\nThe ECB can change short-term interes rates unexpect­\n\nedly, which is generally described as a conventional mone­\n\ntary policy shock. I can also influence longer-term interes \n\nrates by applying “forward guidance,” or making a surprise \n\nannouncemen on its future monetary policy intentions.\n\nThe results of he historical decomposition show ha eco­\n\nnomic activity in he euro area, measured by industrial pro­\n\nduction, experienced a sharp decline and was well below \n\nthe rend rate a he onse of he pandemic. The model cor­\n\nrectly a ributes his decline o he effects of he coronavirus \n\npandemic (Figure 1). The ECB responded o hese extraor­\n\ndinary circumstances and passed surprising, expansionary \n\nmonetary policy measures o stimulate aggregate demand \n\nand suppor he recovery of he European economy, such as \n\nthe extensive Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme \n\n(PEPP). The effects of he monetary policy shocks associated \n\nwith hese measures were consistently very positive during \n\nthe firs wo years of he coronavirus pandemic (Figure 1). \n\nWithou he ECB’s expansionary policy, industrial produc­\n\ntion would have been up o 2.5 percen lower and he eco­\n\nnomic recovery would have aken much longer.\n\nMonetary policy strategy exacerbated he energy \n\nprice crisis and boosted inflation\n\nHowever, while he ECB’s continued expansionary monetary \n\npolicy supported he economic recovery, i also played a key \n\nrole in he rise in inflation after he pandemic. A he begin­\n\nning of 2020, inflation in he euro area declined initially due \n\nto he effects of he pandemic on he economy, bu increased \n\nFigure 1\n\nEffects of monetary policy shocks on industrial production and \n\ninflation in he euro area\n\nIn percent\n\n \n\nSources: Eurostat; authors’ calculations.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nWhile he ECB’s measures stabilized he economy, hey also contributed o inflation \n\nand he rise in energy prices.\n\n245\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 40+41+42/2024\n\nMONETARY POLICY\n\nrapidly again as expansionary monetary and fiscal policy, he \n\nend o lockdown measures, and other factors led o a quick \n\neconomic recovery. A he beginning of 2022, inflation was \n\nover hree percentage points higher han he wo percen ar­\n\nge and rose subsequently o an unprecedented level. The \n\nhistorical decomposition analysis shows ha pandemic-re­\n\nlated factors and other non-monetary shocks, such as Russia’s \n\ntightened energy supply since 2021 and he Russian inva­\n\nsion of Ukraine in February 2022, were primarily responsi­\n\nble for he surge in inflation. However, he ECB’s expansion­\n\nary monetary policy also played a major role.\n\nIn particular, he ECB’s lack of response o he rise in infla­\n\ntion actually represented a deviation from its monetary pol­\n\nicy rule. Thus, he monetary policy followed by he ECB \n\nduring he 2022 inflation surge was unusually expansion­\n\nary. The results show ha withou he deviation from he \n\nempirically estimated historical monetary policy rule, energy \n\nand consumer price inflation would have been much lower. \n\nIn October 2022, for example, when consumer price infla­\n\ntion was eigh percentage points above he wo percen ar­\n\nget, nearly 1.8 percentage points of his increase were due \n\nto monetary policy shocks and hus he ECB. The situation \n\nis similar for energy prices, where, for example, up o five \n\npercentage points of he observed price increase of 30 per­\n\ncen in January 2022 can be a ributed o expansionary mon­\n\netary policy measures.\n\nEconomic developmen under an optimal \n\nmonetary policy rule\n\nWhile he firs analysis provides insigh into he importance \n\nof he unexpected, exogenous componen of monetary pol­\n\nicy during he las surge of inflation, he second par of his \n\nWeekly Repor analyzes he endogenous component, i.e., \n\nthe systematic reaction of he interes rates o changes in \n\nthe economy. This componen plays a particularly impor­\n\ntan role in firms’ and households’ expectations regarding \n\nfuture economic development. Prices and wages are se or \n\nnegotiated in view of expected inflation. A he same ime, \n\nfirms and households make decisions abou long-term invest­\n\nments and consumption, forming heir expectations of future \n\ninteres rates and economic activity depending on he per­\n\nceived monetary policy rule. If monetary policy now system­\n\natically operates in such a way ha households and firms are \n\nfirmly convinced ha he ECB will resolutely counter devi­\n\nations in inflation from he wo percen arget, hey will no \n\nexpec high inflation rates and will adjus heir expectations \n\nabou future interes rates as well as heir consumption and \n\ninvestmen decisions accordingly.\n\nFor he following analysis, i is assumed ha he ECB is focus­\n\ning solely on its primary mandate of price stability and ha \n\nthere are no deviations from his objective. Thus, he ECB \n\ninfluences shor and longer-term interes rates in such a \n\nway ha inflation is a wo percen in he medium erm and \n\nignores everything else, such as general economic develop­\n\nments. The analysis uses an empirical model ha makes i \n\npossible o answer he counterfactual question of how he \n\neconomy in he euro area would have developed if he ECB \n\nhad focused chiefly on its primary mandate, an inflation ar­\n\nge of abou wo percen (Box 2).\n\nIn his counterfactual scenario, he economy faces he same \n\nshocks as was he reality—the coronavirus pandemic and he \n\nenergy price crisis—bu he ECB responds systematically o \n\nBox 2\n\nEstimating economic developmen under \n\nmandate-optimal monetary policy\n\nTo calculate he economic developmen ha would have oc­\n\ncurred under a mandate-optimal monetary policy, we assume \n\ntha he ECB selects its systematic interes rate policy and \n\nthus its monetary policy in a way ha i can optimally achieve \n\nits primary mandate of price stability. This means ha he ECB \n\naims o minimize deviations from he inflation arge of wo \n\npercent. This can be expressed in a loss function:\n\n \n\n.\n\nThis loss function cumulates he inflation deviation from he \n\ntwo percen arget, whereby he various weights (wi) are se­\n\nlected in such a way ha inflation deviations in he “medium \n\nterm” are given a particularly high weighting. This accounts \n\nfor he fac ha he ECB defines its primary mandate as price \n\nstability in he “medium erm,” which, in practice, is considered \n\nto be four o six quarters. Empirical methods can be used o \n\ncalculate an optimal monetary policy rule.1 Based on his, i is \n\npossible o simulate how he euro area economy would have \n\ndeveloped from April 2021 onward if he ECB’s declared ob­\n\njective had been o achieve he primary mandate in he mos \n\noptimal way. This means ha he economy in his scenario \n\ncontinues o be exposed o he same exogenous shocks, in­\n\ncluding he coronavirus pandemic and he energy price crisis. \n\nHowever, he ECB responds differently o hese events in his \n\nscenario, which is why he macroeconomic impac of hese \n\nexogenous shocks is different. A he same ime, he ECB’s \n\nalternative monetary policy changes he existing economic \n\ndevelopmen even withou he resulting change in he effects \n\nof he new exogenous shocks. This is because a change in he \n\nmonetary policy rule also influences dynamic adjustmen pro­\n\ncesses within he economy ha were already initiated before \n\nthe change. The sum of hese responses o new exogenous \n\nshocks and he already existing dynamic adjustmen process­\n\nes results in an interes rate path for he shor and longer-term \n\ninteres rates, which influences he overall economic situation \n\nand he financial markets and ultimately leads o he ECB opti­\n\nmally achieving its primary mandate.2\n\n1 \n\nTomas E.

This response results in an interes rate path for \n\nthe shor and longer-term interes rates ha influences he \n\noverall economic situation and he financial markets and \n\nultimately leads o he ECB optimally achieving its primary \n\nmandate (Box 2).\n\nEarlier ECB intervention could have prevented he \n\ninflation surge\n\nThe developmen of interes rates under a mandate-optimal \n\npolicy rule differs greatly from heir actual development. In \n\nparticular, he ECB should have implemented a strong ini­\n\ntial interes rate hike by increasing he short-term and long-\n\nterm interes rates by up o 100 basis points. According o \n\nthe estimates, he ECB could have prevented he sharp rise \n\nin inflation with his strategy.\n\nOne reason for his is ha he ECB’s interes rate policy, \n\ncontrary o he ECB’s assumptions described above, directly \n\ninfluences energy prices and he higher interes rates are \n\nvery quickly reflected in noticeably lower energy prices. For \n\nexample, a change in he monetary policy course would have \n\ncaused demand for energy in he euro area o drop drastically \n\nwhile simultaneously appreciating he euro. This would have \n\nfurther dampened energy price inflation in he euro area.5 \n\nAnother reason is ha an announcemen ha he ECB would \n\npursue a policy aimed primarily and vigorously a stabiliz­\n\ning inflation a wo percen would also have mean ha infla­\n\ntion expectations would no have risen so sharply. This in \n\nturn would have reduced inflationary pressures, as produc­\n\ners, among others, would have forecas lower future costs. \n\nDue o he less pronounced rise in inflation, he ECB would \n\nhave hen avoided higher interes rates from 2023 onward.\n\nCombating inflation would have led o only a short-\n\nterm economic slump\n\nSuch a change in monetary policy would have led o an ini­\n\ntial sharper drop in production as measured by industrial \n\nproduction. Considering he relative volatility of GDP and \n\nindustrial production, we see ha GDP would have been \n\naround hree percen below its actual level a he rough of \n\nthe crisis if he ECB had stabilized inflation a around wo \n\npercen (Figure 2). However, his slump would have been \n\nbrief; otal production would have returned o its actual level \n\nby he end of 2023. This shows ha he conflicting objectives \n\nfaced by he ECB during he energy crisis were of a short-\n\nterm nature. This surprising resul is because, contrary o \n\nits own statements and assumptions, he ECB can in fac \n\ndirectly influence energy prices by curbing energy demand \n\nand appreciating he euro.6 Thus, he ECB could have coun­\n\nteracted he rise in inflation driven by he increase in energy \n\n5 Ider e al., “And Ye They Move.”\n\n6 Ider e al., “And Ye They Move”; Alexander Roth and Felix Schmidt, “No only a mild winter: \n\nGerman consumers change heir behavior o save natural gas,” Joule 7, no. 6 (2023): 1081–1086 \n\n(available online).\n\nFigure 2\n\nEconomic developmen under actual and optimal monetary \n\npolicy\n\nIn percent\n\n \n\nSources: Macrobond; Eurostat; Energy Information Agency; authors’ calculations.\n\n© DIW Berlin 2024\n\nHad he ECB strictly followed its primary mandate of price stability, inflation would \n\nhave been much lower and industrial production would have only experienced a brief \n\nslump.\n\n247\n\nDIW Weekly Repor 40+41+42/2024\n\nMONETARY POLICY\n\nprices withou causing a long-term weakening in he econ­\n\nomy and creating unemployment.\n\nConclusion: ECB caugh between price stability \n\nand limited capacity for action\n\nThe results of his Weekly Repor sugges ha he ECB con­\n\ntributed o a further increase in prices with its hesitan action, \n\nincluding both he exogenous components ha fueled he \n\nrise in prices and he ECB’s wait-and-see response.

The ECB’s false \n\nassumption ha i canno influence energy prices may have \n\nled i o pu more weigh on stabilizing he economic and \n\npolitical situation in he euro area, rather han following its \n\nprimary mandate of price stability.\n\nUltimately, however, he analysis also shows ha i has \n\nbecome more challenging for he ECB o fulfill its primary \n\nmandate of price stability in he economic environmen a \n\ntha ime. This is because i would have needed he free­\n\ndom o no have o consider he economic situation in he \n\nlarges economies (Germany, France, and Italy) as well as \n\ntheir national deb and financial markets when raising inter­\n\nes rates. However, he ECB does no have his freedom \n\nbecause he euro countries are far from having a common \n\nfinancial policy. Instead, i falls o he ECB o implemen an \n\neconomic policy for he entire euro area and o conceal its \n\nvarious design flaws.7 Firs and foremost, his includes he \n\nlack of a capital markets union and of a fiscal union with a \n\ncommon bond for all euro area countries. Only hen will \n\nthe ECB be able o effectively figh inflation in he future. \n\nOtherwise, i will continue o face he impossible challenge \n\nof squaring he circle.\n\n7 Former ECB Presiden Mario Draghi also recently made similar suggestions for improve­\n\nment, cf. Mario Draghi, \"The future of European competitiveness,\" European Commission (2024) \n\n( available online).\n\nJEL: C32, E31, E52, Q43\n\nKeywords: monetary policy, inflation, energy prices, optimal policy\n\nGökhan Ider is a Research Associate in he Macroeconomics Departmen a \n\nDIW Berlin | gider@diw.de\n\nFrederik Kurcz is a Research Associate in he Macroeconomics Departmen a \n\nDIW Berlin | fkurcz@diw.de\n\nBen Schumann is a Research Associate in he Macroeconomics Departmen a \n\nDIW Berlin | bschumann@diw.de\n\nAlexander Kriwoluzky is Head of he Macroeconomics Departmen a \n\nDIW Berlin | akriwoluzky@diw.de"
