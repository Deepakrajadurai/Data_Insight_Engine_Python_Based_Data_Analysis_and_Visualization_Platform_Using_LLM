A sharp rise in construction investment, albei more of a flash in he pan as a resul of mild winter weather, along with strong goods exports helped he economy onto its recov­ ery path and masked he disappointing developmen of private consumption, which sank unexpectedly. However, consumer sentimen has since brightened considerably: Following he recen special payments, employees in many sectors are now earning more on a permanen basis due to pay raises, which increases income security. In conjunc­ tion with he inflation rate now being stable a below he three-percen hreshold, real wages are rising significantly. Added o his is he urnaround in interes rates initiated by he European Central Bank, which is making saving less a ractive and loans more affordable. The UEFA European Men’s Football Championship, which is being held in Ger­ many his year, is also likely o boos consumption, albei slightly. In addition o private consumption, foreign rade will prove to be he second mainstay of he German economy in he forecas period. On he one hand, imports are increasing as he domestic economy becomes stronger. On he other hand, he German expor industry will also experience a significan boost, as industrial production is likely o pick up worldwide. Due o he high share of intermediate products and investmen goods, exports “made in Germany” are particularly dependen on he global industry’s economic situation. In Germany, oo, industrial companies will begin investing more in heir capacities from 2025 a he latest. Construction investmen will hen also rise again. Overall, he outlook is somewha more positive han i was in he spring: Instead of stagnating, DIW Berlin now expects the German economy o grow by 0.3 percen in 2024 and by 1.3 percen in 2025. One risk factor for he forecas is ha he full exten of he damage from he flooding in southern Germany is still unclear. In some places, pro­ duction capacities could remain impaired for longer han expected. A he same ime, i is also conceivable ha repair and reconstruction work could increase economic output. Overall, however, he effects in one way or he other are likely o remain manageable. In addition, he ug-of-war over he nex federal budge could once again become a factor contributing o uncertainty, possibly even more so than was already o be expected after he results of he EU elections in Germany. The global economy will also gain some momentum over the forecas period. The euro area is finally overcoming its weak phase for good and international rade is picking up speed. The interes rate urnaround in he major advanced economies will likely have a positive effec on residential construction and corporate investments from he second half of 2024. Overall, he global economy is expected o",
    "grow by 3.7 percen in 2024 and by 3.6 percen in 2025. 169 DIW Weekly Repor 24+25+26/2024 GLOBAL ECONOMY The global economy developed be er han expected in he firs quarter of 2024 in particular due o he recovery of domestic demand in mos advanced economies. Among the emerging economies, China performed surprisingly well in erms of high exports and strong industrial output. In Europe, real wage increases have finally arrived in he pockets of consumers and are boosting private consumption. Quarter-on-quarter he economy expanded by 0.3 and 0.6 per­ cen in he euro area and he United Kingdom, respectively. Economic growth in he United States was a 0.3 percen and continues o be carried by consumer spending. In contrast, inflation is weighing strongly on domestic demand in Japan, where GDP shrunk by 0.5 percen in he firs quarter of 2024. Of he emerging economies, he Indian and Chinese econ­ omies experienced he mos growth. The Chinese economy expanded by 1.6 percent, more han in he previous quarter; this was driven primarily by industrial outpu and exports, while domestic demand continued o develop weakly. Overall, the global economy expanded by 1.0 percen in he firs quar­ ter of 2024, similar o he fourth quarter of 2023 (Figure 1). The global economy should continue its recovery into he curren second quarter of 2024. The upswing in he advanced economies will receive a bi more momentum, especially due to he euro area economy, where falling inflation rates com­ bined with rising nominal wages are leading o rising real wages. This should boos he purchasing power of consum­ ers as well as domestic demand. The upswing in he United Kingdom is also likely o continue; he favorable outlook for services points o a further increase in consumption. The US economy, in contrast, is expected o expand only mod­ erately, as private households’ remaining excess savings are running out, cooling private consumption. In Japan, high inflation is continuing o weigh on economic growth. The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Indices have been recovering in mos advanced economies since he beginning of 2024. The May values for Japan, he United Kingdom, and the United States are consistently over he hreshold expan­ sion of 50. The value for he euro area remained under 50, bu experienced a strong increase from 45.7 in April o 47.3 in May. Thus, industrial outpu is likely o gradually pick up speed. The emerging economies are expected o cool down in he second quarter following a strong firs quarter. While eco­ nomic developmen in China and India continues o suppor growth, other countries such as Brazil and Mexico are experi­ encing weak growth due o dampened domestic demand. In contrast, here are signs of a recovery in economic momen­ tum in China, mainly due o more expansive monetary and fiscal policies. Moreover, he recovery of he global econ­ omy is likely o boos Chinese exports. Continued dynamic growth is expected for he Indian economy in he second quarter hanks o solid domestic demand.",
    "International rade recovered by 0.3 percen in he firs quar­ ter of 2024, following a decline of 1.9 percen in 2023. Weak demand from advanced economies and ongoing geopolitical turmoil weighed on international rade in 2023. Nevertheless, some rade barriers have partly been dissolved since he beginning of he year: For example, circumventing blockaded trade routes from Asia o Europe by means of an alternative African route is now factored into supply chains and produc­ tion. This and he gradual recovery of he global economy are likely o lead o international rade picking up somewha in 2024, albei less strongly han before he pandemic. One importan reason for his is ha rade policy conflicts, espe­ cially between Western countries and China, will continue to have a dampening effect. The punitive ariffs imposed by the US governmen on Chinese electric vehicles and sem­ iconductors in May 2024 emphasize he fac ha he situa­ tion is no expected o ease anytime soon. Monetary policy in many advanced economies remained restrictive a he beginning of 2024 and interes rates were still high. The firs key interes rate cuts were made in spring Global economy: Advanced economies once again picking up speed Figure 1 Growth of real GDP Quarter-on-quarter percentage growth (lef axis); index 2015 Q1 = 100 (righ axis) Sources: National Statistical Offices; DIW Berlin Economic Outlook Summer 2024. © DIW Berlin 2024 The advanced economies are contributing somewha more o economic growth again. 170 DIW Weekly Repor 24+25+26/2024 GLOBAL ECONOMY 2024 in ligh of lower inflation rates only in isolated cases, such as in Switzerland. I is expected ha other central banks will begin lowering heir interes rates in he summer (Box). In he euro area, his urnaround happened on June 6th, sooner han in he United States and he United Kingdom due o rapidly falling inflation rates. Commodity prices are also no longer likely o provide any price-driving impetus. Japan is a special case, as its inflation is still well above he Bank of Japan’s wo-percen arge as of April 2024 a 2.5 per­ cent, which is unusually high for he country. Monetary policy has once again become somewha less restrictive in many emerging economies. There have already been regular key interes rate cuts in Brazil since he end of 2023 due o declining inflation rates and low economic growth, while Mexico decreased its key interes rates in March 2024. In February 2024, he People’s Bank of China also adopted a more expansive course by lowering its mini­ mum reserves o suppor he struggling economy and com­ ba deflationary rends. In India, he key interes rate will likely no be lowered until he hird quarter because food Box Assumptions and framework conditions The forecas is based on he following assumptions abou he further developmen of key interes rates, exchange rates, and commodity prices (Table). These assumptions were made based on previous development, futures markets prices, and he closing prices on he date of his forecas (14. May 2024). The European Central",
    "Bank (ECB) firs decreased interes rates in June, as was assumed in he spring forecast. After a year of stable interes rates, i has now initiated a urnaround; further interes rate cuts will follow. We assume five subsequen cuts over he forecasting horizon. In detail, we assume a cu of 35 basis points a he September 2024 meeting, and subsequen cuts every quarter of respectively 25 basis points.1 Taken ogether, his leads to a decline of 85 basis points in 2024 and of 75 basis points in 2025. The ECB has hus initiated an interes rate cu before he US Federal Reserve. The Fed and he Bank of England will presum­ ably no lower interes rates until he hird quarter of 2024. Money marke interes rates fell a he beginning of 2024 in antici- pation of he interes rate urnaround.

The refinancing costs for households and companies are 1 Furthermore, he ECB is expected o reduce he corridor between he deposi facility rate and the main refinancing rate o 15 basis points from September 18, 2024. likely o decline as key interes rates fall over he nex years. The return on governmen bonds slightly increased again following a brief decline in winter 2023. I is assumed ha capital marke inter­ es rates will remain largely unchanged over he forecas horizon a 2.6 percen for Germany and 3.1 percen for he euro area. The euro has recently depreciated agains he US dollar due o he interes rate differential. For he forecas period, i is assumed ha the exchange rate of EUR o USD will remain a 1,08 USD per EUR, the level reached a he end of he data period on June 6. Uncertainties abou he gas supply in he coming year resulted in sligh increases in he wholesale price for gas (TTF) recently. However, well-filled gas storage facilities should preven a severe supply shortage. According o futures, he average gas price should be around 30.90 and 35.50 euros per megawa hours in 2024 and 2025, respectively. According o raded futures, he price for Bren oil should increase slightly in he coming months before declining again a he star of 2025 until he end of he forecas period. In 2024, he average price is likely o be 83 USD per barrel before i declines o an average of 78 USD per barrel in 2025. This forecas is also based on political assumptions: We assume tha no further escalations will occur, bu also ha none of he cur­ ren geopolitical crises, such as he Israeli-Hamas war, he Russo- Ukrainian War, and conflic between China and Taiwan, will end.

Fiscal policy during he forecas period is likely o be slightly restrictive in mos economies. On he one hand, his is due o the fac ha measures aken o comba he energy crisis are expiring. On he other hand, higher interes rates are pu ing governments under pressure o reduce expenditure, which is likely o be o he detrimen of medium-term investmen pro­ grams. In he EU, however, he NextGenerationEU recovery funding is stimulating investments in Member States, while the new European fiscal rules are creating leeway for invest­ ments ha suppor growth.1 China is again an exception here: 1 European Parliament, “New EU fiscal rules approved by MEPs,” press release from April 23, 2024 (available online; accessed on May 30, 2024.

The interes rate urnaround in he major advanced economies will likely have a positive effec on residential construction and corpo­ rate investments from he second half of 2024 and primar­ ily in 2025. Private consumption is also likely o suppor he upswing in he advanced economies, which is partly due o the continued good situation on he labor marke and accord­ ingly solid growth in labor income.

A further escalation of he rade conflic with China is also to be expected under a Trump administration.

On average, he advanced economies should expand by 1.7 percen in 2024. Economic outpu will likely increase by 4.9 percen in he emerging economies. Overall, he global economy is expected o grow by 3.7 percen in 2024 (Table 1). As he developmen in he euro area as well as in China was be er han expected in he firs half of 2024, DIW Berlin is increasing its forecas for he entire year by 0.2 percentage points. In 2025, he global economy is likely o increase by 3.6 percent, unchanged from he spring forecast. This forecas is based on several uncertainty factors. On the one hand, geopolitical risks remain quite high. The cri­ ses relating o he ongoing Israel-Hamas War could spread throughou he region; here is also no end o he Russo- Ukrainian War in sight. There are also simmering geopo­ litical conflicts in Asia concerning he Korean peninsula or Taiwan, for example. A possible intensification of hese geo­ political conflicts harbors many risks for he global economy, from emporarily higher energy and resource prices o major trade distortions and real economic losses. A further risk factor is public deb sustainability in ligh of higher interes rates.

Nevertheless, hey are no likely o recover all losses in he long erm.

Together with he strong expansion in he construction industry, industrial production was also able o increase over­ all and contribute positively o gross value added with nearly 0.1 percentage points. However, he overall increase was pri­ marily carried by services; both he consumer-related (around 0.1 percentage points) as well as public (around 0.2 percent­ age points) service sectors experienced a strong expansion. In he curren second quarter, he German economy is likely to increase again by 0.2 percen (Table 2). Private consumption in particular should improve on a sustained basis. Households are slowly gaining purchasing power due o continuously ris­ ing real wages. Following he one-time special payments ha were paid o employees in many sectors in 2023,",

The strong growth in real wages is a relief o low-income households in particular, The German economy is slowly exiting its slump, starting ou 2024 with momentum following weak performance in 2023.3 Economic outpu increased by 0.2 percen in he firs quar­ ter of 2024, more han previously expected (Figure 2).4 The robus growth rate in he firs quarter was due in particular to a surprisingly strong increase in construction investmen as a resul of mild winter weather. In addition, goods exports rose unexpectedly sharply, resulting in a positive rade bal­ ance. Meanwhile, private consumption continued o decline despite falling inflation rates and rising disposable incomes. High interes rates and he German government’s polit­ ical indecisiveness seemed o have dampened consumer sentimen a he beginning of 2024. Even strong growth in real wages seemingly could no boos consumer confidence enough a he beginning of he year o preven a decline in private consumption. The signs for a recovery in private con­ sumption were here a he beginning of 2024: Employmen increased and nominal wages rose significantly, for example in he energy industry and in he public sector a he state level. Together with further declining consumer price infla­ tion, which has been consistently below he hree-percen threshold, real wages rose noticeably. The decline in infla­ tion is primarily due o lower food inflation and lower energy goods prices. Meanwhile, core inflation, which excludes food­ stuffs and energy, rose more strongly in he firs quarter, which was likely largely due o rising prices for services. Goods exports increased markedly, especially he expor of chemical and pharmaceutical products. Chemical products often serve as he intermediate inputs in further production processes. After heir marked declined due o high energy prices, heir recen increase migh poin o a gradual recov­ ery of global industrial production. German goods imports also increased strongly. However, as imports grew less over­ all han exports, here was a positive rade balance in he firs quarter. Private and public investments also supported eco­ nomic output. The main reason for his was he mild weather, which boosted production in he construction industry and led o a significan increase in construction investment, par­ ticularly in residential construction. In contrast, equipmen investmen declined slightly. Gross value added rose somewha more strongly in he firs quarter a 0.3 percen han GDP. Production in he manu­ facturing industry rose slightly.

Household surveys also indicate a lower propensity o save and a greater willingness o consume.

Following he strong star o he year, investments, however, are unlikely o provide any growth stimuli in he curren sec­ ond quarter. A negative countermove o he strong increase in he firs quarter is expected in construction investment, mainly due o a decline in residential construction, where the situation remains extremely ense. Equipmen invest­ men is also likely o fall again slightly in ligh of he still fragile economic situation. Industry is also likely o recover rather slowly. Companies are continuing o view heir situation cautiously. The manu­ facturing industry has been recording fewer and fewer new orders since 2022 and business expectations are improving only slowly. The Global Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index has climbed over he expansion hreshold of 50 in he second quarter of 2024, he firs ime since summer 2023. However, his is primarily due o he services sector, where sentimen has recently brightened considerably; he recovery in private consumption and he positive momentum from the UEFA European Men’s Football Championship should ensure a rapid upturn. In addition o he hospitality sector, further consumer-related service providers and consumer goods manufacturers are also likely o benefi and expand production. The flooding in southern Germany will however likely no significantly disrup production. The recovery of he German economy is projected o gain significan momentum over he further course of he fore­ cast. Private consumption will be he main driver and remain supported by continued positive wage development, rising employment, and declining unemployment.

This should also somewha revive he momentum of private equipmen investmen if companies",
    "expand heir capacities again in view of rising demand, particularly in 2025. In addition, there are strong investmen stimuli from he public sec­ tor. For example, more funds for military expenditure are likely o be drawn from he special fund for he German armed forces (Bundeswehr).

Reconstruction and repair work following he flooding in southern Germany should no substantially alter his picture. In addition o monetary policy, which is only gradually becoming less restrictive, fiscal policy also displays a restric­ tive orientation: A large number of fiscal policy measures tha were introduced in response o he energy price crisis (above all he electricity and gas price brakes, he stabiliza­ tion of ransmission grid fees, and aid for hospitals and care facilities) have already ended or will end in 2024. In",
    "2025, restrictive stimuli such as he end of he ax-free inflation compensation premium are also likely o outweigh expan­ sionary stimuli from he Wachstumschancengesetz (Growth Opportunities Act) and he special fund for he Bundeswehr. In line with his, governmen deficits are expected o decrease slightly, falling from 2.4 percen in relation o GDP in 2023 to 1.9 percen in 2024 and further o 1.3 percen in 2025. All in all, price-adjusted GDP will likely rise slightly by 0.3 percen in 2024 (Table 3). Growth is projected o be 1.3 percen in 2025. Thus, DIW Berlin is increasing its fore­ cas for 2024 by 0.3 percentage points and for 2025 by 0.1 per­ centage points. The main factors for he improved forecasts are he unexpectedly strong firs quarter of 2024 as well as slightly stronger momentum over he course of he year, which should benefi from he fac ha he global economy and, in particular, importan rading partners will recover somewha more quickly. Potential GDP will likely develop weakly until he end of 2028, primarily due o he negative developmen of labor volume. In ligh of he moderate expansion in 2024, he outpu gap in 2024 is likely o grow somewha larger and amoun o an annual average of -1.6 percen of potential GDP. In 2025, he outpu gap is expected o fall o -0.6, and by 2028 i should close completely. Following he significan rise of 5.9 percen in consumer prices las year, inflation is expected o average 2.3 percen in 2024 and 2.0 percen in 2025. Thus, DIW Berlin’s infla­ tion forecas remains unchanged compared o he spring. In ligh of he higher price increases for services, he core rate is likely o average 2.7 percen in 2024 and fall o 2.0 percen in 2025 as wage growth slows. In addition o he global risks, here are also domestic uncer­ tainties for he German economy, such as he recen flood­ ing in he southern par of he country and he associated damage. The consequences of he flooding in Bavaria and Baden-Wür emberg could be much greater han assumed in his forecast. For example, i is possible ha production capacity is disrupted more han initially expected, with he corresponding consequences for industrial output. This is a downside risk for he forecast. However, an upside risk is also conceivable: If damage o residential buildings and public infrastructure is greater han expected, he resulting reconstruction work could boos economic output, espe­ cially from 2025. Another domestic risk for he German economy is he unclear economic policy framework, in particular he upcom­ ing budge for 2025. If a budge agreemen is significantly delayed, his could make private households and companies uneasy and hus lead o a reluctance o consume and invest.
